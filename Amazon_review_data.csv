"We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the ""trucker"" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!",5
"I'm a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6""), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted ""No Trucks"" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.",1
"Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.",3
"Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.",2
"I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.Wayne",1
I am using this with a Nook HD+. It works as described. The HD picture on my Samsung 52&#34; TV is excellent.,5
The cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself.The price is completely unfair and only works with the Nook HD and HD+,2
"This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box. I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)",5
"This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7&#34; to my HDTV through the HDMI cable.  This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook.",4
This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.,5
"This item is just as was described in the original description, works without any issues to be seen. Good product",4
bought for a spare for my 9&#34; Nook HD and it fit perfectly.  Very satisfied with the price much less than on the BN site,5
"My son crewed my HD charger cord so I needed another one, this is exactly like the one my son destroyed.",5
"This is a good beefy 2 amp charger, but it covers two outlets on a power strip. It's ok in a regular wall outlet. The best thing is it uses a standard USB connector so it can charge more than just a Nook (I have a Kindle Fire HD+).",3
"I lost my B&N original cable.  I looked around for an new one.  I tried  a different, cheaper model but it didn't fit my device properly so back to the drawing board.  I ordered this one.  I am satisfied.  It works exactly as expected and fits perfectly.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter.",5
"It does 2A and charges a DEAD Nook in a few hours. It does so with a LOT of heat, compared to most wall worts. I have a dual charger where 1 port is 2.1A and the other is 1A for total output of 3.1A that doesn't run as hot as this. And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubIt does the job adequately as it's designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using (even though it cools off) because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait, but not so much when charging. I guess it's better to have it at the plug.",3
"Go to Target or Barnes and Noble instead, and pay $25 (which is still a huge markup, considering they make the thing for 50 cents.) This is the worst option if you need one of these. It's price gouging, pure and simple.",3
"Works well, a little pricey I think for a charging cable, but then again, not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement",4
"This is a great buy, compared to a $60 or more a retail store.",5
This mount is just what I needed.  It is strong and sturdy.  It folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns.  A perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television.,5
"Great deal, easy to mount and it appears to be fairly sturdy. I mounted a 32 in tv on it and it works great.",5
This mount works really well once you get it up and going.  Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV's and their mounting hole locations.,4
"This wall mount does everything it's supposed to do.  The piece that attaches to the wall isn't overly long, which made it easier to mount the arm in the tight space I needed to mount it in.  The only issues I saw was that the joints were VERY tight initially and as we moved the arm around to install it, the joints loosened up to the point where I had to take the included allen wrench and tighten them up again.",4
for the price you just cant beat this item. I bought it for a house I was selling so I could hang some tv and it worked great. Good quality for the price.,5
"I received the mount, which was well packaged for shipping.  The installation instructions were Moderately clear.  No issues following them, they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing on.My shipment had a mis-cut piece, and was missing 4 screws.  I contacted the Manufacturer, and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day (Shipped out of Texas, so normal mailing times applied)I like how the Mount fits together, and I easily mounted my 60lbs TV by myself.  The part that attaches to the TV has a hook that will hold the TV on the Arm till you bolt it on.It's very adjustable, and pushes almost flush with the wall.I'm very happy, but took one star for the miscut piece.",4
"Took a bit of work, but used this to fit an older vizio 32&#34; monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor. Stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles. The vizio was older and did not have the standard holes, this product fit and holds the tv very stable.",4
I used this for my 47&#34; Samsung. Its fit/feel is great. Easy installation. Appears strong; although I personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time! It is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and I would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed. The movement is fluid and easily adjustable.I am very pleased with my purchase.,5
"This item serves its purpose as well as any other mount.  Its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion.  I am using this to corner-mount a 32"" TV and it works perfectly to hide the mount, receptacles, and cables behind the TV.  Very easy installation as well.",5
I love this mount.  This is the 4th one I've bought and it works great every time.  excellent seller and excellent product,5
I am very glad for buying it.  It is heavy duty and good quality for the price.  It was very easy to install.,5
this holds up my 55inch sony with ease. make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the 2x4 ur mounting to and u won't have any problem--u may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out-- it'll be there till the house falls!!!3inch lag screws is the way to go don't be cheap go buy em.---how much did u pay for the tv????,5
Nice quality still works great... very happy with this purchase... need to add 10 more words.. so what can I say its a wall mount that I haven't had any problems with,5
"Great bracket for small TVs.  I used it on a 19"" LCD and it worked well.  The large mounting plate may block some connections on some TVs.  Installed easily and could be adjusted to make level.  The links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation.  When the TV is in the desired position, you can tighten them up.",4
"I bought this for a 22"" TV for my son. I mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great! I love the angles it can achieve. Fees Very sturdy and well built. It works perfect for my application. Very happy with this purchase!",5
"I am using this mount for a 39 inch Vizio TV and it has been great. The installation process was quick and easy and we LOVE the variety of angles that you can get from this mount. We have it on a side wall in our bedroom and we can pull the tv out and move it completely perpendicular to the wall on which it is mounted if we want to. (We don't usually move it quite perpendicular, but it works to do this.)My only complaint is that the joints are a little on the stiff side. It takes quite a bit of force to move the TV from one position to another. It's a little hard for my wife to do-- especially with the TV mounted about 6ft up on the wall. It may be possible to loosen these pivot points, but I have not tried. I'm a little nervous about making it less stable if I do.Overall, it's a great mount. Highly recommended.",5
"I installed this for my sister who had a 22"" Philips LCD. Nice sturdy mount, with all of the nuts, bolts, screws included. Only problem was that since my tv was so small, and I was using the most inner mounting hols on the mount, the outside edges of the mount covered both the cable connection, and the power cable connection. Instead of returning, (then paying $70 from a local store) I simply went to a hardware store, got a 1 & 1/2 inch boring tool that attaches to a hand drill, and drilled holes into the mount. It was pretty easy, but a bit messy. It is not visible after mounting the TV, so who cares?? It is one thing to consider before buying this, there may be another mount that does not cover your TV connections. Otherwise swivels well, does not sag, good value.",4
"Didn't think it would work as well as it has,because the metal was a lighter guage thanwe expected, but it hardly deflected from theweight of the TV, even extended straight out.",5
"very heavy duty construction, extends, tilts perfectlya steal at this pricewill be happy to buy another 1 or 2 if needed",5
Well constructed wall mount for TV sets up to 37 inches. The mounting  plate has numerous holes for varius sets. Plenty of extra hardware provided. Price was about 1/8th of what it would cost on the open market. I recommend it highly.,5
"I used it to mount a 32"" LCD TV to the wall... about 28LBS.  I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit ""off level"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.",4
"This mount is excellent. It is very well built and sturdy. I used it to mount a 32"" TV and it fit the need perfectly. The price was also very good and much, much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store. I would definitely recommend.",5
Works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the Big box stores. It is super easy to install yourself too. You just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud (oh yea a stud finder too).,5
"We bought this for the tv in our gym as it gets moved around a bit.  It's definitely sturdy and works well.  Our tv in there is 24&#34;,",4
"For the price, you can't beat it. Mine didn't come with any of the screws for the TV, but luckily I had some leftover from another mount so I didn't want to bother returning it. Also, not sure what they mean by tilt, but mine doesn't. The arm extends in and out as said, tv swivels left to right, but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation. Otherwise, can't beat it for the price as in Target/Best Buy etc., these are going for $60+.",3
"Cannot beat this deal anywhere else on the web!  All other retailers are over-priced for what you are getting - a couple pieces of fabricated metal to hold a TV that articulates! This mount is reasonably priced.Pros:  Easy to install (helps to have a cordless driver to drill 6 pilot holes, and to drive in 6 lag screws. You also need to have a stud finder).- Well fabricated- Mount does everything advertised (i.e. articulates - you made need to loosen up some nuts)Con's: Really stretching here since this is a good deal: Instructions could use some help for the ""novice"" DIY'ersInstall tip:  It really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the TV mountInstalled a 15.5 lbs, 26 Inch Flat Panel LCD (VESA 200mm X 100mm) to this mount. Mount works beautifully! I originally had the TV sitting a little high on a stand, but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen (inherent problem with cheaper LCD's - not being directly in front of a LCD screen) - this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to ""tilt down"" the screen.  I would strongly recommend this mount if you are in the market.",5
This mount is easy to install and very sturdy and is very functional and very affordable for the price. A+,5
"Works like a charm! Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!The instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall, however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well! This is a great product for an amazing price!",5
"Easey to put together and install. Used to mount a 37"" LED flat screen. Instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the TV to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job. Well built product for being made in China.wish you could buy American made, better luck next time.",5
I hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my 8 year old son because I wasn't going to put the 55&#34; flat screen on it to find out that it failed. Fully extends out 2 feet. This was worth the money.,5
"Wanted the monitor off of the desk, so we mounted on the wall.  I would have rather had a vertical adjustment as well, but for the price, this unit does the job.",3
"very secure, we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside.  One of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall.  the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall.  I am really happy with this purchase.",5
"I live in a studio condo and I needed something to rotate to see from my bed and my couch on the other side of the main room. Once you figure out which instructions to use (several varieties are included to accommodate different scenarios and tvs), they are pretty thorough. Don't be afraid to tighten specific &#34;joints&#34; and loosen others to get it how you want it.Originally had bought a different one, and be careful of this, but it didn't didn't have near the amount of swing as this one does.",5
Holds the TV fine and the articulation is great.  We use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill.  Has cable mgmt as well.,4
Another great buy from Amazon. The local stores wanted twice the money and the other mounts were cheaply made. this mount is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with it,4
Just to know that the TV will sit off center of where the base is placed. Other than that it has held up and worked.,4
"This is the best mount I have ever found, especially for the price.Home Depot has a nearly identical mount for $90.This mount comes with every fastener you could need from Lags, Hollow Wall Anchors, Spacers, to varying lengths of Metric Fasteners to most if not all TVs.They mount easy and are sturdy; I have a 60&#34; LED TV on one without issue.I also have 32&#34;, 42&#34;, 46&#34;, and 50&#34; TVs on them; I have used these to mount every LED/LCD TV I or friends have mounted.",5
"Quality was excellent. Instructions were clear. It was not clear about a tilt feature, but there was enough to level it when I finished. Be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical. (I was using it for a 23 inch computer screen so I really need it to be level for reading.) Everything I needed plus lots of extra hardware for different situations.",5
"In the process of turning our master bedroom into a fortress of solitude for my wife, we decided to mount ourPanasonic TC-L32X2 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTVon the wall, above the dresser, to save some space. (You can never have enough dresser space for displaying tchotchkes, amirite, fellas?) My wife wanted a fixed wall mount but I thought the viewing angle required some articulation. (In hindsight, fixed would have worked, too.) This unit was highly rated and the price was right. Sold.The installation was straightforward and fairly simple. The only point at which I needed some help was in balancing the TV while I attached it to the arm; otherwise it was all me. I think it looks great; my wife says it reminds her of being in the hospital. (Sorry, Honey.) When we mount thePanasonic VIERA TC-P42S30 42-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTVin the living room, I'll definitely use a flat mount.You could spend four times this much on an articulating TV mount, but I don't see why you would.",5
"I gave this mount 3 stars.5 to start because out of the box, and mounted on the wall, I really liked it for my daughter's room. The ability to move her 26"" TV around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition.I subtracted 1 star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum, about 2 feet away from the wall.1 more star fell off because now that the TV is mounted, the mount seems to sag, even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it. That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact. Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to ""fall"" in that direction on its hinges. SO it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves.Otherwise, it works I guess. But for $50 I'd rather have a stationary mount that I never have to worry about. I would not set a tv larger than a 30"" or so on this. I just don't trust it.",3
"For the price, this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money.",4
"Needed a corner mounted Flatscreen. This did the job well, easy to install. I had to mount in a metal stud, so I used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly. Expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors.",5
"I'd never bought one of these, mainly due to the high prices in the retail stores.  I hadn't looked online much, and hadn't really needed a monitor mounting device until recently.This thing is well built, and it does the job.  It's not fancy but if you are just looking for an inexpensive way to hang a monitor (TV or PC) on the wall this will do the job.  It comes with a nice bag of heavy-duty hardware.  It is primarily designed for mounting TV sets, but you can get it to work with a PC monitor, as long as it has the VESA mounting.It mainly articulates side-to-side and in-and-out.  It'll pivot a bit up and down, but that's limited.",4
"Only gave this four stars because it's only supporting a 32&#34; TV. I think I would be scared to mount a 55&#34; TV on it. If you sprang for a 50&#34; or bigger TV, spend a little more on a properly rated mount. As with any TV mount, make sure you're hitting wall studs with the main screws, don't just use anchors in drywall or you're asking for trouble. LOTS of hardware included in the kit, so mounting any style or brand of TV shouldn't be a problem.",4
"Nothing fancy, just decent quality and simple installation.  As may have been mentioned, one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud.  Use your own.  The TV I mounted with it is an older flat-panel, so it's a little heavier than the news ones.  This thing isn't fazed, and stays where I put it.",4
Amazing how easy it is to move my 46&#34; around on this mount and able to hang off one stud. Nice quality feel to metal it is made of.,5
"Very sturdy. The arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose.  However, the mount works great, just make sure you get that stud just right. I was impressed with the quality and happy with the price.",4
"Don't have anything to really complain about.  EXCEPT there doesn't seem to be a way, or i'm missing it to tilt the TV up or down (ie. mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair).  and i am quite savvy with tools/assembly/etc. And it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the TV to adjust the angle.  No reason to not buy it though.",4
"Bought the mount for my 30&#34; Dell U3011 monitor.  It fits the Dell quite well, and I bought it for it's reach from the wall, it's ability to manipulate, and it's weight capacity.  And in all those respects, I'm quite happy.However, there is a noticeable tilt/sag to the monitor when I have the arm extended.  I'm not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall, as that was expected, but the rotational sag that I sometimes get.",4
"The mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate. The holes don't align so I couldn't put two screws in. I just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment. Then I used zip ties to secure the arm better. I did this because I had to install the tv ASAP and could not wait for a replacement. Also, the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom. This means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned. Again, I did a quick fix. I gave this 2 stars and not 1 because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv, albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount. I should not have to do quick fixes on a product like this.",2
"VERY HAPPY, it looks great, I'm so happy we got it. Holds good, it is a lil hard to get it to the wall. Other then that its fine I love how we have more room in our room. My husband is so happy I ordered this, it only cost us $28 free shipping and FAST(: VERY THANKFUL TO THE SELLER.",5
"I wasn't willing to pay $100 for simply mounting a TV, so I bought this item to give it a shot. I have no real complaints.  It holds the TV up, which is all I wanted.  It does not have smooth pivot points, so if you're planning on moving it around a lot, don't use this one, but if it's going to stay in a static area, this is your mount.",4
"Bought NEW but I could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished.  Plus the was missing the 4 arms but had some other random hardware included.  I made mine work for my 32&#34; set and it serves it's purpose. Just wish the seller was upfront on the condition, I could have bought a used one for $5 less.",1
This is a rather good tv mount. This tv mount works exactly as expected and described. I would buy again.,4
"I had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my 24&#34; LED TV in my bedroom. Other than that, seems to work fine.",3
"I have a 42&#34; Hannspree LCD TV. It weighs 42.5 lbs. Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it. I do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install, at least for when putting the TV on. This would be extremely hard by yourself, especially if you have a bigger TV. Overall, very happy with this mount.",5
Installed easy and in no time at all (finding the stud was the hardest part for me).  Articulates well with the 40&#34; TV on it. I would not hesitate to look for this brand when it is time for the next TV mount.,5
I have two of these now in different rooms. Works well with my Samsung TV'S  for the size noted above,5
"We got this one recently and its a great wall mount. The unit is pretty heavy, so you will need a helper. It also includes a variety of screws to mount also. Our TV documentation stated it was a 400x400 pattern. But after putting hte plate over the back, seems we didn't need the extra extenders as its 200x200. This is on a Samsung 40&#34; 5000 series LEDTV.The arm is hard to push and pull, but that is more due to being new and stiff. Make sure you adjust the tilt angle screws as our unit came with them loose so we had to tighten them.I initially was scared to mount it (what if it falls if I screw up!!!) but its pretty easy. Not only did i use a stud finder to get the general location of the stud, but i also used nails to get the actual edges (those basic studfinders are never &#34;exact&#34;). make sure you do the same.not bad for $30-ish",5
this is a good product.  It went up easily.  I did it myself.  I wish I might have gotten one with a little more adjustment.  It's very rigid.,4
I have purchased 3 of these wall mounts and they hold my 37 and 32 inch flat screens perfectly. I love these and highly recommend them.,5
"Very good item; I am happy wit it, and delivery time was excellent!!  I recomended; is a good support for your LED TV. It is easy to install, and it have extra screws for different sizes TV.",5
"This was perfect for my 24"" LED monitor, I had it up in just a few mins and with no problems.  It included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6' HDMI cable which I was not expecting.",5
"I checked around Amazon as well as some other sites, and decided these were what I needed.  I read the reviews, looked at the pictures and bought two of these.  I received them today.  I unpacked one of them, read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for Amazon.  These mounts are very, very heavy and require 6, yes SIX, screws to mount to the wall.  Are you kidding me?  The TVs are only 22 lbs!  Two screws in the studs and then more damage to the wall than is necessary.  What a joke!  And Lag bolts?  Ever heard of screws?  The other issue is that these are very hard to move.  I bought an articulating wall mount for a reason, and I expect them to be able to move without a wrench in my hand.",1
"Installed easily, has a nice long reach.  Attached a 32&#34; TV for the grandkids and it works out great. accomodates many different size TV's and was a very good price.",5
"For the price.....can't be beat.  I have two TV's hanging in the living room.  No issues, easy to hang.  I would recommend to a friend.",5
Works Great. Holds my 40 inch TV effortlessly. Very well built. Definitely worth the price. Easy to install TV to the mount. Has cord clips. TV can be tilted up or down and sideways. Extends from the wall 24 inches. I highly recommend this brand..,5
"Used this with a Panasonic 22 inch LCD. Very durable and works as advertised.It was advertised as fitting 22""-37"" televisions, but the size of the t.v mounting plate is so large that it covers some of the plug connections on the back of the television. I will have to cut the metal plate to get to the P.C connector if i choose to connect a computer.Haven't decided if i will keep or send back to get something with a smaller mounting plate.Other than that, it's a great product and meets my need for a hanging television.",4
"I have a 47&#34; TV and had no place to put it in my bed room. With this mount it use the space i had a poster hanging. Very easy to install, came with all hard ware.",5
"Great Mount, so many areas of articulation. This was a great gift idea my mother loves it. I have purchased two of them and they are sturdy and give a touch of class to every room you put them in. A must have any video file or those who want to save space in a bedroom or office.",5
This is perfect for what I needed it for. I can move the screen from side to side if I need to and I don't have the TV sitting on my desk.....,5
have not had the opportunity to install the tv mount as of yet - will follow up once mounted in place. great price and quick shipping,5
Why pay the $$$$ at Best Buy when you can get the same products for a fraction of the prices here.  The VideoSecu Long Arm TV Wall Mount Low Profile Full Motion works great.,4
"Pro's: Easy to setup.  Supports many different VESA formats. Has some articulation.  Sturdy construction.  Can be installed by one person w/o too much effort.Con's: Cable guides fall off easily.  The joints are a bit too stiff; you really have to man-handle it to get it fully extended, and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again.  So far I have not noticed any wear from this firm pulling/pushing, but I worry because it is only attached to the studs buy 2 bolts.",3
We bought this for a 55&#34; Vizio and it worked perfectly. I would buy it again and recommend it. Good quality.,5
"I am impressed with the solid design of this TV Wall Mount.  I think this weights more than the 26"" TV it is supporting.  It also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the TV isn't too difficult.  The one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the TV.  This does assure the TV stays put but if you plan to move the TV on the stand a lot this may be a negative.  Overall I am pleased with the stand - it seems like a good value.",4
I bought the uint for a 32 &#34; Tando.  I couldn't get the parts to line up so I bought another fixed type.,3
"Very well made, strong mount the only problem I have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed. Pictures do not distinguish between Stud mount and concrete. Also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsFor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually 1.5 inches wide so this mount only requires 2 lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a 23 lb TV. The four outboard holes on the wall mount are 1.3"" apart so don't try to use them in a wall stud measuring 1.5"" wide.Helpful hint: I have help install at least 6 other wall mounts because of family or friends so I cannot say that I am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to do.After comparing the instructions on this unit to others I have installed I still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail. Some complain that the back plate was too big for the TV they used but it's fits perfect on theLG 32LK450 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTVI am using it on.Works perfectly for the area of the room I am using it in which allows me to rearrange the room without the need to move the TV.",4
"Perhaps I misunderstood how to install the mount, but I:1) Installed the mount to the wall (easy enough)2) Attach TV the mount with some screws (difficult for one person)With one arm I held the TV (heavy!). The other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the TV to the mount. It took quite an effort to hold the TV for that long. Certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier :-)I have another similar mount where the TV back plate and the mount are separate parts. So once the back plate is installed, you slide the connecting parts together. Much easier! :-)",4
"It took about 10 mins to install this TV Wall Mount with a 48 inch Samsung TV.  It does the job, there are much more expensive arms, but this does the trick.",4
"I used this to hang my 40&#34; LCD that I bought back in 07, so it's a heavy TV that outweighs my new 50&#34;.  Everything seems to be made well, it was easy to install myself, and the TV has been hanging for 2 months now from a brick wall at it's full reach.  I can't imagine paying $100 for other TV wall mounts, as well as this one performs.",5
you can't beat the price and the installation was simple as can be. We installed it in our office and it is perfect! no problems and was completed in a matter of minutes,5
"Totally love this product!! I bought two - one for living room, one for bedroom.  I decided to try my hand in the bedroom first (in case I got frustrated and didn't finish the project).I've gotten items needing to be assembled before with all the hardware in one bag -- not so with this product!!  I'm impressed! Every nut, bolt, screw, washer, etc. is clearly packaged (individually by size and labeled!)The Arm also comes assembled -- which I disassembled for easier handling (the wall plate is attached to the Arm with two Carriage Bolts / easy to remove and makes holding in place while bolting to the wall a breeze).Took me 1-1/2 hours from start (gathering my tools) to finish (hanging the TV)  Oh, and I'm a 56 yr old disabled female.  I do have a  lot of construction/tool knowledge however.",5
UPDATE: I have now have purchased 3 of these for work and home and with the lighter LED TV's this is a perfect mount for most sizes - this is a great mount - easy to install - easy to use - easy to expand - easy to mount TVs. I havent found another one that is so useful - even if you dont need it to extend this is still a great mount--- I guess for the price I was expecting something cheaper but I was quite surprised. It was easy to install and works for what I need it for - it may be over kill for a 22 inch LED LCD TV but I like the way it can be moved around.,5
Used this for the bedroom. Put it in the corner but was only able to hit the stud with a couple bolts.,4
The VideoSecu line of articulating wall mounts has become our standard of choice for high quality articulating wall mounts within our home.  The value is such that the convenience of having an articulating wall mount for connecting or reconnecting cables is well worth the few bucks required to mount our HDTVs conveniently to the wall.  Highly recommend this great quality product. This wall mount will secure any of the HDTVs using the VESA 100 or VESA 200 mount pattern. We like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the HDTV with a larger size there's a much better chance we won't need to replace the articulating mount.,5
"you can spend a ton of money on one of these, or you can buy this one.  hung a 32 inch tv with it with no problems.",5
"This is a really well made and engineered product which should be twice the price. It has every kind of leveling and tilting adjustment you could want, and a nice finishing piece that goes over the wall plate and lag bolts.  The mounting process can't be rushed and planning everything out before you start makes all the difference. Just make sure you find the middle of a wall stud for the lag bolts.It easily managed a 47&#34; led lcd which weighs 35lbs, and it might take the extra 10-12 lbs of a 55&#34; led lcd if it's not pulled too far from the wall. Since it can swing out over 20&#34; I'd be carefull about going bigger than the 35lb 47&#34; tv that I mountedThe only thing which was dissappointing were the two plastic wire holders which are junk (very flimsy, one was broken in the package) and shouldn't be included when simple black wire ties work far better.",5
My flat screem computer monitor is very light and didn't need such a heavy duty mount.  The product is fine and would work for monitors much larger and heavier than my 20&#34; LED,3
"The mount I purchased is great. It is designed for TV's 32&#34; and under. The link here, and image are not correct. But, I really thought the mount was build well, was easy to install, and the price was fantastic.",5
Tv has been on wall for a long time.  Hasn't fallen off.  It's metal and considerably cheaper than kits available in stores.,5
"This is exactly what I needed.  It was easy to mount and supports my 40 inch TV (26 lbs) without any issue.  I haven't tested the extension brackets, but the rest of the device is very solid.  I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight, and it's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly (you'll need a few tools).  If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.  Speaking of which, I've mounted two TVs on this, and the box included screws which fit both (in addition to many more).  However, you may need a few more washers.",5
"This TV mount I bought for just $25 easily outdoes similar ones that cost over $100! It comes preassembled, is easy to mount on the wall, and has clear instructions. It also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall. The joints are a little bit stiff, but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldn't be a problem. Definetely a great buy at a agreat price!",5
"I have purchased this mount twice now - one for my bedroom TV, and one for my living room TV.  The bedroom TV is a 35"" LCD, and the TV in the living room is a 55"" LED.  (Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)I will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the TV.  But I think I prefer that - it certainly doesn't feel flimsy, and it stays wherever I put it.A tip for would-be purchasers: make sure your TV supports this mount.  You can usually find your compatible VESA patterns in your user's manual.  (Or a quick online search, perhaps.)  As I often say - when buying online, it pays to do your homework.",5
"Amazon as always 5 stars in service and shipping.The mount was for a VIZIO E260MV 26-Inch. Product comes adequate with a lot of screws, an Alan key and standard nut key that fits all the nuts. The bubble level (with magnet on the side) and cable are a nice addition.Had to cut 1 inch from the top and bottom of the base that gets screwed no to the TV, since it covered some of the inputs. Other wise very practical for my bedroom/Study that has more width so the convenience of swirling is why we wanted this and it does a good job.For the price ($25 and free shipping), its is a really good deal. Would recommend this.",4
This device is somewhat weak even for the 46 inch TV weighing only 31lbs that I'm using it with. after some adjusting it's working ok.,3
Easy to install and the TV is still on the wall after three weeks! I consider this a good value for the money,4
"Very easy to setup, simple instructions, has all the mounting hardware and fits a huge different variety of TV's with great support.",5
Very concerned over hanging a 46&#34; tv on the wall.  Got this mount due to low price.  Very impressed.  No doubt it will handle a 30# TV.  Allows full 90 degree rotation with 21&#34; from wall to centerline at maximum extension.,4
Another gem hidden amoungst the Amazon halls. This works well for my LED tv's. I used the heavy duty mount bolts for mounting my tv on the back porch. I hung on the sucker and it's not coming down. And I'm 190lbs!,5
"It needs improment. I wish it has one more hole to put a screw on the wall.It looks shaky for 55 inch TV. However, it still holds it.",4
quickly shipped to my house and mounted myself. i ordered this for my 32 inch Phillips LCD tv and for the price i paid its a great value. does the job that any other higher priced wall mounts can do. would recommand,5
"Very good materials, very lightweight,  cheaper than others brands. I have a 47&#34; LG Led tv and it fit at 100%, and I'm capable of sell my tv, buy an 55&#34; and use the same mount without problems.",5
"Made in china, but this time , its well made. nice and sturdy and lots of options to mount differenct type of LCD. It has a good viewing set of angles and can be adjusted just about any view you want. the value for cost here is big, since most of these sale for over 75.00, or over 100.00 at wm. im pleased with it.",5
"Mount went up easily and seems sturdy enough.  However, adjusting the TV sometimes leaves the TV crooked.  Also, it is almost impossible to adjust tilt without using the provided tools.  Even after using the tools, we couldn't really adjust the tilt to the full amount.",4
"Great functionality, really incredible price, and a snap to install.  Honestly, ridiculously good product - wish they were all so easy.",5
Quick and easy installation - very solid product. Very pleased with this purchase.When in need of this type mount again I will certainly purchase this brand/model again.Great price on Amazon makes it very easy.,5
Excellent buy! We are very pleased with this item. It performs very well. The instructions were clear. It was easy to assemble. It holds a 47&#34; TV very well.,5
"Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",4
"Too Heavy and Poor weld quality .Lot of blow holes in welding, though painting was made nice to cover it or else it was made with inefficient welder. I think this is is not well designed by experts. Hope no calculations are involved in making it. Just copied the shape forms some other manufacturer.",3
"i bought a funky double hinged wall mount from amazon and it did not work. I went to best buy and they said to purchase this $350 wall mount they had, I snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box, came home and found this one to be near similar. Needless to say I now have my 47 in LG flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living room.",5
I have 3 swivel mounts and this one is not the best. If you don't use the swivel feature frequently or don't place it where it may be bumped it will do the job. I prefer the strength and stability offered by mounts which have TWO arms extending from a longer wall bracket. These more stable brackets can be found at similar or slightly higher prices. Also look for a feature which allows the TV Bracket (and TV) to be lifted off the swivel arm more conveniently.,3
JUST IN STALL ANOTHER SAMSUNG 55&#34; LED FLAT SCREEN. OUTSIDE A  PATIO DECK AREA WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS UNIT MADE.THE MOUNTING KIT WAS VERY EASY TO USE. AGAIN I DID UPGRADED TO  USING LONGER HEAVIER MOUNTING BOLTS. THAT WAS ONLY $1.00 MORE BUT IT'S WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN. HERE IN EARTHQUAKE COUNTRY YOU NEES THAT SUPPORT. YOUR FLATSCREEN TV RETRACTS A FEW INCHES OFF THE WALL PLUS IT WILL LOOK SWEET FROM 2&#34; TO 24&#34; FROM WALL AREA,5
"For a good wall mount of a smaller TV, this is perfect. Much cheaper than similar in various stores, and actually is more flush/compact than I have seen on others with all the adjustments you could want.Only gripe is that the included wrench to tighten the wall bolts is pretty weak and strips itself almost immediately, but it'll work to get it on at least. All hardware needed is included, I had to use a few adapter pieces on my first TV. Getting ready to hook a second one up on another rooms wall, both are 32"" screens. I feel confident they will be there until I decide to remove em.Wall stud mounting required, but depending on the stud size, you may only get two of the three wall bolts into the stud. Should be enough though.",5
"I use this arm to mount my 39 inch Vizio. I'm surprised my TV has a 100x100 mount thingy. It can tilt left and right, up and down. I do wish it swiveled the TV so that it wasn't crooked. When the bolts get loose, my TV looks crooked.",5
Was a perfect fit for my 32&#34; flat screen TV.  I would recommend this wall mount for that size tv,5
"Good wall mount. Sturdy and does what it is supposed to do. In fact, it even held a larger TV than what it was listed as capable of holding. I believe I mounted a 42&#34; television with this one. Not a flat-flat one either. I mounted an older heavy thick one.",5
"This was half the price of the TV mounts at Costco and perfectly fits a Vizio 37&#34; TV for the spare bedroom. It will work with many different brands so in my book that is great. Strong, sturdy and robust.",5
"This is possibly one of the best mounting kits I've ever purchased. I like the fact that there are pieces so the mounting kit can cater to all models of TV. (Whether they have a rounded or flat back). Mine had a flat back so I didn't need the extra piece, but once that step was cleared it was only a matter of minutes before it went up on my wall.  The adjustable arm is nice, as it is setup in our bedroom. At night the TV is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall, and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk - also making the ability to view the TV while working.The material is very strong, hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didn't even budge.  This thing seems as though it will last quite a long time.  It's already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom, I'll be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model TVs.",5
Exactly as described.Very heavy duty.Lots of parts to make any installation work.Excellent value.Fits various monitors and tvs.,5
"I bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house. I love all three of them. All mounts have different tv's on them, One is a 50&#34;, 40&#34; and a 32&#34;. Product comes with multiple screw for different tvs. Outstanding product for the price. All tv's have been mount for a little over a year. This product is a full motion mount for $29.99!! and it is Prime!",5
Awesome price and quality. Simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation. If you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one I'd recommend.,5
"I mounted this in my RV and it holds a 26"" LCD TV / DVD combo.  Installation was very easy and the mount works GREAT!  I was prepared to pay 5 times the price for a mount that would work as I wanted.  I couldn't be happier.",5
Got my TV mounted with this above my PC and its been on the wall for a year now. No problems with it holds the TV well and its study. Way cheaper than store bought and its perfect for what I got i got a 37 inch HDTV,5
I really like the action on this mount.  I purchased a 27&#34; monitor for my wife and this mount really frees up the desktop real estate.  I would purchase again.,5
"I have an older very heavy 36&#34; Samsung High Def TV that weighs substantially more than my new 42&#34;. I replaced my old basement CRT tv with it, installed the VideoSecu mount easily and it does the job. I was amazed, the price from Amazon was only $30 dollars and with prime I got free 2 day shipping. The original price was $149. Wow, what a reduction!",4
"Used this for a Panasonic 32"" LCD TV.  Mount works fine, instructions were minimal.  I was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the TV and to attach the mount to the wall.  I did have a problem hanging the TV, per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV, this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount, mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount, this was a lot easier.",4
"The product is good and as described.I have a 32&#34; Vizio TV and somehow, this wall mount seems to be a little too weak for my TV. I still managed to mount my TV just fine, but gets a little paranoid that it will give in within the next few months because the mount won't be able to carry it.But the full motion swing feature is amazing! Especially if you are in a larger room.",3
"The TV is still hanging from the wall so that's a good thing. The info for this wall mount says it is good for up to 66 LBS. Our old Phillips 37&#34; flat screen weighs 58 LBS (including the stand) and after 3 weeks the TV and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical 2 x4&#34; frame member. The mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts, bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand TVs. I had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old Phillips.",5
"Bought this mount for a 32inch Panasonic LED TV. The mount may look cheap, but I found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price. I strongly recommend it to everyone.",5

"Good, strong mount and quality hardware. Includes all the different size screws required to attach to TV if yours doesn't have them (or if you lost them).  There is just the right amount of resistance in the joints for it to stay where you want it but still easy to move around.  I mounted a shelf above the TV to get the cable box out of the way and avoid having to run a long HDMI cable through the wall.I took a star only because I received a different unit than the one pictured, It has 2 thick arms, rather than the 2-1 that is shown.  Honestly I think what I got is more attractive, but I believe that Amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization.  My unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture, it has a mounting plate with all of the VESA mounting holes in the correct configuration.  My TV is 26&#34; so it fit perfectly.  I am sure my 55&#34; would fit on it too, but I have a different mounting configuration for that one.",4
"Very solid...we mounted our flat panel in the bedroom. Like the tipping feature and love the articulating feature.We checked prices at stores, big boxes, etc. best price of all including Costco...",5
I bought this tv swing arm mount for my tv from amazon.Its been a good one its built heavy duty to hold pretty big tv .I would have anyone of my friends buy this same mount for their tv. It lets you hang it up and out of the way and also you can turn it out or in adjustable to see it from anywhere I set in my living room. This unit is easy to mount on wall and put together by yourself but if you have an extra person around it would make it a little better when holding the tv up when it clips in at top then screw and tighten and adjustments and like everything else I've bought from amazon it ships fast right to your door step.,4
Easy to attach. Easy to adjust. Very Solid and secure. Used on a clients 29&#34; LED with built in DVD.,5
I have my 32 inch Tv on the wall and it works great. Easy to install and came with all the parts. The screws that it comes with for the TV will not fit but you can buy some for 2 dollars.,5
"For the money you can't go wrong. Yes, it has a litlle play in the mechanism but, you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that. It works great and frees up counter space. I would do it all again. Why spend 3 times more.",4
I love this mount! All the adjustments for tilt and extension are awesome! Holds a Sony 32in Ex-3000 just fine even fully extended. Even bought another. A++Mike,5
"I have this mounted on my wall in my editing studio.  It holds a 27"" LCD monitor (about 20-25lbs).  It's been up for a week and I don't expect that it will fall down anytime soon.",5
"My students and I used to huddle around laptops to discuss projects. Now I have a 47&#34; TV for display and this mount makes it possible to put it on any wall and swivel it in any direction depending on how many people need to see the screen. Really stable, no wiggling",5
"It is a good value, but is not top notch quality. If you extend both arms in the same direction, the TV (30 inch) tilts. However if the arm goes right, then left, the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great.",4
"The mount itself seems fine, it just didn't work with the Phillips tv we bought....the 'x' arm things did not line up and if they did then the 'x' parts would have covered the holes for the inputs...........we ended up using one we had had around here.......seems to be built well though and sturdy",3
"Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.  Make sure you get help when installing.",4
"It is up know and should work fine, but it was hard to get it to fit my TV due to the bulge on the bottom, but I made it work and it is on the wall.",4
"Very strong for any tv, but I wish that it was little longer I am very happy with it and very strongly recommended.",5
"Easy install!! Looks great and works great for what we need!! Purchased for game room, took 5 min. to install and 1 min. to set TV on. Great!!",5
"It is a solid mount and I doubt that it will ever fail to hold the 22"" LED TV that is mounted on it.  My only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the TV is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans (up to 1.25"" from one side of the TV to the other ~16"") but for the price I can live with that.",3
"The mount works, but it is unrefined compared to other brands out there. Purchased because it was on sale. just ok.",3
"I consider myself to be a good DIYer. I've installed mounts for my 2 Samsung 46"" and 55"" LED TVs with no problems for 5 years. So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32"" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4"" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions.This to me is a major product defect. Luckily with Amazon I was able to return this mount but had to pay return S&H;.",1
Works great for a cheap mount. Worked great on a 32&#34; Emerson LCD tv. Does everything as advertised! Can tighten or loosen joints for easier movement.,5
We needed something to Extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick. It went up with no a problems. It worked out very well!,5
"its a little flimsy and not the easiest to put together, for the price it works.  But for the quality i'd go with Cheetah.",3
We needed a wall mount for a 32&#8221; TV that was going to be in the screened in porch.  This was one of the brands recommended by the guy that was going to install out wall mount.  I can&#8217;t speak to the ease or difficulty of installation but it looks great and we can swivel it if necessary for best viewing angle.  It's also pretty sleek so it doesn't butt out too much.  It arrived quickly and it didn&#8217;t take the installer long but of course he was a professional.  Looks great!,5
It works for the tv I bought but I had to use some of my own washers for the screws.  I thought it would have everything.,4
"I have mounted a 42 inch old LCD. Easy to install. Easy to swivel, there is tilt option but it has to be locked by nuts(it can not be changed without loosing the nuts).",5
I wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it. This does that well.  I don't move it often it seems strong and well built. If you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an Allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot. The articulation is sketchy. For my uses and the cheap price this was perfect.,5
"I have purchased a total of 4 HDTV wall mounts from the VideoSecu companyand they are all quality products at a very reasonable price.-Tilt TV Mount: for stationary TVs up to 65 inches.-Articulating:  corner mount for SMALL TVs-Long Arm:  corner or high mobility mount for LARGER TVsAll of them are excellent products, and very easy to install.",5
"Received this item quickly and well packaged (But not so well that I was infuriated trying to open it)Everything was in perfct order. Strong, handsome appearance. Installation Kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios.  Couldn't possibly be happier with this product.",5
"Could offer a little more in flexibility of installation, but once in place the set can be placed in just the right position repeatedly.",4
The directions stink. Just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be ok.,5
It is better than spending twice the money on this going into a brick and mortar store. Was very pleased.,5
"Good quality.  Must mount on a stud.  I mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall, adding a 2 ft 2x4 in the metal stud track, patched the hole and then put up the mount.  Holds a 37&#34; TV without a problem,even added a DVD player to the bottom of the TV and it is still on the wall after about 8 months.  Price on this item was great and it was sent with FREE FREIGHT!",5
"This item didn't disappoint. It's sturdy, has all the screws included for different flat screen models and yes, it works well.",5
This worked perfect.  The universal design would fit 99.9% of the TV's as advertised.  Easy to mount and very durable.,5
"I have a full 42&#34; HD flat screen mounted on this. Not only does everything look better than strapped to a table, but the adjustability makes this mount a pleasure to have.  It was simple to attach to the wall and has a small footprint, being a single stud wall mount.  The other major point of this mount is how many sized TV or monitors the mount can be adjusted to accept.  My TV mounts solidly and the mount itself is solid, yet adjusts with little effort.  This is just plainly a good and solid product that is well worth the money.",5
"had a couple of guys put this up for me, but they said it was easy to install. I like the fact that I can move it around easily and tilt it anyway I want it to be.",5
This product is user friendly and versatile.It is easy to install and comes with everything needed for installation.Adding bidding could drill and bit,5
it was so easy to install.  the instructions were simple and so was the process.  i was putting off the project for fear.  i should have hung the TV long ago.,5
works great was pretty easy to put up and does the trick. it is my sons room and really works great.,5
"I am very happy with this affordable wall mount for my Sony 32"" Internet TV. One nice feature ist that you can swivel the mounted TV depending on where you are seated.",5
"I have a 26"" LCD monitor mounted on unit.Seems sturdy enough, would prefer a more fluid motion and a way to adjust the pivot of the screen without tools.  As it is I keep it loose and it is reasonbly adjustable.For the price I certanily can't complain and would recommend this unit.",4
"Easy to install, and works great. Television moves with ease and always feels secure. Doesn't loosen over time like other television mounts.",5
This was for a 32 inch LCD.  Easy to install and works great.  I am very satisfied with this wall mount.,5
"Fits many different size TV's,  is very solid, and was easy to install.  I would recommend to anyone is even slightly handy.",4
"I'm using this with my 32"" tv and I love it. The price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores (walmart, best buy).I found this to be an easy install and very secure. The swivel is smooth and I can orient my television perfectly. It also has plenty of VESA mount patterns so it will hold just about any TV.",5
"For such a cheap mount, it works well. I installed in in about 20 minuets and use it to hole a 32"" Vizio LED.",5
"This was a present for myself, my son installed it, in about 25 minutes, and I couldn't be happier.  I wasn't sure this was for me as it for my bedroom, but my husband and I love it.  So easy to move the TV no matter where you are in the room.  A great buy.",5
Mounting the TV after mounting on wall can be a handful.  It would have been nice to have some type of slide in mount for the TV so you did not have to hold it while putting in 4 screws.  That would make DIY one person installation easier.,5
"When we first bought our bedroom tv, we looked at the mounts in the store and almost fell over from shock at the prices.  This is one of the best prices I have found on mounts.  This mount went up easy and moves in all directions to get the perfect viewing angle.  it comes with everything you need but the drill and tv!  You won't be disappointed with this brand.",5
"If I need to order another, this will be the one.  I used this to mount a TV to the wall in my basement and it allows me to pull the tv out from the wall and turn it towards my desk so I can watch TV while working on the PC, nearly a 90 degree angle.  My TV is only a 32&#34; and I could see that this would work up to a 40&#34; or so, but if you don't need to turn the TV 90 degrees, you could get by with a larger TV.",5
"I was hesitant about mounting my larger flat screen (47&#34; LG) onto the wall - what happens if it falls off!  After looking at mounts at Target and Best Buy that were $100+, would this possibly work?Fast forward...  The mount took about 20 minutes to install (too longer to locate the studs than mount it).  The TV is on the wall and works wonderfully.  Very solid mount and good articulation.My only comments are the cord clips included are very weak.  I will be replacing them with black cable ties.  Also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the TV on the articulating mount - I can wiggle my screen (tilt) by about 1/4&#34; since there is only a screw on the bottom.Overall, I liked the narrow wall mount and the 20&#34; extension.  Definitely would recommend for a TV that is 47&#34;.",5
"Easy to install, with extra hardware for installing your TV. However, my TV had a curved back, so I used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the TV. I was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall, so I added two 5/16&#34; lags, under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting brackets.After installing the Swing Arm wall mount, I grabbed the end of the bracket, fully extended. The bracket didn't sag a bit. I concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficient.I've swung my TV out and exercised the various angles available, and found the swing arm not giving a millimeter.I fully recommend this wall mount. I've a few other VideoSecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an 80-inch Sharp TV. All are quality products.",5
"The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out.  there is no adjustment for it, so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall, or when it was out.  i do not recommend this wall mount.to it's benefit though, it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install.",2
"Purchased for my sister to hang her TV on a wall and she and her boyfriend reported back to me that mount works great with the 42&#34; Vizio TV she got for Christmas and was up securely in no time.  I looked around in the retail stores and found that this mount was of similar quality at a much lower price.  What can I say, it does what it is supposed to do, was easy to setup, and is of good value.",5
"This was needed to mount a 32"" LCD that weighs 27 lbs in my bedroom. I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32"" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one. If you find yourself reading reviews on TV mounts and you have found this one your search is over, just click buy already.",5
This is mounted in a doorway between two rooms in my basement with a 40 inch TV attached to it.  I can move it to either room and still keep the doorway open plenty wide enough to pass through.  Perfect for my needs.,5
"Sturdy and durable craftsmanship. Bought for my grandma in Mexico, had it installed and works great. Has awesome mobility to enjoy your television from countless angles in your room.",5
If you want a wall mount that is universal and can be moved in all directions this is the one to get.  My 42&#34; Samsung 3D tv mounted easily and the extensions were not required.  I mounted it to a stud and it seems to be very secure.  I am able to swing the tv to watch from my bed or from the lazyboy chair without a problem.,5
"Great wall mount at a great price.  Already fully assembled out of the box and seems built to last.  I really like the swivel and tilt as we need it when laying down in the bedroom.  Easy instructions (I'm not a carpenter).  I used this on a 32"" Samsung LED TV.",5
"Very simple set up and ease of installation. I followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the top hex-screw of one of the center connections (thus disconnecting the wall plate from the plate attached to the TV)so that I could install the plate to the wall and the plate to the back of the TV as separate processes. Both simple and quite easy. Then it was simply a matter of slipping the two back together and re-installing the hex-screw. I was able to install a 32"" RCA TV, without any help in less than 20 minutes.Manufacturer provided a good assortment of screws and other hardware, as well as a hex wrench, a small open wrench and a level.",4
"got this to hang a 32"" sony lcd in my bedroom.  used my stud finder to locate the studs, drilled 6 pilot holes and hung it up.  and extra set of hands is helpful when hanging the mount and mounting the tv.  holes on mount lined up perfectly with my tv.  screws fit just right.no complaints.",5
used it for vizio 42&#34; tv. easy to install. fit perfectly. what is there else to say? strongly recommend for everyone.,5
"I purchased this mount for my 37 inch LCD TV.  Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.  Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.Overall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.  I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most.",3
"I thought this was a great value for a wall mount.  I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.  It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket.  Is it the best quality ever, no.  It is decent quality, and it worked well for me.",4
my tv! Couldn't ask for more. Thanks. These reviews require too many words. I could have said what I meant in three.,5
"This TV mount is easy to install.  Just follow the directions included.  I installed this near the ceiling and I'm using every bit of the 15 degree downward tilt.  Properly installed, the product is rock solid.  I installed a 32"" tv on it.  I know it can hold much more.  The articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that, too.",5
"This is the second VideoSecu product I have ordered. They are rock-solid, and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package, it's hard to imagine any speaker or TV that these systems won't fit.",5
"For the price it can't be beat.  The mount is strong and sturdy.  Two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting, three would be ideal.  Once up though, it's better than most of our friends mounts.  It has full articulation, and I can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen.  This is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games.",5
"I originally bought this for a Sony 40&#34; TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42&#34; instead.  I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).  If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount.",5
I am using this with a 40 inch Samsung smart tv.  The extended bars were not needed.  This is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts.  Many bolts are provided to fit with your television.  It is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways.  Highly recommended.,5
"This mount is heavy, strong and already in one piece. Almost no directions were needed. The only issue I would have: After the mount is installed I had to lift the TV to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the TV up with one hand. I checked the instructions to make sure I wasn't being stupid. The directions confirmed to lift the TV and screw in the screws. Other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and TV, then I just lift the TV and click it right in. The sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinion.",5
"This mount is sturdy, easy to install, and easy to mount the TV to.  The included hardware was heavy duty also.  The action is good, and tension is adjustable.  The tilt can be adjusted by using the knob in lieu of one of the bolts, or locked in place (which makes it more difficult for someone to remove the TV unless they have a wrench with).  I mounted the 27"" TV on our lanai, so a little theft-proofing is a good thing.  The TV is now visible either on the lanai, or from the patio.I RECENTLY BOUGHT A SECOND ONE, AND THEY HAVE CHANGED.  STILL STURDY, BUT LACKING THE QUICK MOUNT FEATURE! NOW YOU MUST HOLD THE TV IN PLACE WHILE INSERTING THE TINY SCREWS THROUGH THE BACK.",5
"Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.",5
I purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance. The problem with wall mounting flat screen TV's is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the TV you buy. I'm using this mount with a VIZIO E320ME 32-inch and it works perfect.,5
"I'm using this to mount an older SyncMaster 191T above my desk and was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is for the price.  Installation was simple, though I used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment, as none of those included would work with my monitor.  The tilt mechanism requires loosening a bolt and then adjusting the monitor to the desired angle.  I would have preferred another 10-15 degrees of vertical tilting capability, but what is available will be fine for most applications.  I posted a couple of photos that shows it mounted.Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and would buy again should I need to mount another small display.",4
"Its sturdy, holds my tv really good, its adjustable & really really easy to install. An excellent product. I would definitely recommend it.",5
"I got this for mounting a tv on the wall in my home office. Price was good and it worked. The adjustments on it work well, and it has a gizmo to hold the cables in place. Don't hesitate to buy. I think I am using this with a 38&#34; tv.",5
It does the job and it wasn't too hard to install so i'm a happy tv viewer. Nothing bad to say about it. Came with a bunch of bolt options for different make and model TV's,5
I have this wall mount installed outside. I have a 32&#34; hanging on it in my backyard. Easy to install and have had no problems what so ever..,5
"We had to &#34;shave&#34; a little off the wall mount plate to get this product to work for us, but after doing so it has served it's purpose on our 24&#34; tv.",3
This unit has worked perfectly in holding a 40&#34; TV in an extended position for months - without sagging or failing.  Very happy with the purchase,5
"Unfortunately, I'm returning this mount.Though I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn't well made.I purchased it to mount aLG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTVin our kitchen.The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.",2
"I must admit, I'm very cautious of what I buy especially when I've seen this identical bracket in the electronic stores priced three to four times than this one.  Bracket arrived much faster then what Amazon estimated and was well packaged.  The directions were adequate but I'm very mechanically inclined so used them as a quick guide and had this bracket installed with my Sony 37"" LCD in under a half hour.  My hats off to the marketing folks with this manufacturer as they did their homework and included additional hardware and brackets to meet any possible configuration out there.  Including mounting tools and level were also an exceptional idea.  And tossing in a 7' HDMI cable was the icing on the cake.",5
"If less money had been spent on packaging and more on quality, it might be a good product.The product was double-boxed.  The included level was broken. I would prefer to use my own level and have good hardware instead of junk on both counts.  One of the pivots on the arm was so badly rusted out of the box it seemed to compromise the whole system.  Despite 6 huge lag screws and strong arms, the joints are not strong enough to keep the mount level as it extends and articulates.  Each time I moved it it had to be re-adjusted to be level.  The hardware had to be tightened so much to keep it from wobbling, it made moving it very difficult.  I used a 26"" tv.The whole thing went back in the box for a refund.",1
I bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the TV based on our viewing angle.  In order to move it I had to loosed the screws each and every time.  I had it connected to a 27in vizio LCD which is pretty light.  Could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it.  Had to return,1
"Worked great. Easy mounting and setup. 2007 Vizio 42&#34; LCD hung perfectly. It is a heavier TV, around 50lbs and it mounted up great.",5
"received the product and got it installed today. for the most part I am pretty happy with the hardware except the materials being used to make screws or other parts. the screws get very easily damaged by the most commonly used screw drivers that you can find for $1 per piece.  Once I put the bolt into the LCD TV and mount it with the plate, I found myself having a hardtime removing the screw because the tread mark on the screw head is already messed by by the screw driver, which makes me doubt about the material being used on the mount and arms.  is the material used on the mount going to deliver the same quality as the bolts and nuts?",3
"Mounting a 42 inch LG TV weighing 33 poundsPROLess expensivePrevious purchase of VideoSecu productAppeared solid and strongHad tilt and various adjustmentsMount on single studCONSagging..this is amazing that it sags and does so at different angles based on how far the TV is pulled out from the wallTherefore one cannot keep the TV properly aligned because any movement changes the tilt or other angles.Mounting is a pain because the mounting bracket never comes apart from the articulation armCritical bolt attachment for the mount from the TV to the articulation arm does not get tight!  This is amazing. It is not stripped but it does will not stay tight even from the first use.  This makes the product unsafe.I am amazingly frustrated bordering on angry because of the time put into this and now holes in the wall.  I need to get a different one.  My prior experience was with a VideoSecu MW380B TV wall articulating mount, which is far superior for a larger TV.  I bought this other one because I wanted a tight fit to the wall.Can I send a bill for my time and work putting it up and taking it down?????",1
"The Nook Tablet, in both the 16gb version and 8 gb version, are the best color e-readers of 2012.  Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a ""Brand X"" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as ""Automobile"" or ""National Geographic"".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines ""pop"" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special ""text only"" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook ""shop"" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get ""right"", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the ""book world"" and the ""video world"". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a ""book of the day"" for adults and a ""book of the day"" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was ""Mary Poppins"", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.",5
"I saw this product on Amazon and thought ""what a great deal"" because this is a 16GB version of the same tablet that Barnes & Noble is selling for $250 dollars.It mostly works, and the screen is great for reading books.  I have had problems with the browser since 2 weeks of owning and the Apps have issues loading and playing some games.  If I could, I would return this product and just pay out the money for a brand new one.",3
"Now I have like four different kendels and I am such a Fan.  My darling Daughter n law requested this.  No way, says I.  Then I see these reconditioned ones with a warranty, cases n protective films, new chargers and 16 gb HD.  Had to get it or her.  Only cause she gave me the worlds best gran babies ...and I guess I love her like mad too.",5
"this is excellent tablet, excellent touch screen response and button controls. When you hold it in your hand, you will feel that its built tough and can withstand rough handling(my 17m old tosses it sometimes out of excitement and its still holding good). Battery is also good, last about 8+ hours; the old drawback is that there are very limited apps on Noon web, but I heard there's a way to sideload adds from Amazon that I haven't tried yet. But yes, I would highly recommend it.",5
"I love nooks. Kindle fire is OK, but nooks are easy to root and install cyanogen mod foe a full android experience.",5
"Have no idea why people love this thing so much, you can't load any applications unless they are from the Barnes & Noble store and you can't even download the free version of Angry Birds.Apparently Barnes & Noble is worse than Apple at remotely disabling Nooks they deemed rooted by end users. You have less control of this thing than you would your TV.The root kits are useless for this OS version 1.4.2 and the instructions to root / jailbreak it read worse than rocket instructions from annoying geeks !It is an overpriced Barnes & Noble franchise in your dumb little hands and you're well served keeping your receipt and refunding it.",1
"I bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in BN and seeing how amazingly responsive it is. I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more ""manly"" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!",5
"When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.",3
"this is such a great tablet. one time didn't work. acted weird really weird. needed to be cleaned. now I keep eyeglass cleaning clothes (disposable) for it. has worked like a charm since. hooks up to the computer without the shelves going away. book reading is great too. I use it for an ereader with games that I sometimes play, but mostly as an ereader. recommended.",5
Great product  works just as described have had no problems with it since I got it thanks for a great product,5
"I do not understand people, they are comparing this $100 tablet with $500 Ipad, of course it is not gonna be the same. I would recommend this tablet to everyone especially for the kids.",5
"Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, ""Wow! it's as good as the Sony!""  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not ""locations"" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.",5
"You would be crazy to buy here... its cheaper anywhere else.  UPDATE  I see amazon is now selling at the same price as the rest of the world so I retract...Also discovered another negative... When browsing the web the nook works fine on all sites EXCEPT AMAZON, now fancy that.  It will stay on amazon about 30 seconds then pop back to where ever I was before web browsing.  I've tried it over and over does it every time.Thanks to all who commented about the ability to still root the nook.  it is more complicated now but doable.  I'm debating about giving it a try.  Updated 1/22/12There are things to like about the nook, BUTNo android marketB&N; wants your credit card to download FREE apps -  ain't gonna happenstuff that is free on Android Market cost money at the B&N; app store.  I.E. Angry Birds costs 2.99 but is free from Android Market.I bought this Nook because it was root-able... but no longer with the latest update B&N; blocks attempt to root the device.BOO HISS ON B&N.;I never buy anything Apple because of the closed system.  I totally believe in Open architecture for electronic devices.  The closed system ONLY benefits the seller not the user.If all you want is a reader, email and the web.  then hey go for it.  but I truly disappointed and may return it.",2
"I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful. My children love it.",5
"I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual ""we got your request and will reply as soon as possible"" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally ""side loaded"" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to ""root"" products like these (especially since they aren't ""mine,"" as I won't be the one using them).  As the ""guy,"" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big ""n"" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the ""tablet"" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the ""expert"" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.",2
"I went to a few places just to try testing them out, best place to test them out first hand was BN. The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.",4
"And what is it? Why it's an outdated B&N; Tablet! A friend of mine purchased this after seeing my 9in HD+ tablet, but wanted the smaller 7in version. It works fine for what it is, but it caused her much confusion as it did not seem ""as nice"" to her as my 9in concerning screen quality.And that's because this is not the NEW Nook HD with a 1440X900 screen resolution and upgraded hardware, firmware, and software which has been on sale everywhere since the B&N; Father's Day Sale was extended indefinitely. This is the OLD Nook color with a standard 1024X768 resolution screen and minus the upgraded hardware and OS.IOW this is the old model :)So if looking for that ""new, on sale"" tablet by B&N; like my friend was, well, this ain't it. She will be returning hers and getting what she wanted initially.As for this one it looks fine and works fine for what it was, but comes up short these days, period.",3
"The nook tablet is great.I have used it to check e-mail,browse and look at books,and also transferred one from my p.c.I like the way it will sync with the direction its rotated,and I love the touch screen.Thanks Amazon!",5
Check your SN with Barnes & Noble's 800 number. Mine was used from BuyAccessories. I paid $70 too much as used is under $30 these days.,1
"I read all the reviews and decided to buy this Barnes and Noble Nook for my Grandson for Christmas it was used but with original box and accesories  through EZ CORPS!!!  And I'm happy to say this Barnes and Noble is the best I ever invested in the picture and color is beautiful. Let's put it this way my niece that has the kindle was checking out the Barnes and Noble nook and compared it to her kindle said that the Barnes and Noble Nook has a clear picture than her kindle and more apps!!! And I told her I did my homework and looked this Nook up and it had the best reputation as far as for a kid,Young teen, Best nook ever invested in money and used at that but I will only order used if the item says like New with original Box with Accesories . And  I will only order anything used through EZ CORPS!! Best company to ever order anything from on Amazon fast professional customer service and love there shipping and handling !! And there all there used products are tested before selling which is a plus. I would Highly recommend this company any day to any one , Friends,Family,etc,Yes this Barnes & Noble Nook is well worth ordering used or new. Thank you Kristen Cates.",5
"I could not be more pleased with - or impressed by - the Nook Tablet! I know that Amazon is ""enemy territory"", but the NT does a much better job of meeting my needs than would a Kindle Fire.Not only can I use my NetFlix account but I also have full access to the Amazon Prime website to watch films and videos!The screen is incredible - bright and colorful and very fast due to both the fast processor and the full Gig of RAM. I popped-in a 16G micro SDHC card and have more than enough room for my entire library of sideloaded epubs, pdfs, mp3s, and mp4 videos.And, of course, the primary use: It's now much easier to read in bed at night. The backlit screen means no more glare from an external reading light.",5
"I have tried the IPad, the Kindle, and the Sony, and nothing has worked better than this Nook Tablet. It's light, the screen resolution is amazing for movies, and the applications I use work beautifully. Even the speakers are excellent for what they are. No complaints at all.",5
"Nice specs with nice screen. Not worth the price with just the stock operating system, might as well save the bucks and buy the cheaper color model. You cannot use the larger 16gb internal memory to load your own files as the bad boys at B&N; restricts your access to only 1gb of that memory. UPDATE: Because of the unhappy owners B&N; will relax this restriction when you take the unit into their store and reserved space will be changed so you get 8gb free space.As is, the unit is SEVERELY crippled from making full use of its outstanding specs. Turn this baby into a great Android tablet by ""rooting"" it - easily and painlessly done by buying one of those SD card based kits. I got a 32 GB card with the root kit and I now have full access to Android apps with the ability to revert back to stock is if desired. You can now get all these capabilities on a really good performing tablet for well under $130 (like new used) but remember you get a unit that's a generation old and doesn't have bluetooth, gps, and hdmi out like most other newer tablets have.",5
"If all you want is a tablet for reading B&N; books and periodicals and maybe playing the occasional cheesy game, this is for you.  Otherwise, pass.This is listed as an Android tablet but it's not.  It's Android on the surface but it can't access Google Play and instead uses the B&N; app store.  This means paying for apps that are free elsewhere.Also, my unit takes an incredibly slow 2 minutes to boot, drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a 90s drug store computer.Wonder where the camera is?  It's at the factory -- there isn't one.  Forget Skype or face to face video chatting.Spend your $200 on a real tablet.By the way, not a slap at Amazon, just the tablet itself.",1
"This thing has been through so much. Closed in doors, thrown across the room, been the object of desire in a toddler tug of war and it still keep working. It i just fantastic! To any one complaining that he app store for barns and noble is too small I say just sideload google play with the root kit. It is easy and doecker skills to do.",5
"I'm happy, satisfied and proud of myself by selecting such a wonderful tablet like my NOOK.  Honestly it worths more than a five star rating.I will recall a phrase in a movie, it came to a certain point when I had to decide between style and substance...That's right! I got both on this Tablet.The product arrived two weeks ago, I did charge the battery and afterwards registreded the product so I immediately starting getting books, nowadays I have plenty of Nook Books to read ahead.My co-workers and friends love the aesthetics of the Nook look, as I love all the features in the device.Pros: All of them.- The screen is so clear (""Wows!"" me all the time), fast response to tasks, easy menu, fast processor, Micro SD card slot added 32GB extra fun (big smile), lightweight, long life battery. etc.Cons: None",5
"The Nook Tablet is a solid hybrid tablet/eBook reader.  It excels at eBook reading, and has many functions as a tablet as well.  This is a minor upgrade for Nook Color owners, but a major upgrade for those going from the Nook or Kindle eInk display reader.Pros:7"" VividView IPS touchscreen, bonded for glare reduction.  This is the best IPS screen on the market in this class of device.MicroSD card slot, for up to 32GB of extra storage.Built-in Microphone for voice recording, particularly usefull to ""read"" books to your children without having to physically be there.Reliable Wifi card.1 GB built in RAM for smooth, fast video.Netflix and Hulu.eReader bests the competitions.Easy to root, if that is something you would do.Cons:It's $50 more than some low end hybrids.Much like the other low end tablet's, it runs on Android, which is not the best tablet experience.Limited apps, although the list expands almost daily.Overall, this is a great device and although it is $50 more than some of the competitors models, it is also a far more refined product which doesn't have many of the problems of the others.Highly recommended!",5
the nook color is a great tablet. it sometimes is very slow but it is still a good tablet. i have dropped it a few times and it is still okay.,5
"For the price this is a great tablet. It lacks a camera, GPS, and bluetooth, but that still leaves a lot, between web browsing and running lots of Android apps. Barnes and Noble did cripple these with limited software through their store but I did get around that by rooting mine.That said, I was sort of surprised to see this pop up as something recommended by Amazon today. The newer version is faster, has a higher resolution screen, is lighter despite same screen size, and has bluetooth. (Still no camera or GPS). B&N; also is now allowing access to the Google Play Store. It is available on the newer version but I don't know if they updated the software for this one to allow access. I suspect they didn't but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing.If you want a tablet for web browsing, checking email, ebooks, video, and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend, then it isn't a bad deal. I would recommend paying more for the newer version--the Nook HD. (They also make a version with a larger screen, the HD+)Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet. I wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet (but rooting is more work than inserting a card). The HD works well off a rooted Jelly Bean card.",4
"I have used several different 7 inch tablets. The best I used was the Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus. This is a less expensive tablet and very, very good. But rooting the Nook Tablet made it great.That is a fairly easy thing to do with a bit of patience and reading. There are step-by-step videos on how to do this and links to necessary files. All you need to get you started is Google ""root Nook Tablet"". Yes, when it is rooted it does void the Nook Tablet warranty, but it can be unrooted without problems.The screen is beautiful, it is fast and with the micro SD card slot, has plenty of room for storage. I bought my 16gb for $229. A great tablet for the price and I use it every day. Great purchase.The Galaxy Tabs are noted for audio quality and, of course, have some features that can be useful. But the Nook Tablet is mighty fine and a great investment for the price.",5
"The customer support people at Barnes & Noble site are clueless. They are useless for providing help. If you buy tablet, you are on your own. In the store it is the same.",1
"If you want an e-reader, get an e-reader - the battery dies in a few hours (or a couple, depending on brightness settings). If you want a tablet, get a tablet. There are far better options for a similar price. If all you want to do is read magazines and buy a few apps, fine. But this thing is truly lacking. I've owned mine for 6 months, and haven't changed my mind about it yet.UPDATE: The product gets even worse with age. It will not fully charge, ever, and at 15% it goes crazy. It runs all sorts of apps, closes them, types things into the browser, and won't let you use the tablet at all. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is unacceptable. 15% should still be enough to read for a bit, rather than going psycho and taking over the device.",1
"Just picked up a refurbished Nook Tablet from newegg's website and its amazing. Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion. Matter of fact I am writing this review on my iPad and shortly I will go back to reading on my Nook Tablet.",5
I love using this. It's light and easy and fast! LOVE that is has hte capability of Google Play on it! So hard to find things that are compatible,5
my wife was tired of dragging books around she loves the covienence of the tablet and can make the text larger,5
"I was looking at expensive tablets that were more like mini notebook computers. I already have a high end notebook. I wanted something that was very portable and not combersome to take on trips, go to coffee shops and etc. I wanted the ability to get email, do limited surfing and read books. The Nook works flawlessly and the display is really nice. I have an N protocol router and the Nook is quick on the Net. I read some negative reviews here. They appear to be written by folks who want to take a $200 unit and turn it into a $500 unit with various apps and other applications. Here's a news flash for the naysayers. Go out and buy the $500 unit and quit complaining. If you want to read books, surf and get email, you'll like this unit.",5
"Update 2-Sep-13:Put on CM 10.2.2 (Android 4.2.2) last week.  I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N;-  Browse the web on a tablet-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:-  Buy a full selection of games/apps-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.-  Play mpeg videos-  Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7"" Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased; content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like ""&lt;"", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7"" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.",1
"I own the original Nook e-ink reader and the Nook tablet.  I have been happy with both.  When I read all the wonderful reviews about the Nook HD+ I couldn't wait to buy one.  The main reason that I bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where I need at least 16 point type.  The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome.  I use the tablet, not only for reading, but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike.  The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However, there are several problems with the current edition:There needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end.  I had to choose between too small and too large.The sound level was too low, even with headphones.  I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume.  There are a number of third-party applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.So, in spite of the beautiful display, I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store.  When planning future upgrades.  I would advise Barnes & Noble to consider the needs of older customers and people with disabilities.  We are not an insignificant market segment.",3
"Rooted, and cyanogenmod installed, works awesome.  The Nook Tablet has a bit more memory than the original Nook Color, so that's why I got this one.",5
"The B&N Nook is a great device. The hardware in it makes sure there is no lag or waits while watching videos, reading books, or surfing the web. The builtin apps are great, as well as the overall layout and options. The major drawback is the inability to load 3rd party apps...but roll back to firmware 1.4.0 and load all you want before upgrading. Or root it (although Amazon Instant Video will not work after rooting).",5
It accepts up to 32gb micro sd cards but does not work properly with a 32gb card. Mine would not boot because the card used too much energy. That was the only issue I had. Customer service told me to unplug the card before booting up and then insert the card. I returned it and purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus.Funny thing is Barnes and Noble rrjected my review.,2
"Let's just say this will never be iPad or anywhere close to it. That said, it is never meant to compete with iPad anyway! IF you compare this with Amazon's Fire, it's a closer comparison. Frankly, this is better than Fire. Hands down, NT has better hardware specs and it shows when you start browsing internet with heavy imagery or picture ebooks or emags. The complaints about NT's wall-garden OS restriction is very true...so is Amazon's Fire!It's not the end of the world, just root the device and you have in hand a functional tablet for $250 that is rather spiffy. This doesn't get a 5-star rate because 7-inch form factor is the biggest drawback compare to the OS lockdown. Personally, 7-in tablets is too small for serious computing usage. It is a good reading form factor though. I can't give this a 4-star rate because B&N;'s app store is too small...even when rooted, Google's Market Place is filled with crappy-junk apps.",3
"i got a 16gb microsd off of amazon for under $14.00 and it holds just little over 8k books, it was what swayed be over the kindle fire, that and the 1gb of ram vs 512mb. Now that they released a 8gb nook for $199.00 its price point is on par with the fire, and has the option of expansion, and  a simple hack allows for a custom android launcher, and i can easily install the amazon app store(and kindle app), android market place, and have a very decent wifi tablet, tbh i wasn't much of a analog book reader, but with this little nook tablet i've been averaging a book a week, along with .99-1.99 monthly magazine subscriptions.when the original nook first came out i purchased one and took it back 2hrs later, it was less then what i expected, but i think barnes and noble has come a long way and now this version is very impressive.battery life is decent, depending on your screen brightness preference and netflix usage, unless i am at home, i usually have the screen brightness at little less then half, and wifi off, and get about 6-9hrs of nonstop read time, 3 days of casual reading/standby.",5
"Great Product, Great Sale, I love this Product, and my children will too I cant wait til Christmas to Give them their present.",5
"The Nook HD was designed to be a book reader, although it also is a great way to watch videos on Netflix, or listen to Pandora Radio, or to your favorite music. I added a 32gb memory card so that I can have thousands of my favorite songs with me when I travel.The Nook HD has a screen with the best resolution and the least glare and reflection of any color e-reader.  It is the only color e-reader that comes close to the reading experience of an e-ink reader.Barnes & Noble has lots of children's books that take advantage of the Nook's color and audio features.  I bought a Christmas story that can read out loud in English or Spanish, and on each page something would be moving...snow falling, or the moon moving across the sky.The Nook is VERY light, which makes it easy to read for hours, and you don't mind having your Nook with you 24/7 in your purse or ""man purse"" (I use a small laptop bag).The Barnes & Noble selection of e-books is huge, and includes 90% of best sellers.  Each day, there is a ""Book of the Day"" for $2 or $3...many of them best-sellers or classic books.",5
"I've owned an Ipad 2, an original Kindle Fire, and first generation 3g dual screen Nook. I decided it was time to upgrade my original Nook and went with this tablet. I purchased mine direct from B&N. This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7"" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N's Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better. It would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with. All in all, the Nook HD is a great device that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, and is worth serious consideration.",5
"I got this for my little girl, as she filled up her 8gb tablet with games. We just love the Nook HD tablets. The fact they have Google Play, and you can change the background to a nice picture, makes these tablets superior in most ways, to the Kindle Fire. Yes, the Fires have their own advantages (we have some) but overall, we prefer the Nook HDs.",5
"I tried Kindle hd, Samsung tab 2, and Nexus 7. I returned them all since I had high standard for display quality of tablets. I was very disappointed by their color faithfulness and/or resolution.One day I saw a hot discussion online about discounted nook hd from Staples. I rushed to a local store and played nook hd. Its screen immediately attracted me: bright, white, colorful, high resolution. This is what I want!I have being enjoying nook hd ever since. It has THE BEST SCREEN  period!Online community like XDA forum has ways to root nook hd and install Android by yourself. I rooted mine and can enjoy all apps from Google play store.Even today, I still wow when I read text, view photo, and watch videos on nook hd.",4
"not so happy with it. I have had my Nook HD for approximately 7 months. During that time, I have ordered 60 books, of which I have read 50. Those read were placed in created Shelf A or Shelf C, depending on whether I liked it or not. Everything was working fine until they did a recent update and then it was like a tornado was let in. Locked up my Nook until I downloaded the update and then found all my shelves gone and books missing from my library. Called BN-shelves gone and will have to create again plus move read books back into and missing books from library have to be downloaded again. One book was not found and after an hour on the phone, BN said the publisher stopped making it available for the Nook (is available for the Kindle) and will issue a refund. Fortunately I kept the email confirmations of all books I ordered so I could give them the order number.Customer service is lacking at BN. I had to make multiple calls until I was finally put in touch with someone who could solve the problem of the missing book.One other thing-update seems to have changed screen brightness as before I could read it out by the pool and now I no longer can.In fairness, I will also mention that I have a Kindle paperwhite and an update wiped out my created collections, but didn't lose any books and can still read it out by the pool.Both have Wi-Fi and that may be an inherent problem with updating through it as far as shelves/collections go.",3
"The Nook HD is my third Nook device. I like the Nook simple Touch, Nook Tablet because I primarily use it to read books, watch an occasional video (YouTube), listen to music on Pandora, and work a cross-word puzzle or play a game. Because I enjoyed my Nook so much, I decided to purchase the Nook HD because it is much lighter in weight and more compact in size. Now that I have purchased the Nook HD I have some pros and cons about the product. Nothing serious, I will give myself a little more time to get used to it. But I am concerned about the short battery life.Pros: Light weight and smaller than the previous tablet; great video picture quality and the sound is very good even without the earbuds.Cons: I have to get used to the new interface, the previous tablet was easier to use and navigate; when playing games and connecting to the web using wi-fi, I have to charge frequently because it uses up the battery very quickly&#8212;I may have to carry my charger with me; not as many fonts to choose from like the previous tablet.Overall, I am pleased with my Nook HD Tablet. Once I have resolved some of the cons with this product, I will be a little more comfortable with using it on a daily basis.",4
"It has everything you need in a tablet, except it doesn't have a camera, 3G or GPS, personally I don't need them. But guess what... It is built in microphone.. That is good, I like to sing.O.k. this tablet has a good touch response, you can touch even the smallest links, the screen is extremely crisp and beautiful 900X1440 pixel the highest resolution in the 7 inch tablets!... I was amazed at how beautiful google maps is displayed, I loved it. It has a dual-core 1.3 ghz processor and 1 Gb of Ram, it is quick and very responsive but don't abuse, it is only a tablet.I decided to get this tablet instead of the Asus Nexus 7 because it is lighter, it only weights 11 Oz, this is a good factor if you are planning to use it for long periods of time. I use it for reading colored magazines and illustrative books. Besides it is easy to grip.The battery last about 11 hours if you use it only for reading, and about 7 hrs if you watch videos or use it in wi-fi mode.The new software updates give you access to google Play. It couldn't be easier. You don't deal with any annoying promos and the charger and wire is included.",5
"Bought a 16 GB one at my local B&N; store, on sale at $119. Fantastic! It is totally Android, hooked right into the Googleplex... like Google Maps, and the Google Play apps store... where, you guessed it, I immediately downloaded the free 'must-have' Amazon Kindle app, perfect! (I might buy the B&N; tablet, but books? Amazon all the way). And free Acrobat Reader, which will still enlarge any vector line art in a PDF to 6400%, just like on a PC/Mac. Note -- Flash and video embedded in a PDF do not play on the Nook, or, to my knowledge, on any other tablet, or on Macs.Let's see. Photos (originals are 1800 x 1200) shown from my Smugmug site are razor-sharp in perfect color on the 7"" Nook screen. I'm an amateur photographer, and it's a joy to see my images displayed absolutely correctly.Other stuff -- it has a microSD card slot so you can bring in your own pix, docs, PDFs, etc. Will buy a microSD card for it tomorrow. As an aside, there's a company called N2acards that sells a microSD card pre-loaded with the Android operating system... but, with the Nook HD 'in bed' with Google, I'm not sure what I'm missing by just sticking with the Nook's built-in system.Anyway, I'm VERY happy with this product. If it blows up, I can take it back to my local B&N; store and get another. And it has a feature where it backs up all your content on Google servers.Lastly, was able to connect it to my Yahoo e-mail account immediately. It also has Facebook and Twitter, but I turned them off as I'm fairly anti-social.",5
"Had some initial problems, sound output was so low that I could not hear it.  Tech support said to de-register it and reboot.  That cured that problem.  Then WIFI would disconnect without any apparent cause.  Called tech support 3 times, they were helpful and courteous, but we could not solve that problem.  Finally tech support asked me if I had inserted a miniSD card, I had.  They told me to check to see if that it was corrupted, it was.  Re-formatting that card solved WIFI problem, although just why it was causing this problem is still a mystery to me.  If you have problems with your NOOK, and you are not able to solve them, and you have inserted a MiniSD card, try re-formatting it.I have an Apple IPAD, I bought the NOOK to help me learn and understand ANDROID.  I find ANDROID substantially less user friendly, and the apps cost more and do not work as well.  More importantly, at least to me, is the fact that there are at least a  dozen  apps that I use all the time that have no equivalent in ANDROID.  In short, I will not be buying an android phone to replace my IPHONE anytime soon.",4
"I bought the hd first and am completely in love with it. A very handy size and very responsive. Bought the hd+ for use when size is not a factor. Love both. Added 64 gig scandisk to both. Only real issue is that I run ubuntu, no windows/mac, so had to cobble my desktop and laptop to ba able to download to nook. Can set video downloads to default to sd card. Very happy. Thinking about buying one more of each if the price goes even lower, for backups in case of loss or damage.",5
I bought the Nook primarily for reading but wanted the HD for email and web browsing also. I was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional screen quality and ease of setup.I did not want to spend the money for an IPAD and now I am glad I didn't as I prefer the Nook interface for reading. The screen brightness can be changed anytime during reading but on the IPAD you have to go into settings after exiting the book you are reading. The only downside is there are not as many apps written for the Nook. I am hoping that will change.,5
"With all the tablets and apps out we don't really need EReaders anymore.  I am not exactly sure why I wanted a e reader.  I mean,  I have a iPod, iPad, Kindle, Regular Nook,  iPad Mini,  iPhone, Blackberry Playbook.I decided to sell my Kindle Fire and my previous Color nook tablet and upgrade to the snow nook HD and its beautiful,  it also has google apps on here now so we can get a lot of android apps, including the AHEM// Kindle app.I like the nook friends and borrowing books options as well as how clean the OS is.",5
,5
"If you are looking for a very light and compact device to read your books, check your e-mail and watch movies, you really can't beat the Nook HD. It has the highest screen resolution for its form factor (7"") and is a pleasure to read and write with. Netflix & Hulu+ are magical to view since the resolution is so high and it's so darn light. Being able to expand the memory with a micro SD card is just another plus. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with it an would recommend it highly!",5
"Why pay to be restricted, I simply didn't see the benefit with all of the other tablets out there having apps that perform exactly the same tasks. Just decided to go a cheaper route and I am so glad I did.Maybe I would consider the Nook again if it is expanded beyond a e-reader.",1
We have both the hd and the hd+ but I love the hd because it is lightweight and very portable. All my nooks are converted to android and work very well.,5
"It is too bad that the Nook HD hasn't received more kudos. To be honest, I knew it had a great screen, a fast proce fast processor, great battery life, and oh so light and easy to handle. But, I did wait for a means for rooting the Nook HD to become available. Now the tablet lives up to all its potential. Rooting is quite easy and it is a great tablet",5
"This is a really nice item. With the way I use it, the battery life lasts for several days of reading and browsing the web. Magazines on this screen are amazing, I especially like reading Time because of the outstanding photography they do. Books look great, and the selection of games on the Barnes and Noble store is alright. A little annoying paying again for games I already bought on my phone, but that's not so bad.Further, you really don't need to pay again for games if you install a custom ROM on an SD card. You can either purchase one premade (google for N2A for more info) or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things. It's not scary at all, especially since you're only doing stuff on the SD card not the tablet itself. If you want to undo it, just take the card out! Anyway, the custom ROM just gets you stock android, and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps. You can still read all your Barnes and Noble stuff on the B&N; android app. I read my Wired subscription that way, as well as some books. Anyway, I think this device and the ROM on the SD card is the best of B&N; and android.Anyway, I'd compare this with the Google Nexus 7. The nook has a slightly higher resolution screen, which is kinda neat especially for magazines. No front facing camera on the nook, but my phone already is great for video chat so I don't miss it. Also, the custom ROM I put on my SD card is android 4.2, whereas google says the Nexus is android 4.1...maybe they'll get an update soon I don't know. So, either way, you probably can't lose.EDIT: Barnes and Noble opened up the stock software to be able to use almost all of the apps in the google play store. So, I don't use my custom ROM at all, because of the better battery life and just overall fit and finish of the Barnes and Noble stock software. It's a great tablet!",5
"Mixed up the review to show how the Nook changed with Updates within 12 hours of opening the box.Opened the Nook packaging with great anticipation. The instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentials.It passed the back pocket test famously. This was done straightaway. Was very pleased with this feature.But buyer beware. I discovered this Nook tablet has no camera at all. Who ever heard of such a thing? There is a reasonable expectation.The Nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously. Everything was smooth and cheerful.The speed of the Nook was very good in my opinion. Page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast. The book pages are easy to read. Another Dan Brown book (I think). Made the discovery with Inferno. Played/watched Linux Action Show and other video for about 3 hours with about 15% of the battery power left.Checked YouTube and Amazon to see the how the graphic's engine worked in the Nook. The motion pictures were crisp and clear on YouTube and Amazon. The sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise. Can hear the device clearly and with ease even though I am kinda hard of hearing. The movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics. The motion pictures were like a TV broadcast. Not kidding.Now the ultimate bummer: their much touted microSDHC card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer. Later, several hours later there was an additional patch of 75 upgrades that made the microSDHC capable of playing video files/movies. The selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in Android devices. The latest Android operating system is 4.4 KitKat. The Nook will not play certain AVI or HD files. It is very persnickety  What the Nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed. It can only play things downloaded from Nooks libraries for sale-wrong as mentioned. I would have never bought this dohickey if I knew thee was no camera natively in advance.One always takes for granted a camera. And their microSDHC is nothing short of a rip-off. Jeez- wrong now.My Chinese Brand X tablets can play my media content in AVI. MP3/4 and other popular media formats very well indeed. These Brand X tablets can play far more movie/video files than the Nook. Their Android versions are newer than the Nook's.The back pocket thing was a real plus. Great sound. Great graphics. Good speed.But these pluses can not counter balance the negatives. The camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me. Now I am thinking I will keep this Nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microSDHC card port capable of music and motion picture replay. Forget file sharing in Android.B&N; needs a No Brainer award for greed and stupidity just like Apple, Kindle and Nexus. Apple, Kindle and Nexus deserve the No-Brainer award more because the Nook's microSDHC does work but has limited compatibility with the files/apps that can play these type of music and movie files.Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig. May keep this on the hope there will be patches further to play music and movie files.If you need a camera don't buy this.",2
"The Nook tablet is a great color e-reader with the ""bonus"" of being able to read your email, shop on Amazon.com, surf the web, watch tv shows on Hulu Plus, movies on Netflix, and listen to the world's largest selection of music on Pandora Radio.  I added a 16gb sd card filled with thousands of my favorite songs. But, the Nook is designed to be an ereader...it is not a games tablet, or an IPad.I got my Nook Tablet (8gb version) from Barnes & Noble because of the extra discount I got with my B&N; membership...the price was MUCH less than advertised by most internet venders. I already have a Brand X color e-reader and a Nook Simple Touch reader. My old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions, the Nook Touch is great for books, but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines don't really work without a color screen.The Nook tablet has very sharp, clear, and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read, even for several hours. There is a night mode, and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else. Magazines look great on its color screen. I listen to music on Pandora while I read, and when I am tired of reading, I can watch a movie on Netflix or a tv show on TV.com. I installed the Dolphin browser which uses tabs so I can switch quickly among various web pages.Vevo music videos look great, but the Nook's speaker is too weak to enjoy music. However, music sounds great through good ear buds and when I plug the Nook into my computer speakers.The Nook is an e-reader, NOT an I-Pad or high powered tablet. It does not have access to Google Play to obtain apps, so you are limited to the apps in the Nook app store. Those apps have been developed just for the Nook and its seven inch screen. The apps in Google Play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones, while Nook apps are designed just for the Nook.Bottom line: the Nook Tablet 8gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music (I loaded a 16gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songs...transferring the songs over to the Nook from my laptop was fast and easy).For folks who want the ""full"" tablet experience, Amazon.com sells the N2A card which enables you to boot your Nook into a full tablet mode, with access to Google Play, and the 400,000 apps available there. And, the N2A card also permits booting the Nook back into its original Nook settings, as the card does not modify any of the Nook's software or settings.",5
"Between this and other popular competitors there isn't a lot of difference in hardware.  The software and usability is noticeably different though, and that's where you should pay close attention.  I bought my wife the Nook Tablet for Christmas and she uses it a fair amount.  I haven't heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones I've heard most often.The Barnes and Noble App Store is a joke.  I looked through it for about 5 minutes and barely ever saw a free app.  Many popular apps and games are there, but usually you can only get the paid version.  Adding insult to injury, side-loading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device (this will void the warranty).  I didn't expect side-loading to be a given really, but if you block those apps you really need a decent App Store to make up for it.The SD card slot, which many people may not ever use, is in a pretty odd spot.  It's not really hard to pry back the cover but since you're working with a micro-SD card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot.  If that wasn't annoying, it is definitely annoying to load your PDFs or whatever from the SD card once its inserted.  For someone who isn't really tech-savvy it isn't obvious how to read those files.  The reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the SD card is inserted.On the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work.  Although I think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a grid-like app drawer, there's little organization to the home screen.  You can drag icons around, to and from the dock, but apps/books don't lock to any kind of grid on the home screen.  Some of us who are more anal retentive just won't stand for two icons being less than parallel.  You can see a better view of your media by opening the Library app, which is a nice app, but I find the contrast displeasing, further emphasizing this is a tablet with e-reader functions (or vice versa maybe).  Basically the cohesion isn't there and you start to wonder, with all of the restrictions, why you didn't just get a regular tablet.I still haven't rooted my wife's tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough she'll let me do it.  Otherwise, if you're not planning to root the NOOK, beware of its restrictions and browse its App Store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a deal-breaker.  This is an e-reader FIRST and a tablet SECOND.  If you're satisfied with its e-reader capabilities I'm sure you'll be happy with this device.",3
"Honestly, I was really just interested in getting an ebook reader, so you won't hear me whining (much) about how the Nook's functionality was crippled by B&N.  What tipped the scales towards the Nook (instead of the Kindle, which was the other main contender for my money), was its compatibility with the epub file format.  It's very tightly integrated with Barnes & Noble's store, and as long as you're only interested in either books from that retailer or sideloading your own books via USB cable, you'll be satisfied with this device.  Unless you're willing to root it, you WON'T be able to sideload apps from a computer, and you also won't be able to access Google's Play store or Amazon's app store.  Definitely a deal-breaker if you're looking to buy a fully functional Android tablet, but it works well for my own purposes.",3
"My nook tablet has really made reading fun again! I was sick and tired of fiddling with reading lights while trying to read in the dark and, after seeing my friend's kindle fire, decided to pick up a tablet for myself. The barnes and noble app market is a bit weak, but I bought my nook to read, so aside from a few games and basic applications its been a strictly literary experience for me. The backlight is great for reading in the dark, and i haven't had any issues with glares while reading in the sun. The stock web browser is fine for basic browsing, but if you're looking for a true tablet experience you might want to wait for the Google Nexus 7 tablet. The nook tablet however, as it stands, is an excellent e-reader/tablet for $200!",4
"8/2012 - Best screen on a 7"" tablet for the price range. Seriously, iPad quality and even sold my iPad 2 for this! =D Very happy and would not go back.1) Lighter than an iPad. Thus, easy to hold one-handed for extended viewing. Can't with the iPad.2) Screen quality is IPS and matches that of the iPad. No issues with resolution, contrast, color, etc. One of the best screens, esp. for low reflections off a glossy display tablet out there at this time. One of the biggest reasons I bought this. Far less shine than the annoying iPads.3) Nice loop hole for a strap - Wii strap works great! Never drop it again!4) MicroSD card slot! Yes!! Expand and drag&drop; media as you see fit, along with CM7.5) Plays more media formats than the iPad. MX Player pretty much kills the iPad for how easy it is to play everything up to 1080 on this tablet.6) Runs 4-5+ hours easily reading ebooks.In short, for the price range and time of this post, nothing else 'better' for a 7"" tablet. Wouldn't go back to my iPad2 ever, and extremely happy with this - total keeper for all it can do!! xD",5
"The Nook preformed perfectly and was easy to set up. I checked lots of ratings before I ordered it, and they were all good.This was my first tablet so I did not realize that it did not have some of the specific features I was looking for. I did return it. I must say though that the camera on the Nook was much better than camera on my new one.",4
"(update) I find my review written about Nook HD included here for an entirely different model tablet. Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.---------------Nook HD overviewGreat screen, no cameras, weak speakers, crappy battery life, compromised android OS, but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast, beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course, its original purpose, to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example, Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed it's easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that auto-deletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700,000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps: Google earth, Skype, YouTube in HD, Adobe Reader, WiFi Analyzer, WiFi Fixer (essential Wifi tool), Google maps, best solitaire ever (by MobilityWare), and free 'run' games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage, but it never works! (It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this)Poor battery life, by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend, so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Built-in email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy (pushing Home and Vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes).Nook HD not really useful for music, sans headphones, because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge, but I find this hit or miss, it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB, but have some annoyances: Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories (like 'kids B&N; files') only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way (that I have found) to add personal data for quick entry.(update)Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet (Blackberry Playbook), but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine, but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput (available on Play Store). It now does the pairing, not Nook OS, and you select the bluetooth keyboard using 'Switch Keyboard' icon.(update)Fix for adding web link icons to the home page. Some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to Home, but this never seemed to work in Nook HD. I think I now understand the source of the problem. The default Nook HD launcher (with carousel) ignores them. The work around is to install the Nova launcher, and it will show them on the home screens.",3
"If you buy this from a B&N; store, and are a member of B&N;, you can get this for $174, which is cheaper than the 8 gig Fire. If you already are loaded with Kindle books, B&N; foolishly doesn't have a Kindle app, but you can, on Amazon or n2a.com buy an n2a card which allows you to boot your Nook up as a full Android complete with access to the Android Market (or whatever Google is calling it now), and get the Kindle app to accress all your Kindle books.  Since I love the design of the eReader  on the Nook, I use my n2a card only when I want a Kindle book.  I find the B&N; Nook books are usually the same price as Kindle.  Occasionally, Kindle doesn't have a book I want but Nook does.  Also, Nook may not have a book Kindle has.  Also, Nook books have the page perfect series, as well as Enhanced Editions with embedded videos and audio clips, neither of which Kindle has.The Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can drag things from your PC to the Nook.  If you want more space for your stuff, you can get any sized san disk for the Nook.  I have a 32 gb one because I transferred about 4,000 pictures to my Nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them. Then I'll drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc. Did I mention the Nook is a joy to use? I actually got thre 16gig Tablet but the 8 gig is as fast and has the 11 1/2 hour battery as well as allows the same cards to be added.",5
"Three of my children are sharing it now. I do not see the need to buy another tablet because I do not allow them to play with it too much. My oldest child uses it for email, news, weather, and more while in school. She prefer it to a computer even she has to share with her sister and brother. it starts in seconds, it weights less and is firm enough to be put in her school bag (with cover of cause).It has the convenient access to the free Istory books, free classical books, and some games that my children occasionally play with. My older children would record some of the books for my smaller children to listen. It save me a lot of time to read to them. The dictionary is at their fingers.Not a bad gadget for education.",5
"Excellent display quality. It runs fast, and does have more memory than its predecesor. The size is appropriate for my day to day needs.",5
The price of this tablet I do love.Thats about it.First of all the design of the the tablet feels very cheap.Almost the whole shell of the nook is plastic.Since also the home nook button neing plastic sometimes it gets stuck and makes it hard to push.The format of the homepage I do not like.If you want new wallpaper you have to download a picture file file onto your nook same with music and video.You do get the apps hulu netflix and pandora but thats very limited.Whats also very limited is the app store.What a joke.The apps are all very boring and overpriced.The book are usually never free.The only Up to this tablet it you can watch flash video which is basically the only upside to this piece of junk.Either save up your money for an ipad or or kindle fire.I will be returing my nook!!!!,2
"I bought my wife a Nook for Christmas two years ago, and she has used the heck outof it, so I have always wanted one for myself. When I saw the price break on this oneI had to act! It meets all my expectations.",4
"I have mixed feelings about the tablet.  I really like and don't like features of this tablet.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that later versions improve the potential of the Nook.LIKE:1.  layout and function of touch screen is intuitive - the Kindle Fire requires instruction2.  built-in wi-fi3.  the hardware is solid4.  the price is competitive5.  Netflix and Hulu are available and app market is expandingDON'T LIKE:1.  no bluetooth or GPS2.  do not have access to the full Android Market3.  no video rental option - apple and Amazon tablet have better market places4.  only 8 GB memory and although it can be expanded with microSD, less convenient than other tablets5.  the e-reader is not as good as a Kindle but then what is?  at least the iPad allows for the Kindle appFor now, I'm sticking with my Kindle Fire over this Nook but I'm keeping my options open for future purchases.",4
"I bought my 8gb B&N; Nook new for $149.99.  At $200 list price I would say it's a rip-off and I'm still not thrilled that I spent $150 on it.Pros:  Expandable storage via micro-sd.Reliably plays mp4 video and e-book files.Netflix and Hulu Plus apps are reliable and have good interfaces.Reliable (but not particularly long-distance) wireless antennae.Bright screen with good color, contrast, and resolution.Responsive touch screen.Good battery life.Cons:  Web browser is slow, unreliable, and crashes often.Limited, closed operating system with expensive applications.Headphone jack is low-rent - too quiet and scratchy with some of my speakers.Horizontal / Vertical screen calibration lacks enough customization options.Made from cheap plastic - micro-sd cover slot fell off.No way to rent movies or TV episodes from Nook store.Hard-to-use music player that has problems playing some mp3s that other devices can play just fine.It's good as a potable media player but is definitely nerfed as a touch-screen portable computer. If other tablets were priced in the same $150 range I would have rather got something a lot more customizable with access to free apps.",3
"Purchased as a Christmas Gift for my son.  He loves it.  Best gift (according to him).  We loaded a few of his faborite games and downloaded some books.  He loves to read, and hasn't put this down since unwrapping it.Hightly recommend.",5
"I assumed that I had the 16gb model but the box was misbranded and my bad for not paying attention,too late to take back to the store but it is still a very good tablet and the memory can still be expanded by sd card. I have since rootedmy tablet and it is great! I do have the 16gb one after all.",5
"Pros:The hardware is nice, I have the 8GB - Its fast, responsive and the screen is beautiful. Great for reading books and netflix. Battery life - Read 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay' on a single charge. Email and web are decent too - nothing special.Cons:The B&N; Nook OS and the B&N; App selection are both terrible. The Nook OS is counter-intuitive and not user friendly, there is no BACK button!? Take a toll of how often you use the BACK button on your phone or android device and you'll realize how annoying the lack of this simple common-place feature is. You can hit the 'N' and go back to home any time - though often I wanted to go Back, not start over. The selection of apps in the app store are laughable. I literally could not find a single app I wanted, even searching apps that they advertise like Comics for nook (not installed? not available?). I found a few apps for $4.99+ that i have downloaded for free on Itunes and Google play (android market).Recommendation:BUY THIS -N2A (TM) - 32GB Nook to Android bootable microSD Card for the Nook ColorTakes the Good hardware of the Nook Tablet and replaces the useless OS with trusted Full Android. Read the reviews, they are all true! Before i bought this card, the nook was basically useless and frustrating - now I have an android tablet and since it is NOT rooted, still have warranty too, though I recommend squaretrade. Check my N2A review for more info.Update: I have had this tablet for over 6 months now and love it. I have had no issues and all my friends and family want one. Note: I use this exclusively with the N2A card in Android mode. N2A recently emailed me with the update from Gingerbread to Jellybean and its working great and their customer service is excellent. I cannot recommend this company/product enough.",3
"It is ok for adults. Fine for older adults who are just looking to use it to read but the place where this thing shines the brightest, it is bomb proof. I gave one to my toddler boys last year and it still works 100%. It has been spilled on, dropped, stomped on, drooled on, left in the sun and even got closed in the auto door shut in our crappy minivan and it is almost perfect. A scratch here or there but truely you could never tell what torment this device has been through.I wish I could get an apple device this durable. In the same time that I have owned this tablet my family, (self and husband included) has killed no less that 3 smart phones, an ipad, one samsung device and a dvd player.The device has also survived multiple refreshes and side loading software experiments with out even flinching.I will say that the b&n; app store is pretty pitiful but like I said It's easy as pie to sideload the google play store and have access to pretty much anything you want.",5
The Nook 7&#34; 8GB Wifi tablet was a Christmas gift for my husband. He had a  plain Nook for reading. This upgrade seemed logical because he already had a Nook account. The new Nook takes cards he already had. He loves it.,5
"This is very amazing. It has a ton of features and has a great looking VividView touchscreen. Here are some of the features and things it can do.-Very strong, I dropped mine from 5 feet to wood floor and it was fine.-Very fast but slow at navigating the home screen.-Has a physical home button which comes in handy in case you want to quit something.-Has expandable memory so you can have tons of content on this.-You can personalize the home screen with your own wallpaper.- Loads pages fast and plays videos well.-Has a VividView touchscreen which does what it says and makes everything vivid.-The os is tweaked which is nice if you don't care about android.-The microphone works great .-It has physical volume buttons.Over all this is a very good tablet if you just need to do basics like read,email,play games, play videos and search the web. It can also do more than basics.",5
"Highly disappointed. I purchased the new B/W touch version of the Nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when I need to do it from the book. I didn't know that you couldn't download the etextbooks to my Nook from the NookStudy part of Barnes and Nobles. Why would you call this NookStudy if you can't download the textbooks to a Nook reader?Seriously!I could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device (slow touch response, flickering on the screen when changing pages, keyboard mistypes characters, etc), but not being able to download a textbook from something that says ""Nook""Study? Smacks of misrepresentation, somebody should sue. On the NookStudy web page, it says that a ""Nook"" is not required, it should say, ""Not intended for Nook Devices"". Also, it will not load onto any other hand-held device that has the Nook app, only on a PC or a Mac. They should rename it to ""DeskTop Study"", using the Nook label when you can't use it on a Nook device is false advertising (anybody want to sue?).Anyway, I'm returning this and buying a Kindle (at least Amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks, i.e. almost all their Kindles, Mac, PC and oh, an iPad!).If your planning on buying this for your college bound student, get them a Kindle instead.",1
This nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view.  The only draw back is the Battery life is terrible.  I am charging this unit twice a day.  My former Simple Touch only needed charging once a month &#34;with the wifi ON&#34; all the time.  I would NOT recommend this product.,3
"If anyone have used previous version of nook you will immediately see the improvements on new version of nook. One of the most important feature I found on the new nook was better page turn response. The screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker, nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest Kindle. The Nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements, such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called ""shelves"".I liked 600 X 800 display screen. It comes with 16 shades of gray and is easy to your eyes. I can read all day without hurting my eyes. My personal opinion, i would love this device more if I could read it at night without lights.ProsLibrary with thousands of books, magazine that comes free, built-in free wireless data network, plus Wi-Fi connectivity (no PC needed); separate capacitive color touch-screen pad for navigation, and a virtual keyboard for notes and annotations; 2GB of internal memory (capable of storing 1,500 electronic books) as well as a microSD expansion slot for additional memory; font style and size are adjustable; displays image files and plays MP3 music files; compatible with Windows and Mac machines; battery is removable and user-replaceable; allows free browsing of full-text books while within Barnes & Noble stores; you can lend certain e-books for up to 14 days free of charge; EPUB format compatibility lets you read free Google Books and loaner e-books from your local library; page turn speeds are faster with firmware upgrade.The bad: No protective carrying case included; color LCD ( for color nook)  has an impact on battery life; for black & white battery is really good,in-store reading and loaning capabilities come with notable limits and caveats; no support for Word or text files; no ability to download books when outside the U.S., even when on Wi-Fi.Does it beat Kindle?According to design my answer is no.  The third-generation Amazon Kindle is lighter, thinner, and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand. It also offers double the battery life, more internal memory (4GB versus 2GB). But the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle. Nook should definitely remain under consideration when you're shopping for e-ink e-book readers. The decision may come down to a personal preference, such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the Kindle.If my review did not answer any questions, leave a comment below and I will try my best to answer your question.",4
"This tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad. Serves more than one purpose ...while its primary function is reading. The original nook is a whole family experience. Its size and durability give the nook, nook color, and nook tablet are built with quality materials so that they have longevity. This is a gift for the teachers assistant at my sons school. She wanted something to read her books on, and since i have the nook color i figured this would be a good start for her.Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader (WiFi only) [ Black & White]",5
I bought this unit as a gift for the grandchildren to read books. My plan was test it out and buy 3 if it worked. I planned to buy gift cards for the unit so the kids could buy books. Barnes and Noble requires a credit card to activate this unit! That is a show stopper as it is not desirable for young children to have a unit with credit card information linked to it. They could lose the unit etc. I loaded my credit card information to test the unit. After deciding to return the unit I talked to customer service about deleting my account information. The answer from 3 people was you can not delete your account information. I can not recommend this company.,1
"I bought the Nook last week, its always a joyous experience to buy something from a store, activation was easy on the device, took some time to create new account on Barnes and noble site, but I was ready to go in 15 minutes.I purchased one book and started reading immediately, after 4 days, suddenly the e-ink screen went darker. The device comes with one year warranty, I took it to the store and they replaced it in 5 minutes, again, the store experience was great.Pros:1- The device look and feel is good, design is sleek and smooth.2- Touch screen is a good idea, I have tendinitis so I prefer to use touch screen over keyboard.3- The page turn keys are in good place, very comfortable to read and hold at the same time.4- Found many books on the library search, it has detailed editorial and user reviews, with ratings, just like Amazon site.5- The format is not proprietary, this was a huge sale point for me, there are other devices that can read the same format.6- Battery is replaceable and memory SD slot is available.Cons:1- The touch screen is sluggish, you need to use it slower than using other touch devices, this is either buggy hardware or CPU is too slow.2- First device I got was defective, not a good sign, hopefully the second one is better.3- Browsing the web is ok, but using the small touch screen to navigate through HTML is not an easy task, especially since it is sluggish.4- Not all books are available in the on-line library, I found a psychology book in the store that did not exist for download.5- You need to use screw driver to open the back cover and replace battery or insert SD card.6- Little bit heavy, certainly heavier than a medium size hard cover book.",4
"I purchased both the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and this Nook (the original) and tried them out during the return period. While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (better screen contrast, and many other features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch (Nook ST) ereader. It is just now starting to show up in B&N; stores (not on Amazon yet). I was lucky enough to find a store near me that had one that was not spoken for yet. I bought it yesterday and have been busy trying it out. It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook ST, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone.  The touchscreen on the Nook ST is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.  I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.I returned the original Nook since the Nook ST is so much better. Note that the Nook ST doesn't have 3G connectivity, a web browser, or an MP3 player. If you want all that, buy the original Nook. If you don't require all of these features and would like a basic e-reader with an intuitive touch screen interface, then take a look at the Nook ST.The Nook ST is just beginning to become available (only at B&N; right now), but I suspect that Amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soon.Here's another plus for the Nook (whether it is the original one or the ST).  The Kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks.  Nook uses Adobe EPUB, which is an open format and there are multiple online sites that offer books in this format (including most public libraries).",3
"I was the biggest nook/kindle hater on the planet before being gifted this nook. I would constantly diss the e-readers claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the books/print was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom (&lt;3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.Also, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!! My back loves the nook. I cannot recommend the nook (or any e-reader in general) enough. You can still buy physical books (I do and will never stop because I absolutely love them) but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life.Even though my first nook was free (making it that much sweeter), I would gladly lay down $100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model, not the color though, that's more like a tablet PC than an e-reader.",5
"I asked for this e-reader for Christmas due to seeing it in a Barnes and Noble store and learning about its features. It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.Personally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, ""user error,"" but B&N; staff was happy to provide a new one for me.It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this ""bendy plastic"" business.Anyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less.",5
"I bought a nook about 8 months ago. I wanted to consider a Kindle but they were not available locally so I was very hesitant to buy one sight-unseen.BN had just released their wifi-only version for $149 which was very reasonable. I bought one from BN with moderate research and minimal hands-on. I have regretted it ever since.Today I said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3. I can't comment on it very much except it is light-years faster than the nook and the interface actually works. I have about 90 books in my nook library, most of which I paid for so I'm a little frustrated.Things that are good about the nook:1. It looks much better than a kindle. While it sits there unused on my nightstand.2. ePub support. I live in Alaska which means it will be another 5 years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it's not a big deal for me.3. Free Fridays. Every Friday nook owners can download a BN-selected book for free. Most are crappy fantasy/romance books but I have discovered several very good authors that I wouldn't have otherwise.Things that are bad about the nook:1. Awful, awful, awful touch input. I cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen. The screen itself is slow to respond, it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait 5-10 seconds for it to actually do nothing.The touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate. You navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad. It will randomly jump to the top or the bottom. It will randomly ignore a touch (there is visual feedback, so it's not a mis-touch). It will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus.Trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word (you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one) is a test in patience I no longer have patience for. The keys provide visual feedback when pressed. This suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only 2 or 3 characters were actually used. You have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you.The touchscreen is the main reason I ditched the nook. It is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable.2. Browser. The BN rep sure talked that up. After spending 15 minutes trying to use the browser to register a BN account so I could actually read books I gave up and used my laptop. The browser takes about 30 seconds on average to display a page. It doesn't matter if it's a real page, the mobile version of Facebook or just google search. It will also randomly crash every minute or two. And by crash I mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason.Do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you're sitting in bed reading a book.3. Battery life sucks. Sorry, but it does. I like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a 14-day battery life on it. I think it gets about 14 hours per charge (minus the 10% when it automatically goes to sleep). There is a persistent charging bug with the nook, or at least with mine; If you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping (as in just normally leaving wifi on) when you plug it in to charge, the wifi will activate internally as it (I assume) checks with BN for book updates. This stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable.This is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi. The next morning you grab it only to see the cute ""Your battery is too low to operate"" message.4. It weighs about 20% more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker. Not a big deal, but if you're in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you're switching hands every so often. Heavier does not always mean better.5. Page turns. When I first got the nook it took between 3-5 seconds to turn a page. I would actually press the page turn button when I got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned. A software update has vastly improved the page turn speed (about .5 seconds now) but only when turning the actual book pages. Library pages, shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds. I have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective (BN support did not think so) or it still sucks. This also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text.6. Screen readability is acceptable. It looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer, with pixilation apparent. The kindle is more crisp and darker.7. The included Merrium Webster dictionary is broken. A large number of entries simply do not work. If you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page. I do not remember which letter(s) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for BN to fix.8. Shelves. Shelves are BN's answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library. You can create a custom named shelf and place books on it. It is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend 30 seconds trying to find your new book and another 15 trying to put it on a shelf. Sometimes it just won't let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook. This adds another 2 hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall.9. Sometimes books fail to open. This means you have to go back to your library and open the book again. I have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention. Once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you're finished it works well enough. But the menus, navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent.10. It's built on an android platform, which means it's buggy and randomly crashes or stops working. A restart usually solves this, but I keep shouting ""WHY, WHY, WHY"" every time I have to. Although I haven't had to restart it since I got the kindle. This may or may not be a result of not using it any more.Closing thoughts: I would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an e-library only to find yourself in the same situation I found myself. If you really have your heart set on it, buy from a local BN and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it. I waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems. After that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed I was outside of the return period and stuck with this nice-looking nightstand decorum.",1
"When I purchased this item it was still running $150.  At the current price, I think it's a good deal but I'm not sure it would be my choice if I could roll back time.  I originally purchased this because I wanted to rent ebooks from the Library and that wasn't an option with the Kindle.  Now, they come for the Kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats.  You can basically use any ereader to rent these now.I read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper, easiest to read.  It's not anything like a paper book, it's far less ""bright"" when it comes to reading.  Don't get me wrong, I love ebooks.  I haven't read a paper book in a year.  It is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me.  You absolutely can read it without a light during the day, but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book.  I have a clip on light, and with that it's perfect at night.  I'm able to read in bed and not disturb my husband, if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--I'm just not sure this is what one would expect.This reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet.  It was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and I didn't bring the laptop and I needed to know when a business opened.  It's certainly not easy to surf, this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch.The battery does not last as long as I expected.  I get maybe a week and a half out of it, if I turn it completely off when not using it--and if I have it on airplane mode (not wifi enabled).  I do read at least a few hours a day.  The time is much shorter if I let it just hibernate.I am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.Obtaining books is easy to do through Barnes and Noble.  You need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card.  You can then order them on the computer, or through your device.  I generally use the computer, but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the Nook is quick and easy.  Transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop, using Adobe Digital Solutions (free app, the library should have a link to download it).All in all, it's a good ereader.  I've never had any mechanical issues with it.  It is sturdy and reliable.",4
"I have been eyeballing e-readers for a while and I was absolutely certain that I was going to purchase a Kindle.  Well many moons ago I worked at Barnes and Noble and stopped in to visit and old friend.  He introduced me to the Nook, I shrugged up my nose and said, 'Yeah, I'm sold on the Kindle.'After playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file.I can store and listen to music on my Nook, I can access the internet (mine is WiFi) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook.In short, I'm madly in love with it.  I have not had any problems with it.  The charge holds for a pretty long time, I haven't measured it in time myslef.It is simple to use, very friendly and there is an incredible book selection for the Nook.  i happen to be a big fan of classic literature and Russian literature and I have had no trouble filling up my library.  Storage capacity is quite large and i have an additional micro SD card just in case, but I am no where near filling up my storage yet.The books are also available on my personal computer, and if I decide to archive a book, but do not necessarily want to delete the title altogether, I can archive it and later retrieve that title from my online account.  Archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your Nook.Recommendations, I have a silicone slip cover to protect my Nook if I drop it, I also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the Nook when it is in my purse, I do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare.The only downside, some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen.",5
"I selected the black and white NOOK over the Kindle because I can download books from public libraries to my laptop and copy them to the NOOK.  We travel full time in our RV, and I have library cards in three states.  I can always find books I want to read from the libraries.  I haven't bought a book since I bought the NOOK four months ago.The display is incredible.  I sit in the sun and read a lot, and the brighter the sunlight, the better the display.  Try that with a traditional LCD display.  Since the black and white NOOK has no backlight for the book pages, it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book.  In dim lighting I use a clip-on book light, as I did with paper books.While I can use the NOOK several hours a day for several days between charges, an hour or two a day of charging keeps it charged.  The NOOK Color has a much shorter battery life, as well as being heavier.The 3G option for the NOOK is a waste of money unless you want to buy books and magazines directly from Barnes & Noble, or if you want to try to use the NOOK as a tablet computer.  It really doesn't have the horsepower for that.",5
Not happy with my Nook.  Be forewarned...you can pay for some books and they will download but you can't open them.  How to avoid this? Open up the description of your book on the buying site and make sure it says for Nook..and not nook color or nook etc...just Nook.  I've had to ask for credits several times already.There aren't enough books available in my opinion to justify using the darn thing. Maybe the Nook Color is a better bet?,1
the nook takes forever to turn the page the battery life sucks it always falls out of its case (not sure if its the case or the nook) i have tried both nook and kindle i recommend the kindle over the nook,2
"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!**************Update****************5/30/2011The Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update..As far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook!I am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well.The performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!I take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!You can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.I also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.As far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.********2012 Update*****Well it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader.As of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.As far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader. Don't over look Nook.  Good luck with your decision.Hopefully this update will help you in your decision. We would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity, just so people can get to read and find joy in reading! Great tool to use to educate children and adults!Back to my Nook!",5
"I've owned this original Nook for two years now and have read dozens of books on it.  I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N;'s concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N; when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N; account with the new address and new B&N; password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.So, if you're into ""going green"", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.  If all you want to do is read, forget the Nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading.  Give the price of the Nook to a local charity.  Everyone will be happier.",1
This is the nook i dont like..it doesnot habe light to let you read at night but have a colored screen to navigate..this is poorly conceptualized as ereader..not user friendly too..,1
"Bought a Nook in September 2010.  Used it solely in my home.  Now, it's February 2011 and it had multiple lines running vertically on the screen.  Customer service is terrible, routes your calls to all the garbage 3rd world countries of the world.  Can't undersand them and they run you through all the tier-1 support questions for an hour.  Still gets you no where.  Finally got a return label but I hear that they send you a refurb item back.  Great.I only bought the Nook over the Kindle because the Nook supports DRM (free downloads from libraries and what not), but Kindle has better controls.  I will find another ereader than supports DRM and eat the cost myself.  Maybe get an extended warranty?",2
"I've had my Nook for about 2 weeks and love it. Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.With the Nook, I have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my Nook. AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.The only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.So far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read. Lastly, I'm glad I bought a case for it because I pretty much take it every place I go so the hard case prevents the screen from getting scratched or broken.I'm very happy with my purchase.",5
"I loved using this nook reader. The bottom touch screen made navigation very convenient, and the reading screen was also very nice.We are now switching to the all-new touch-screen nook that just came out. Yay! :)",5
"I have seen the Kindle and wish I would have gotten it.  The kindle was out of stock and I got the Nook.  The battery life is not good at all I can only get 100 pages at a time if I'm lucky and on airplane mode.  The Kindle apparently will get you 10 times that!  If I had to do it again the Kindle would be the way to go, but Amazon lost a sale and was out of stock...",4
Beware. I bought this used and the person or company I bought it from didn't have the common sense to de-register it from the previous owner. That should be done before you sell it. No excuse.,1
"Bought this for my wife a couple months ago and it's great!  I bought it over a Kindle because of issues I researched about Amazons' proprietary ebook formats and to get library books or other epubs you had to do some conversion to get them to work on the Kindle.  I wanted the easiest thing for my wife to deal with and the Nook is great - had a couple ebooks (from Borders.com and Barnes and Noble) downloaded and library books the first night!  Just need a free download to manage the books from Adobe and your set.  Its easy to navigate, batteries last about a month and my wife uses it every day.  Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"I bought this on the 27th of December after hassling with FedEx (to the point where I made them just hold it at a FedEx office) 2 days later I finally have it after (It was attempted for delivery on Friday 1/6) I was pleasently surprised to discover how small this thing is. I've watched a ton of reviews and unboxing a on it and I guess the camera angles made it look wider. It's so tiny it can fit in a larger pocket (Like pajama pockets). I already have 12 books and I actually finished one just now I started reading it at 1:30pm and it's 11:45pm I say not bad the book was 155 pages too. Once I got the hang of it I was very pleased with my purchase and I recommend probably just getting the Nook Simple Touch but coming down to reading it doesn't matter just read people! That's a little rant. So I'll maybe give another in depth review of this in a week. See you soon, thanks for reading my review.",4
"When I first heard about e-book readers, I was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books. (I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!! I was SOOOOO excited!!Now, if only I had NOT wasted $5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover, that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook... :(",5
"High Points:-Easy to read screen-Touchscreen responsive-Love the physical page turning keys on either side (wish the NookColor had this feature)-Size (can hold it easily in one hand)-Lots of Free Classic Books and Classic Books available for 99 cents-Easily transfer books from your library from device to device (any Nook device or device with a Nook App)-Very organized library (and easy to pick up where you left off no matter how long the Nook has been turned off)-Beautiful design & feels very sturdy and well made-Great accessories-Battery Life (charge lasts about 10 days if you have it on with the internet off for a few hours everyday-MUCH better than the NookColor which gets about 3 days with comparable usage)-eLend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature (which is the only reason I chose this over the Kindle)-Free Updates (as the software improves, you won't have to buy a new device to get the upgrades, like faster page turning, better internet experience, etc)-Free eBook Fridays via the Barnes & Noble storeLower Points:-Delay between turning the page (not a deal breaker by any means but there is a flash everytime you turn the page, which I personally don't like)-Weight (you get used to it, but it could be lighter)-Browsing the internet and playing games via the tiny touchscreen is cumbersome. Not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkConclusion:If you don't have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an eReader, I think this is a great choice. I love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the NookColor. I definitely read a lot more books now and it's easy to take with me everywhere I go.",5
"I bought this device not expecting much out of it.  Reading books is a breeze...the screen is clear even in bright light.  The device is VERY light...feels like holding a small clipboard. I find myself touching the reading part of the screen....just a bad habit as I am used to using my iphone.  As with any device, you might want to breeze thru the manual first because I sure didn't...took me a while to figure out that the ""n"" on the front is the ""home"" key.The craftsmanship feels pretty low end.  I think if for some reason it fell out my hand, it would definitely break.  i have never dropped it...that's just my opinion.  Battery life is good...tho using the wifi decreases the battery life a lot faster.  Though this can browse the net, don't even think about having a good experience doing that...the browser sucks.  Keep in mind, this is not a computer, nor a pocket PC/tablet PC...so if you're looking for something to browse the net, you should buy something else.On a whole, I find the device to be a little slow, but great for what it is intended for. it probably ""turns"" the pages as fast as you would turn the page of a real book.  I'm already used to fast devices, so that is probably why this seems slow to me.**International Buyers**This device will download books if you're outside the US, however, you need to have a credit card that was issued from the US to purchase the books.  I even tried purchasing an eGift card from Barnes and Nobles and using that to purchase my books, and even though i was successful in purchasing the gift card, it will check your default credit card prior to deducting credit from your gift card.  I ended up having to change the name on the account to my mom's name and used her credit card to purchase books. (she lives in the US)",4
"Amazon is missing big by not supporting library eBooks on its Kindle ! I would've bought Kindle, since I prefer a physical keyboard, better battery life and lighter weight of the Kindle (plus a marginally better processing speed and eink technology), but since my two library systems I belong to contain thousands upon thousands of digital books that I can borrow for 21 days at a time, buying the Nook was a no-brainier !I am cheapskate, so I very rarely buy a book - instead I borrow them from the library. Occasionally though I need to buy a book that is not available in the library at all, or in a digital format, or I need it for more than 21 days (as when I travel overseas), so I end up just buying two digital books from Barnes and Noble for my Nook. Had Amazon not been so afraid of loosing sales by supporting library digital books (a groundless fear IMO), I would've bought those two books from Amazon for my Kindle, instead of from their underdog competitor Barnes and Noble !",4
"I received the Nook as a Christmas present.  I already own a Kindle latest generations, 3g/wifi.  However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.",5
I ordered this product and it was not what I wanted. I ordered the wrong one. I contacted the company and returned the item with no problems. I ordered and new one from the same company and cannot wait to get it! Thanks!,5
"Very good product overall.  Manipulation is somewhat clumbersome, but after use for a few hours, it is ok.  I understand that the new version (color) fixes these issues.  The display really does give the feel of paper.  Only negative is no backlighting for use in very low to no light conditions.Overall love the product.",4
"I have been an Amazon fan for a long time. My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N; Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the ""swipe"" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N; claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N; purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I ""haunt"" which have AT&T; free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a ""need"" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N; Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N; store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N; store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.I do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.SincerlyR",5
"First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called ""LendMe"". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N; or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.I'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.",4
in my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable. i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader.,1
"With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very ""in-style,"" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.Now, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.Both the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.Now, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.The biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a ""browsing bookstore"" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.On top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft ""bendable plastic"" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more ""coffee house"" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.Books are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the ""old-fashioned"" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either. The transition is so much smoother on the Nook that you'll forget you're even reading off of an electronic device.",4
"This is a pretty nice looking toy but useless for any real application. No matter how hard I try I just can't force myself to try and read a book on the little 3"" by 5"" screen. The display is small, dim and has poor contrast so it's hard to read unless it's in bright sunlight and pictures on a page are too small to see clearly. It won't play very many types of books besides pdf files and Kindle books are not compatible. Also it goes to sleep if you don't keep constantly moving your finger around on it. Also it's supposed to be able to browse the web but the Web function doesn't do anything but show a Picture of a web page that talks about it's features but if that did work it would be useless since there's no mouse and no way to move around on the page. It can play MP3's that sound ok but it's 100's of times bigger than an iPod and too large to carry around.",1
"I went from the Sony Reader Pocket Edition (which I really did like) to the Nook after the Wifi only version came out and I do not regret the move.  I love everything about the Nook and BN reader store. The Nook is bigger than the Sony Pocket Reader and after reading the Nook for awhile - I just could not go back to reading something on the Pocket Reader. I like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles.  I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I don't have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device (the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up). I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.  I like the fact that if there are any questions about the Nook, I just have to go to a nearby B&N and get the help I need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs.  All in all I think this is a wonderful device - exactly what I wanted.  I usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great!  I would definitely recommend this product.",5
"Sorry Kindle, but the Nook is my book. I studied the various ereaders and tablets trying to decide what to spend my money on. Loved the idea of an iPad, but $600 is ridiculous for books, and it's size prohibits simple everyday usage. Android tablets seem too fickle and the technology is changing daily, without being upgradeable.So that leaves dedicated ereaders. Kindle was out for two main reasons: proprietary file format prohibits library rentals, and removable battery. The nook just seemed the right set of features.",5
"My wife received a basic Nook for Christmas.  Being electronically challenged, she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to ""Buy me a book"". As the nearest B&N; store is 30 miles away I elected to follow the B&N; site to my PC, to the Nook route.  Opening an account on the B&N; site, purchasing a book and downloading it to my PC was easy and fast. Prices are about half that of a printed version. Passing it along to the Nook was another matter.  The Nook came with virtually no usable instructions, either printed or electronic, to explain the procedure that I wanted to use.  After going back to the B&N; site I discovered a little free program called ""Nook for PC"". After downloading that program I was able to copy the book from my PC to the Nook. Everything works fine now, and my wife is addicted to the thing, she takes it everywhere. She still will not, however, try to load new purchases on the Nook.We now have three copies of every book we have purchased, one on the B&N; site, one on my computer, and one on the Nook. With one Nook, it is pretty hard to share after she finishes, and although I can read the books on my PC, that just is not comfortable or practical.  I personally think $150 or so for my own Nook might be a little too much so I am going to look into a cheaper alternative. Walmart has one or two for under $120, one for under $90 that some people like.The Nook is a good option if all you want is a book reader.  The other functions do not seem to work well enough to be practical. The Nook might be a little expensive for what you get, but the service at the B&N; store we visited twice was excellent.  One evening after dinner we visited a B&N; store with Nook in tow. After my wife found a book she wanted, we took the book and the Nook to the Nook counter.  The attendant was happy to purchase the book with her Nook and download it for her.  The book cost for $24 and change, downloaded to the Nook, $12 and change. He even offered to return the book to the proper place on the shelf.  Not saying they will do this all the time, but it was a nice experience, and we saved a little money.",4
"the battery is great-about 12-14 hours from 80% charged.  I was wondering how i would like an e-reader vers a book, and i must say that i don't even notice the difference.  love everything about it.  The only thing that could be better is the on/off function and wi-fi.  the power button is very sensistive and is tricky to turn on (at first).  the ewifi range is short.  maybe 30 ft from my router is all i can go.  other than that.  it works great, and at a very fair price",5
Not worth saving a few bucks. Go with an iPad.,1
"An eReader without e-ink? Really?eReaders are devices dedicated to reading, and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is eye-strain.By introducing a backlit eBook, B&N; removed the key point of eReaders.If you need a device that has a backlit screen (and can afford a $283 device), why wouldn't you pay the extra $200 to get an iPad, which does the job much more efficiently?Please, correct me if I'm wrong, because I really don't get the point of this device.Thanks.",3
"I knew about the NOOK Color even before it was released and I was really excited about this ereader, because I own a Kindle 3 and I'm part of the customers that think that it could offer more things and be more en par with the future. The NOOK Color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen, vivid view technology, brightness adjustments, really nice web browser and mp3 player, etc. So I decided to order one with BlueProton cause they ship it to Canada, and I paid 60 dollars more than the actual price at B&N; and expedited shipping taxes on top of that. I didn't care, I just wanted my NC cause honestly I'm just tired of buying AAA batteries for my Clip light to read my Kindle 3 in bed. I noticed I never read in bright sunlight, I'm an indoors type of reader and I also like to browse while I read, mostly wikipedia and google and the Kindle we browser is primitive.Anyways, I got the NC promptly, I was super excited, but then I tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didn't recognize the unit's drive. Nothing popped. I had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there. I went to a friend's house and nothing popped on his computer either. A third try at a different laptop and same thing: nada. I went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden I started seeing smoke coming out of the USB port and a smell of burned toast. Really strong. I knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out. Everything else worked perfectly, but the USB was pooched. I returned it and they were very professional about it, but said that they found nothing wrong with the device. I bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware. Anyways, I said I didn't want that unit back. Now here I am, with no Nook Color, nobody else sends it to Canada. I'm contacting friends in the US so I can send it to them, buying it straight from B&N; and then they can mail it to me. It's just weird that at this day and age we still can't have items shipped internationally, even when we're willing to pay more money for that luxury.Now I'm again using my Kindle like crazy, since it's all I got and it never fails. But I'm still gonna buy the NC no matter what. I just don't know if I'll sell my Kindle 3 in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now, hehe.I think that for 249 US dollars, the NC is the best e-reader in the market. Right now the Kindle still leads and the iPad is coming strong, but 2011 will be the year the Nook Color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two. If Amazon doesn't come up with a color Kindle with touchscreen, I strongly believe they will be the Betamax and VHS of the 2000s. But I really like the Kindle and if they came up with something like a reader's tablet, I would use it instead of using B&N;'s. However, that still hasn't happened and Jeff Bezos says he doesn't want that to happen just now. So I'll purchase a Nook Color and be happy with it.",3
"My daughter wanted one of these for a while and after ""all her friends"" got them for Christmas we bought her one.  She uses it all the time and reads so much more now then before.  I hate having to pay for books she could just get from the library but our library now offers free books for the Nook that you can check out digitally for 2 weeks with no fees.  Now we get all sorts of books for it for free.  So happy with our purchase.",5
"I bought the color Nook for a family member for Christmas. If I didn't already have the iPad and prefer Apple products, I would have purchased one of these for myself. I think it makes a much more user friendly product than Android tablets, and the price is good. Combine a good product at a great price with an already large library available from Barnes & Noble, and you have a real competitor to the iPad and Kindle.",5
"I have been working on my fiction writing skills, and wanted an eBook reader so that I could read a variety of other novels to learn from them.  The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the ""loop"" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to ""root"" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.",4
"I have had my new Nook Color for about 24 hours so here are my early impressions:Pro:  good quality, good color, responsive to light touch, connects easily to WiFi, good eMail service, easy access to Barnes & Noble eBooks.  Very B & N friendly.  Very good battery charge life.Con:  Lousy quick setup guide (more like an advertisement), Only responds to finger touch (I prefer a screen that accepts stylus touch.  I have large hands and fingers).  Lousy speakers (but I expected that)  I Haven't been able to download movies from Netflix, I'll keep working on that.  Connection to Netflix was the main reason for buying the Nook Color.  Difficult to download other products.  No night time screen.  On line manual (>100 pages) is almost useless.This is my second tablet in the last month.  The first was a PanDigital Novel which I returned because it was an Android 2.0 and had limited capabilities and no access to Netflix.  AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE (NONE).  There is a B & N store 10 minutes from whre I live.  In the past I have spoken to the folks there and they seem very knowledgeable.  I will visit them again with my list of questions.  I'll do an update to this in a couple of weeks.Update.  Raised my rating to a 5 *.  I found out I needed to do a software update (from 1.3 to 1.4.1) in order to get NETFLIX.  The nice man at the B & N store did this for me in about 6 minutes.  I now get NETFLIX with very good reception.  At this time I really don't care about additional apps.  Everything I think I will ever want is in the NOOK Color now.  E-Mail in and out.  Downloads books from the Public Library in seconds.  Internet browsing ok.  eBay access is ok.  Bought a game for $0.99 just to check out my B & N account.  Easy.  NETFLIX was easy to set up.  Battery charge lasts longer than anticpated.  The software upgrade has made the device overall more user friendly.  The only complaint I still have is that I can't use a stylus.  Maybe I can exchange my fingers for a smaller set.  NOT SORRY I BOUGHT THIS GADGET.  Also, good quality and GREAT customer support.",5
"I didn't buy this to be an e reader but as a small tablet PC, and I was rather surprised with how well it works. I'm using it much more than I thought I would. Most of the time I use an aftermarket Android OS (CyanogenMod) booting off a micro SD, there's no need to root or jail break the stock firmware to do this. With the aftermarket firmware, it also has Bluetooth, the micro USB can be used as a host USB with an adapter or USB gender changer, and it will charge the battery while plugged in to a PC's USB, normally it will only charge with the wall charger.My biggest complaint with the stock firmware is B&N;'s app store, the apps are fairly pricey, apps that are free elsewhere you have to pay for, there are a few free apps from B&N; but not many. With the aftermarket firmware I'm using the Amazon app market, much better selection and prices.Cons: The sound is about what I expected, fairly poor, but is greatly improved by using an amplified external speaker. The micro SD slot is in a very poor location making it very difficult to insert and remove, it's located under a hinged cover behind the loop in the lower left corner, it's well protected there, just not easy to access. Don't expect to watch streamed HD video, however, sites like YouTube work fine.Despite the cons, I give 5 stars, I think it's a great value, I have been very pleased with it.",5
"I bought this product used from a coworker's daughter who was phenomenally underwhelmed by it. It is heavy and slippery. The capacitive touch is not perfect, and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently. There is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware. The battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book, and the plug-in is at the bottom of the unit. Since the cable is specific to the NC, I hated to risk bending/breaking it as I can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a LONG time while it recharged. I traveled with this unit, and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge. A lot of the ebooks I own are in .pdb format, which B&N sells, but the NC does not read. I was having problems with the unit not doing the motion side-turn and read thingy, and B&N pretty well ignored me. The local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help. (The concept of the unit being less than 4 months old when it died, and turned on twice before I bought it, didn't bear any weight.) A local computer repair guy charged me $60 for absolutely no help at all; apparently the NC is far too complicated for anyone but a B&N repair person which never bodes well. Now the unit, fully charged, will not turn on at all; again, no help at the forum. Since for $40 more one can buy a ViewSonic gTablet with 10"" Multi-Touch LCD Screen, Android OS 2.2 and download reading apps for it, I'd say forget the Nook Color.",1
"I bought it for my PDF library and to surf the net on the go. It turns out that it won't read non-western/latin pdf documents, unless: a word document transformed into a pdf.",3
"I've had the Nook e-reader for less than 18 months. It's been ailing for at least 12 of those months. At first, it wouldn't start up for no apparent reason. I'd get crazy messages and images on the screen, but no access to function. I went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions. They did. Lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions. The things I had to try were a nuisance but they worked when I was persistent. I learned to fuss around and get the thing started. Then the charger started failing. I'd have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the NOOK. That worked for awhile. After awhile, it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so I bought a Nook-compatible charger from Amazon. Good news. It worked. Bad news. It worked for only a week. I called Nook Customer Service. They said I really needed a Barnes & Noble brand charger. So I laid out another $15 or so. That charger worked for about 3 days.Now the EEG for my Nook has flat-lined. No web advice and no Customer Service advice helps. However, in my last conversation with B&N;, they told me to take it into a B&N; bookstore and have them look at the device. This will be my last ditch effort. If further measures require an investment of more than 10 cents, I'll tell them to pitch it in recycle.I wouldn't have hung in nearly as long if it hadn't been for a NOOK game I'm addicted to and can get nowhere else. Time for online-game-rehab, I guess. I will never buy another Nook. As my kids would say, it's a P**** Of S***.Barbara Cox",1
"I purchased two certified nook colors directly from B&N;, for my kids to read ebooks on, and for some entertainment on long trips, Dr's appts, etc.Things I like about the device:-versatility- now has netflix- great little device for entertainment, as well as reading.-user interface:  much improved following the last update, both navigating the device itself and B&N;'s store.-option for expandable storage- handy for music and mp4's.-ability to make the device 'kid friendly'; the internet can be disabled, and purchases can be made to require your account password.Things I dislike about the device:-Read in store feature only for certain books, and virtually no kids' books.  The impression I got from B&N;'s webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.-Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable, and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot, and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable, so not a huge deal, but I expected better quality...  Also, the power adapter is quite bulky.-did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update (allowing me to disable internet, and install netflix). it was relatively easy to do, following directions from B&N;'s webpage, but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.-no free games & limited games (maybe apple spoiled me...)-prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle (I have not made direct comparisons, this is just my general impression)I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library; this may allow me to use it more for it's intended purpose.Overall, the device itself is quite good- just not for what I had intended it for (in store reading- with the option to purchase the book, in print, from the store).If I had purchased the device for myself, however, it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it, playing angry birds, watching netflix, etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit:The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact B&N; (I initially took my nooks into a B&N; store for assistance, and was referred to their tech support 1-800 number.  So much for the in store tech support...)  I was able to recieve two new cables under warranty, though.I am generally happy with the tech support provided over the phone, but am still disappointed by the quality of the charging cable, and the inability of B&N; to solve this issue in-store.",3
"I am the occasional reader but, I bought this for tablet capability.  It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N; store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.Good:Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.Bad  minor complaints):that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.  Anyway, it's an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.Side Note:  I had ordered a touchpad from B&N; back on AUgust 21st.  Not only did I not get one, they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email.  Not very nice.",3
"When rooted, this is an amazing device, with a powerful CPU that can be over clocked past the normal over clock speed of 1300 Mhz and way past the typical 800 Mhz speed with only less of a battery life and no other ill effects. You will have to download the typical angry birds and fruit ninja games as apk files, but when you do, this device will shine. Other recommendations are tank hero, and Jet Car, and Jest Car Lite (the Lite version has levels that the full version does not even have!).",5
"I have had my color nook for three  months. Its fine for reading but the kindle is cheaper and the nook is  sure not a tablet, you cant get free apps, if you want an app from your tv station, guess what, if BN isnt selling it you cant  get it, thats why they sell these things , so you have to buy from them. I found free ebooks on the web, and down load to my pc as pdf files and drag them to the nook. [...] is very good. The  pages change size of their own freewill, which is very annoying, and the battery life is awful, if you use wifi you have to recharge every day. Yahoo mail is awful on the nook, gmail is fine and hotmail is too. As far as the web, email is all it good for. I wish I had bought and Archos tablet, all the things I am doing now plus a lot more.",3
"I have had the opportunity to test both nook color and kindle fire. My favorite is the kindle fire...1.) poor customer service from barnes and noble - the cable breaks easily, and this device is not compatible for swaps... what I mean is like on the kindles you can basically switch out the cables for any micro usb cable... nook color you can not do that... once your nook color is out of warranty, they will no longer replace the cable, so if it breaks, your like SOL until you buy another one for $19.95 + shipping + tax... The cable is really cheap and breaks to easily... I think each time I've had a new cable replaced I could only get it to last about 2-3 uses before it broke... it keeps breaking at the N...2.) the updates are horrible... basically you will have lag issues and the battery will drain easy if you don't update... actually after a while the battery will just start draining anyways and you can't keep charge...3.) it takes forever to turn on... you have to wait like 5 minutes and keep holding the power button and then like another 5 minutes to boot up... with kindle it turns on almost instantly.... After a while, you still have to wait about a minute for the kindle to boot up, but it still loads quicker than the nook color.4.) a feature i like is that the volume buttons are on the side... with kindle fire, you have to dig around to find them... they are in the settings... like you can only adjust the volume on kindle fire through the settings...5.) another feature i like is the card expansion slot. i like to store avi movies from my camcorder and what not on them, and you can't do that with the kindle fire.6.) check each stores content before you buy. each ereader loads different files... this is the main reason i bought both. Most of my textbooks for school are only available through barnes and noble, but I prefer to read on the kindle. After I'm done with school, I'm going to be selling my nook color, but I refuse to get rid of my kindle fire, unless they update to one that has the volume buttons on the side, and plossibly a card expansion slot. For me, i actually found out that most of the content I liked was available through amazon for free, and it cost at B&N;, so that may be another influence for when you decide to purchase... It's just I wish that amazon would just carry all the textbooks I need, so I don't have to keep going to b&n...;So, other than the software is a tiny bit easier to navigate around, i'd prefer kindle fire over nook any day... just because I get longer lasting supplies and better customer service.",1
"The NOOKColor is awesome- it plays music, is expandable, displays gorgeous color, allows you to surf the internet (not optimally, but the ability is there), and is mostly easy to navigate. From me, it gets a solid 4 stars. The problem is that as an eReader, it's already overpriced, and the Amazon sellers who offer it are asking ridiculous amounts. It's cheaper (and ships free) from Barnes and Noble. Amazon is usually #1 at everything, including price, and I already own two Kindles (I would buy the Kindle in color if it came that way) but the price being charged for the NOOKColor on Amazon is absurd.",4
"I've held off on an e-book reader for a long time. The Kindle was always too expensive and, even now, I don't like the way the screen flashes when ""turning"" pages. After playing around with many different readers, over a period of several weeks, I finally decided to pick up a Nook a couple of months ago.One of my big considerations is that I wanted to be able to read .pdf files in color. The Nook easily satisfied that requirement. What I was expecting; however, is how FANTASTIC the Nook is after Android is installed on it. A friend of my just bought a new iPad 2 and showed it to me a couple of days ago. That, of course, is a wonderful device but VERY expensive. I started to look around the 'net and found that the latest Android Operating System, Honeycomb, can be installed on a micro-SD memory card and that this will allow the Nook to run the new OS. Even better, by simply removed the micro-SD card, the Nook returns to it's normal state and continues to run as before.I had NO IDEA how powerful the Nook Color really is until I installed Honeycomb on it. The Nook is now so great that it behooves me that B & N doesn't simply place Android on the Nook as the default OS! Yes, it's its that good! Just one word of caution. As using Honeycomb doesn't require that the Nook be rooted, it is a bit tricky to install but that's only due to the HORRIBLE instructions that the geeks who discovered how to put Android on the it. (As a rule, Geeks are usually incapable of writing in known-human languages.) I don't know if the warranty is voided by running Honeycomb but, as all that needs to done to get rid of it, is remove the micro-SD card, I suspect that no one will know.All in all, the Nook Color was already a great device but adding Honeycomb makes it AMAZING!",5
I have never been a big fan of reading until I purchased the nook.  I have trouble putting it down.  I'm either playing games or reading.  Absolutely love it.,5
"I haven't really given up my Kindle (which I love and has its advantages). However, I got a deal on a Nook Color that was impossible to ignore and so I made the jump. If you're wondering if it's worth 2X the price, IMO it depends on your needs and wants. For people who want to create an inexpensive e-reader/Android tablet by rooting the Nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the Nook Color is the way to go.It's surprisingly heavy to hold -- MUCH heavier than my Kindle with a cover. The battery life means you CAN'T be far away from an electrical plugin. My last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games, an animated screensaver and some reading. It's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected. However, I find that finding ebooks on B&N;'s site is harder than Amazon and I cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle. Lots of ebooks promoted on B&N;'s Nookstore are $4.99 - $9.99 or more. Too expensive, IMO. Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $2.99 price range :(I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card (I used a 2G card). It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total. I am not a major Geek, but I've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML (not needed for this) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck. The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky. While the original B&N; e-reader functionality is still there, I had to install a couple apps (launcher app and Softkeys) to toggle between the Android and B&N; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily. I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook, and read my 100+ Kindle books on it (and get my freebies too!). You can't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix (yet!), but maybe flash will work with the next B&N; update. note that a Nook Color doesn't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps. A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance's FlexT9 app.Overall, my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color, and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen. So now we fight over it. Will I get rid of my Kindle -- no way. But I find the Nook Color becoming more my at home reader with the Kindle app on it, and my Kindle device turning into an away from home, travel e-reader.",5
"I have had my Nook for 5 months and the only issue I have had with it is the charger cord went bad, but I called the toll free number and they are sending me a new one for free. I'm am lost without it! I have an Easy Reader from Nook, but this is so much better.",5
"Pros:1). Excellent color screen2). Firmware Update to Android Froyo 2.1 allows for minor expansion of capabilities3). Responsive touch screen during reading4). Good, sturdy construction5). Exapandable memory with MicroSD card slot6). Weight is slightly heavy, but not too bad at all.Cons:1).  Although it can play videos on the internet, videos are otherwise extremely hard to find that fit the format for the player.  For example, Amazon.com Instant Video plays .wmv files, which is not a compatible format.  Converting these files to another format is next to impossible, since Amazon.com instant video doesn't support the Nook Color.  Amazon.com, CinemaNow (through Best Buy), and even Itunes movies are all DRM protected and won't run on the Nook Color due to lack of support (trust me, I've tried them all).2).  Not connected to Android app store...Barnes and Noble currently (as of 5/11/11) only has 148 apps in their ""Nook Apps Store"".Overall: B+The Color Nook is a great e-reader with inernet capabilities and limited android Apps.  Although a Android Firmware update was released in May 2011, the limitations of the device can be seen through lack of impressive apps and extreme lack of ""Other-than-internet"" video playback, put the Color Nook down a coulpe of notches in my book.  Overall though, this is an impressive e-reader for the novice user who is looking for a light travel device that can offer internet connectivity and decent battery life.",4
"Before I get started, I'll just say that my review comes from the unit we got at the bookstore to display. The overall product will still be the same, but some things (like the instruction manual) might be different.---------Reading: It's a nice clean picture & the backlit screen isn't too annoying, but I have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later. If you're looking to buy this for reading at length, you'll need to be aware of this. You can change the brightness of the page, but that doesn't change that ultimately you're still looking at a backlit screen.Downloading: Pretty fast download times, although I only downloaded the free samples from the storefront. (Hilarious since I work at a Books-A-Million & the storefront's B&N.; We're so going to lose money on ebook sales.)Internet: Pretty decent. I pulled up facebook & the page is crisp, clear & loads quickly. I also went onto failblog, a site with quite a few side ads. It was a little on the slow side, but that's to be expected on stuff like this. You can also pull up videos on youtube, so that's a bonus.Battery: Not bad, but obviously won't last as long as the Nook or some of the e-ink units out there. You'll get about 3-4 hours if you leave the wifi on. Not sure about the non-wifi battery life right now, but since the company says it's 8 hours I'd say it's probably about 6-7 hours.Extras: You can change the font, screen background color, & a few other things. While that's nice, I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it. There's also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice. You can also change the background on the main page of the NookColor, which is a nice touch. Since we're not supposed to change that with our store unit, I wasn't able to play with that any.Touch Screen: It's OK. Pretty easy to use, but a few times I found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages. Sometimes it would be too sensitive & I'd end up a few pages ahead of where I wanted to be. Not a deal breaker, though. It didn't happen enough to where I'd get overly irritated, but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated.User Friendly: It's not very intuitive to use. People savvy with e-readers & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything. The unit for my store didn't come with any written directions- it was all on the unit. That means that if it's like this on the sale unit then that won't be all that helpful for the people who aren't able to navigate well on the unit.Overall: My opinion is that it's OK, but not exceptionally so. Go for the iPad if you really want something like this. (I know it's more expensive, but if you're willing to pay $300 then paying $500 might not be that much of a difference.) It's basically a Nook/iPad hybrid, but without the option for all of the extras & apps. (Of course if all you want is an e-reader & wouldn't use the iPad's extras, then this is great.) Overall it isn't a bad unit but it just doesn't have anything to really make it stand out. If you're a big fan of the Nook then go for this unit, but I'd play with it in the store first.The only two things that really make this stand out from the other e-readers on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the e-reader market. While the color option is great for children's books & magazines, this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market.I did enjoy playing with the unit in my store, but I don't know that I would choose it over the regular Nook. Of course this is just my opinion, but again- before making a big purchase like this, view a unit in the store first.3.9/5",4
"I'll admit, I bought it to hack it.  If you have no interest in hacking this device, then let me start with the ""stock"" review first.As an eBook reader, it is very good but not great.  eInk and its variants will always be the gold standard by which you measure a reading device, because the utility of such a display in daylight is unrivaled.  My hope is that in time, the Pixel Qi displays make their way into Kindles, Nooks, iPads, etc on such a large scale that this is no longer an issue.  Alas, it remains one, and it is a key criterion for many.  As an LCD touch screen, it is very bright and colors are rich, not saturated.  Touch sensitivity is a little rough, as is accuracy.  I did not see a calibration function.Wireless connectivity is very, very good but for some reason, will not connect with some routers.  The range is impressive, better than my Droid 2.  Speeds are very good, but I neglected a speedtest in this round.Integration with the B&N; store is very tight as expected.  The store app for the Nook is better than the Android app, necessarily: you can browse magazines and newspapers, for one thing.  Display of media is well-formatted and fairly intuitive; I never cracked the user manual or quick start guide (then again, I rarely do that for anything I buy). Prices are competitive with other vendors, and it does handle sideloading of books onto microSD cards.  By the way, 32Gb microSDs are supported.  I run with an 8Gb, and I've filled it mostly with music.And oh by the way, it plays music very well.  Some of you might listen to music while you read, and I am one of those weirdos.  This device, stock, will do just that.  Overall, I like this device, but would probably prefer eInk if I was buying it solely for reading media.However, I bought it for cheap tablet use.  In this regard, it has amazing potential.  Despite the fragmentation of custom ROM and rooting options, you can indeed settle on a Cyanogen ROM and find a lot of functionality on the cheap.  I can browse websites easily if I don't need Flash (currently not working on this ROM); I use PocketCloud to log into my home machines and I can work from there if needed.  I'd love to have Swype on this, or even Graffiti, but it is sufficient to have access to the Android Marketplace and all the attendant apps I have stored in the cloud.  There is no microphone or camera, so those apps have no place here, nor does GPS exist.  However, Bluetooth is available in Cyanogen nightlies so you can now try pairing it with headsets and keyboards.  Thus far, the potential is not fully realized but it perfectly suits my needs today.  With time, this will become a great tablet once Flash is fully operable and the Honeycomb ROMs are fully baked.Stock, 4 stars.  Hacked, 5 stars, tremendous value.-C",5
"First off, do not expect Nook Color to do wonders.  It is not meant to be tablet or an iPad replacement.  It is foremost an e-Reader with some bells and whistles.If I'm given a choice, I would not buy a Nook.  For the price, I would rather get a Kindle Fire.  I own 4 laptops, 1 iPad 2 for my wife, and 3 Kindle Fires for my kids.  Nook Color is an afterthought and it is for me.  I bought my used Nook Color on another site for $114 (free shipping) 2 weeks ago.  And it was a steal.  The Nook I received was in working order and it looked new.I had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly.  The only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets I own.  Again, I reminded myself that this is not a tablet so I had to be fair.  The features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best.Fast forward to today.  B&N; was smart to release an update (1.4.1).  If you already own a Nook Color, you should get the update.  The update improves the speed dramatically.  The navigation still lacks finesse though.Here are some of the goods- I bought it cheap- It has an expansion slot.  I inserted a 16GB micro SD card and Nook recognizes it right away.- The web works fine.  It can now even watch some YouTube.  It also runs Flash.  Nook 1, iPad 0.- The new update allows NetFlix to run.- There are some apps that are extremely useful.  I love the Smithsonian Channel and Pulse.- The magazines look great.  The update also improve the navigation.- The interactive books are great.  My daughter absolutely loves it.And now the bads- I constantly look for free stuff.  Unfortunately, B&N; doesn't offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile.- The apps itself, is sad to say the least.  The offering is a fraction of what you can find in iPad and Amazon.  And most of them are costly too.- While the update improve the speed of web-surfing, it still is slower than iPad and Kindle Fire.- The speaker is terrible.  It is located on the back of the device.  If you hold the Nook on your hand, you may cover the speaker. The best solution is to use a head phone.- The navigation overall needs to be improved. It is a basic Android without much thought.  At times I don't even know whether to double-tap or hold to get more options.Here is my final take.  If you are short on cash, and would like a good e-reader/tablet.  Go get a Kindle.  If you can find a Nook for less than $150. Go for it.I would not spend more than $200 on a Nook (be it a Color/Tablet).  There are much better options out there.Update January 24, 2012I have used my Nook for a month now and all in all, I like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books.  It sure beats a 10 incher tablet.  The update 1.4.1 is definitely a must if you want to use Nook Color to its full potential.  However, I found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dual-boot and disable any sideload of apps.  The version 1.4.0 allows the Nook to load Amazon app and the Launcher EX.  Basically it allows other apps other than B&N; to be loaded.  The automatic update 1.4.1 disable this option.  So, if you are dare enough to install other apps, you can backdate the version to 1.4.0 if you want to load other apps.Update February, 2012Nook continues to lose to Kindle Fire in terms of contents.  B&N; could not match to the behemoth of Amazon and I don't think it will ever be.  However, if you are stuck with Nook, there are a few apps that you must have (they are all free).  It helps the Nook Color to be a good companion in a boring world.- NetFlix is a must.  7 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones.  You are good to go.- Smithsonian is interesting.  Want to learn something that you forgot.  This app works great but contents updates are slow.- Dolphin Internet Explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing.  Very fast and very convenient.- Don't know what interest you, try Stumbleupon.  It randomly pulls internet content based on your interest.  Works great on YouTube vidoes.- Good with words, try Nook Crossword.- Who doesn't use Dropbox.  It is a must.- Springpad is great to jot down quick notes.- Pandora works great too, but you need a pair of headphones though.- Who needs newspaper when you have Pulse.",4
"I purchased this for my wife a week ago as an anniversary gift.  I already have a Nook ST and an IPAD2.  It was a very simple setup.  The colors are stunning and the build quality is excellent.  It is not as fast as my IPAD2 but it's no slouch either.  The screen is very responsive to the touch.  The Nook Color is perfect for someone who is looking for a device that is optimized for ebooks yet allows email, web-surfing, and video.  It even does flash which my IPAD2 doesn't.  I probably won't root it because for my wife's purposes it pretty much does everything she needs, but it can be rooted and used as a full fledged Android tablet.  I really like this device.  It is a little on the heavy side for an ereader but it is a great value for $250. I would definitely recommend it to others.",4
"EDIT - Update 1.4.1 (12/21/2011): BIG update rolled out on December 14th, with lots of big changes, most of which really improved the device.First, the ""n"" key, which originally functioned as a home key taking you back to the original home screen, now functions as the menu key instead, like on the new Nook Tablet. Prior, there was a softkey arrow that would bring up the menu function, and Barnes and Noble has moved that function to strictly hardware. I'm torn about whether I like this update, because honestly, I don't like relying just on a hardware key for something like a menu, especially with the issues I've had with Nook parts (I've owned two cords in the past year alone.) It does makes multi-taking easier, when switching from one application to another (say reading to internet), because you don't have to go to the home menu function first. For those of us Nook Color originals, it takes adjusting from old habits, but so far, it's not a bad change.The reader application functions in a much more friendly manner. The page numbers are on the bottom of the pages, instead of the top, in a much less chintzy font, and pulling up the menu tell you how many more pages are left in the chapter. Not really a necessary change, but kind of nice. There are some fonts added, along with FINALLY adding the option to change the tone of the page from white to sepia, night, or off-white. The books also read sideways now, in a two-page fashion, though I'll admit, I don't use that much, and won't, even with the ability to have it on something other than kids books. Just makes the actual reader app a much more rounded and friendly one.The magazine reader had a few changes that are nice. There are animations for the page turns now (though why they don't have that option with the books is a big of an in-congruency), though the animations disappear when you zoom in. The menu at the bottom pulls up the pages in miniature picture form, but are in a much more appealing, accessible manner. Rather Mac-esque, really. Nothing huge, but it makes it all more friendly-looking. Randomly, the magazine reading app is the only one where the ""n"" button is still a home button, and not a menu one. Wondering if they'll notice that and change it in the future.The PDF reader had some AWESOME changes. Before, reading PDF files was incredibly clunky, and did not resolve well on the screen at all. Reading a book involved zooming in and scrolling down, instead of sideways like the ereader application, and when you closed the PDF file, reopening would take you right back to page one, and never saved your last place. Ridiculously cumbersome, and not user-friendly at all. The new update not only saves your place, but it resolves the page so that the text fits better on the screen, and allows the pages to read much more easily sideways. It also scrolls sideways, instead of down, which just makes sense and follows with the overall expectations of the reading experience.Interestingly, enough, they still haven't resolved the issue of PDF files not having a cover when on the home screen or in the menu, even when the information is attached, which is something I was hoping they'd resolve. It's not a huge issue, but it's just a visual annoyance when all the EPUB files have cool graphics show up on the home screen, and PDF files just have grey with the title of the book. Lame.Overall performance of the menu functions and flipping between tasks seems zippier than it was before, and I really appreciate that. The menu functions seem much more efficient and smooth, and that just makes for a much better interaction.The ebook store also changed around, and B&N; completely reordered all the categories and changed the look. I can't say I appreciate all the changes they made, because you can no longer organize things like apps or books based on price, and instead have to search manually in the menu. I'm frugal, I'll admit. I miss the ability to find free apps easily, because let's face it, it just makes me happy.Overall, I love the update they rolled out, though! It's nice to know that B&N; is staying loyal to their original customers and keeping the devices updated.*  *  *EDIT 4/12/2011: Barnes and Noble did an update recently which fixed the glitches with the screen when plugged in, finally. I have not had any issues with the screen lagging or glitching since.*  *  *EDIT 2/28/2011: A new update now allows for Android apps and email on the Nook, which is exciting. I'm not all that into the apps they have, especially the games, but it's a nice touch! It has also fixed the issue of not being able to put your own books on the home screen, and the issue that the Nook was having with recognizing cover art for those books. I can now also put other apps on the home screen, such as the Email or Pandora app, which gives the entire thing a much freer, most customizable feel. Though apparently this update has cancelled out the last one, because the screen glitches when plugged in are back. Oh, well, I'm just happy to now be able to put my own books on my own home screen! Vast improvement right there!*  *  *Original review, from 12/2010:I received my Nook Color as a gift for an early Christmas, and have been using it for a few weeks now, enough time that I decided I can make an educated review.Pros/Cons-It has a great screen, with sharp resolution. Book title colors and wallpapers look sharp and clear, and the touchscreen is responsive. You can adjust the brightness, though I rarely found the need to adjust the brightness even a quarter of what it could be, since otherwise it was a bit too bright on the eyes. That being said, I found that when you plug it in to a power source and try and use it, the touchscreen goes crazy, and won't even perform simple tasks like unlocking the device. You can't flip to the next screen without several swipes, and turning pages can be a haphazard activity. That weird glitch doesn't affect the device at all when it isn't connected to a power source, but it's such a pain when the device is low on battery power and you want to read while it's charging.-The hardware on the Nook Color is nice, with a muted metallic finish on the front and back, which gives it a nice grip, though I immediately bought a cover, so the fact that it's somewhat grippy doesn't matter much any longer. The weight is nice, about the weight of a small hardcover book, which I found rather pleasant when holding. I still don't get the random open-hole thing in the lower left-hand corner, though. It's like you're supposed to use that to clip the device onto something, but I hardly thing someone is going to just clip it onto their keychain for convenience. It's clearly not awful-looking, but I guess it just seems kind of superfluous to me. Oh, well.-The battery life is surprisingly good. I don't have to WiFi on when I'm at home, and the device will go for several days on low-brightness. I actually had it on one charge for about 7 days one time, and was pretty impressed, considering other devices with LCD features tend to eat battery life like some kids eat Cocoa Puffs.-It's Android-based, which is great. However, B&N; doesn't allow any apps from the Android market, which is such a crime, considering that the tablet could be a fantastic tool if B&N; would open up the gates on that one. The fact that it's Android-based isn't really a selling point, it's more of a potential point to keep an eye on, one that hopefully the company will do more with down the road. The tablet does come with certain apps like Pandora and games like Sudoku, which will do in a pinch if you're bored.-It comes WiFi enabled, and it connects to networks easily and without issues. It does recognize B&N; WiFi hot-spots, and remembers them, which means that you don't have to reprogram the networks or worry about not being able to access the in-store features, which is really convenient. The browser is pretty decent, doesn't have flash, but performs very well. I actually used it for emails and checking my Facebook when I was out of town, and it was snappy and quick, though the fact that it doesn't have pinch/pull zooming features (which the picture gallery does, oddly enough) is a bit of a turn-off, because it can make browsing somewhat clunky and inaccurate.-The B&N; store they have on the device is convenient, loads content easily, and is very user-friendly to navigate. Once you have your information in, downloads are quick and easy, and you can also set a password for downloads, to prevent someone downloading books without approval. Also, if you have a gift card for B&N;, you can use it to buy books, but you have to go online to your account first, and save the information on your account before it'll charge it, and it'll always charge to that card first before your credit card, which is a pretty cool feature.-The reader itself is awesome, and you can sideload your EPUB files easily onto the device from your computer and start reading them immediately. You can't, however, read PUB files like you can on a regular Nook, which I found obnoxious, since I have a lot of eBooks in that format (that are from a B&N; affiliated website, no less). You also can't put files that HAVEN'T been downloaded directly from the B&N; store on the device over WiFi onto your home screen, so in order to pull up your own personal files sideloaded onto the device (even ones downloaded directly from B&N; online), you have to go into the Bookshelf menu and go from there. Which means that if you don't have WiFi all the time (as I do), very few of your books will be able to be put on your home screen, which is such a childish thing for B&N; to do, really. It takes away the personalization that the tablet could do so well, and bothered the heck out of me when I first discovered it. Granted, you could probably fix it by rooting the device, but you run the risk of other issues in the software when you do that, so hopefully B&N; will come out with an update to fix that annoyance.-The Nook does read PDF files, but it's a very awkward process, since the screen ratio doesn't fit the allotted size, making the text tiny and incomprehensible, so trying to reads books in that format is a headache; zooming in is awkward and clunky, and takes to long to be worth the effort. Also, closing and reopening the file takes you back to the first page, which, if you're attempting to read an extensive document in several sittings, gets really old really fast. If you have book in PDF form, I would suggest downloading something like Calibre and converting them to EPUB to save yourself the trouble.-Music loads and plays easily, though I honestly haven't used that feature much, since I have an iPod, and if I want a playlist, I go from there. Pictures also load easily, though you have to have it in the gallery/grid feature to see previews, otherwise they are just displayed with file type images until you click on them to open. Silly little issue, but again, something B&N; will hopefully fix in the future.Anyway, great product, but really, more potential than actual greatness at this point. I love the fact that I don't have to leave the house to read a book, which is great since I'm at home with an infant all the time. Is it worth the money? If you buy it directly from B&N; online, it's $249, which isn't an awful price for touchscreen reader (it's really only about $100 more than a regular Nook or Kindle), so I would say that yes, it is. It's just still somewhat disappointing that it feels like it's half-finished, but I'm looking forward to see where it all goes from here.",4
"For me, this is a better purchase than the Kindle Fire. I just bought this Nook color tablet from Best Buy two days ago,  It's perfect.  After charging it, I drove straight to Barnes & Noble books to try their wifi and buy a few books. TRUST ME, THE Barnes & Noble bookstore employees know how to operate the Noook, and did a better job than Best Buy, at showing me how to use the Nook and answer my questions.  The set up and navigation is easy, and the user settings are user friendly. When reading books, I found that the bright white background screen was hurting my eyes.  So I lowered the brightness level down to half of the default setting.  Yes, you can adjust the brightness as well as the volume.  Nice Browser: when using the browser, it accesses the internet very quick.  While using the wifi in the B&N store, I accessed Hulu plus (The video website).  I was in the Barnes & noble store watching an episode of Law & Order.  HOW COOL IS THAT?  The weight is a little haavy in your hand when reading books, but no where near as heavy as the Kindle Fire.  The kindle fire was both thick & too heavy.  On the kindle fire's screen, I had to fight & tap several times to change screens. I grew frusrtated, took the kindle back to Best Buy the same day, and exchanged it for the Nook.  I'm so glad I did.  On the nook, changing screens only requires a smooth tap.  In summary, unless you need a tablet for business purposes, the Nook ereader tablet is your perfect companion when traveling.",5
"I picked this up as a gift for my teen son. It looks great and makes a nice web browser. I checked and found that it has 1.8 million FREE books! (actually more like 700,000 as there are repeated titles). After setting up my account (which would be changed to my son's after Christmas) I tried to download a free book (Sherlock Holmes, The Invisible man...) but B&N; requires a credit card number, on file, to charge the $0.00 price to.Here's my problem: my teen son isn't getting my credit card number. There's no work around either. I suppose that the B&N; site would require a confirmation password, as Amazon does, but, personally, I prefer entering my CC# upon a purchase instead of creating a running tab for myself or my son.I'd love to give this to my son, but it requires that I give him access to my CC number to download free books and the temptation to be financially irresponsible is just too great. If anyone has had their identity or CC#'s stolen, you can see why this is a deal breaker.",3
"am about to get a micro card with android c7 and use it as a reader and tablet.  this let's me get rid of my netbook,nook wi/fi and router which free's up space and let's me use it anywhere in the house.  hope it's a good move.  cape guy",4
"I have been down and up with this reader for the past 5 months, but since April, it has been a joy.  B&N; has gotten its act together.  The problem I had with not being able to open books has been solved. B&N; not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them.  There is no longer any problem with opening any books.When I first bought my reader, the tech support people were not well-trained. They are now.  I have 80 books on it and no problems with any of them.Now, the goodies:  B&N; just introduced Enhanced Editions of some books. These have videos, audio clips, animated maps, etc.embedded in the text.  It's wonderful.  I'm reading D-Day, and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text.  For instance, you read about Eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the Normandy Coast.  You don't just read about bombing or fighting,you hear and see as well. It's a whole new reading experience and available only on the NOOKcolor (or the iPad with the NOOK app.)Pictures in magazines like National Geographic are gorgeous.  They look better than the print versions. There is a selection of apps for the NOOKcolor, with more coming out all the time.However, if you want all the Android apps, then  you can get an N2A SD card on Amazon that turns your NOOKcolor into a full Android tablet with access to the Market. You then  have the option of booting the reader up as a NOOKcolor or an Android Tablet.  You can even get a Kindle App so you can get and read books from Kindle on your NOOKcolor.Some people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you can't read it outdoors.  Not true.  I read my NOOKcolor in my sunny back yard all the time, and, although I'm a 76 year old lady, I can read for hours on it with no problem.Now for the goodies besides the Enhanced Editions.  You can get an app that allows you to work on Office documents on your reader.  Downloading files, pictures, and music is a breeze.The NOOK also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries.  All you need is a library card.  Libraries all over the US are lending ebooks.  So, you don't have to buy all the books you want to read.  That's a big saving. And, it takes less than a minute to download a  book.  You just connect your reader with a USB cord and Adobe Digital Editions displays the books you've borrowed & you drag the ones you want to the My NOOKcolor shelf.  As with Kindle, there is also a Lend Me feature so that your friends can borrow from you.The touch screen is very sensitive and I'm very clumsy, so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily, rapidly, and without bringing up unwanted menus.  But that was true of the iPhone when I got my first one,Why don't I go all the way  and give this 5 stars?  Because the device doesn't have a ""sync to farthest point read"" feature, so if you decide to look at an earlier page,the only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar.  I can never get it to stop at just the page I want.  The same is true of clicking on endnotes.  When you're through reading them, you have to navigate backwards to the text. There is a Back button displayed on the Notes page, but it disappears before you can read your note.  B&N; has some work to do on this.In sum, if you buy it at Barnes and Noble, the NOOKcolor is only $249, half the price of the cheapest iPad or even Android Tablets.  Yet, for $39.95 more you can get the card to turn it into a full Android Tablet.  It is incredibly more versatile than the Kindle. Page turning is smoother than on the Kindle--or am I the only one who sees the afterimage of the page you're going from while you're turning pages on the Kindle?  On the NOOKcolor, like the iPad, you just touch and you're  on the next page.One other thing: naturally, a touch screen will get smudged.  B&N; says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth.  I found that didn't clean it enough.  If the screen isn't clean, it can get jumpy.  So, knowing that the iPhone has a capacitative touch screen as does the NOOKcolor, I tried using the products sold in the Apple Store to clean the screen.  They work perfectly.As mentioned in my earlier review, I also like the NOOKcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page you're reading.  Also, I find the Web browser is just fine. In fact, when I'm  reading and see a name or word I need more info on, I just touch it and when the popup appears, I choose Wikipedia or Google and surf to my heart's content. Then I just touch the ""book"" icon on the lower screen and I'm back to the page I was reading.  It's smooth and fast.I belong to Goodreads and when I'm through with a book, I can just go to the Goodreads app on my NOOKcolor and post my review immediately. Small touch, but nice.",4
"A decent color e-reader, but pretty much worthless for internet use. The thing will only connect in the B&N store. Apparently it's extremely finicky about the wi-fi hub that it will connect to; meaning most wi-fi hotspots will not work. There's lots of online discussion of this defect in the color's design. I bought mine last summer. And now you have the option of the Kindle Fire. But I've just been reading that some of its new owners are having trouble with wi-fi, too. So, apparently there's no free wi-fi lunch with these relatively inexpensive Android e readers.",3
"My friend loves her nook.I purchased it as a gift to my friend,already own one.",5
"This is my first E-Reader, so my target audience for this review are primarily those who are also considering this relatively new technology.MY INITIAL REQUIREMENTS:In anticipation of some heavy travel, I decided that I needed something that would allow me to purchase and store enough books to last me 6 months. More importantly, I wanted something that would allow me to highlight and take notes on passages. Finally, if the physical copy of a book had pictures in it, I wanted to be able to see those pictures on my E-Reader.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--One of the first things to attract me to the Nook was its simplicity. There are only 4 buttons to be seen: A power button, Volume Up, Volume Down and the Nook ""Menu"" button. The buttons are inconspicuous and don't protrude.--I was able to download almost all of the books I was looking for from the B&N; shop. To be fair, some of the stuff I read is relatively obscure.--I like the ability to highlight passages with different colors and take notes.--I like that it shows pictures from books.--Although it wasn't something I was looking for at the start of my E-Reader search, I found that I liked the built-in games (Chess, Sudoku, Crossword puzzles, etc).--Finally, the touchscreen is pretty responsive (not perfect) and the menus are mostly intuitive.A FEW THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--As mentioned earlier, the touchscreen is good, but not perfect. It can be really touchy and trying if you're trying to get a certain passage highlighted. Even more difficult is trying to navigate web pages using the browser. I don't recommend the Nook as a Netbook or iPad replacement, but it is nice if all you use it for is downloading more books or reading some online news.--Pictures from physical books sometimes show up on the Nook version of the book. When they do (like maps in fantasy novels) they are usually much, much smaller. Unfortunately all the Nook books I've seen don't allow you to resize or zoom in on these maps or pictures.OVERALL:For the most part, the Nook met my initial requirements. Some things I didn't think I'd use much before (Chess, etc) I actually use fairly often and will come in handy to pass away the time on a long plane flight or layover.If you want something that will just read books, then I'm sure you can find something better. Likewise, despite all the extra feature that the Nook has, it is no threat to the iPad.But for those that are looking for something in-between, the Nook is a handsome, intuitive and reasonably priced alternative.",4
"My wife loves this, and it's one of the best Christmas presents you can give to someone who truly likes to read.",5
"I really like Amazon and wanted this for my wife for Christmas but why would the change MORE than buying direct from B&N;?I like the service and everything I have experienced with Amazon but I would not pay $65 MORE (?!) than going direct to B&N.;Sorry this time Amazon, I just went to B&N;.",5
The nook provides a lot of hidden features.. I read a couple reviews and Im still learning more about the product. Challenge is to find parental control,5
"Wife loves it , uses it daily, works good , the only problem to her is when you charge it thier is no indictor light to say when it is fully charged.",5
"Yesterday I spent over an hour playing with a real Nookcolor at my local B&N;, where I've befriended the staff as I go there almost every day as an unemployed.  Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.",1
"I should preface this by saying I also own a nook (non color 3g) and an iPad 3gI order a LOT from amazon so when it came down to getting an e-reader it was a tough choice to pick B&N; over amazon.Why did I do this?I still LOVE the value of a retail store, living down the street from a B&N; i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books. There have been plenty of books that by their cover (yes i judge) and short summary I would've bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books, you really can't experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad. All that being said, I decided to support B&N; because their library is just as large as amazons and I throughly enjoy their storefronts.Ok onto the review.Reading on the nook color is easy, the Android interface is fast and reliable, not to mention easy rootable!Reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook. There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it, I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at $250 (buy directly from B&N;) you cannot complain, Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.",4
"it constantly acts up.  i try to use it for my textbooks but when i try to turn the page it glitches and zooms in.  the touch screen randomly clicks things by itself, also doesnt allow returns.  would not recommend",1
"I originally had a Kindle and loved that one too.  The problem with the Kindle was the button you use to navigate.  I needed something more ergonomic and so I bought the Nook Color and send the Kindle back to Amazon (only had it for 2 1/2 weeks).  I just love it!  It's easy to navigate, turn the page, download and purchase books & free samples.  Just haven't found the magazines I'm looking for, so with that, I will go to the B & N store for assistance.  I also had to contact the company regarding a question on deleting samples.  They were courteous and were able to answer any and all my questions with patience.  I would recommend this product.  It is a little heavier than the Kindle, but so worth the extra money for the ease of use.",5
Got this for my sons 15th birthday he loves it a great gift for anyone great price and it came fast love amazon,5
"I got this a week-and-a-half ago and put CyanogenMod on it and it runs smoothly. Nothing is instantaneous, but everything is quick.",4
"Purchased for my son's school A/R Reading Program as a prize for his school.  This is the third one purchased, at the A/R program's leaders' request.  The look on their face when the one, who wins, finds out what they get!  Totally amazement!  Would purchase again!",5
"I don't usually jump on new technology or new products, but...  on seeing the vibrant color display of the Nook Color (NC), I took one home for a week.ebook Pros:Very quick to setup for ownership and downloading.Quick page turns and refresh rates.An accelerometer quickly permits reading in landscape or portrait mode.After resizing text you don't have to scroll down to see more text on the same 'page'  You just sweep your finger across the screen from R to L to see the next part of the page.The touch screen--sensitive & fast.You can lend books to other Nook owners for 2 weeks, and it really is a loan--you cannot access the book while offered or loaned.  (same as eInk Nook)You can borrow ebooks from libraries.  (same as eInk Nook)You can read a book for an hour each day at any B&N; store.  (same as eInk Nook)ebook Cons:short battery life, 6-10 hours?The touch screen. Don't touch it while reading or  1. a menu pops up for things like brightness settings, text size, highlighting, dictionary, share options, find button, content button & a slider to zip to a page quickly or;  2. the page might turn, or  3. the page will scroll vertically or horizontally.  You MUST hold the device by the margins outside the glass.  Great if you hold by the edges when you read a real book--all others, take notice, as my hands did tire of holding a book this way.You wish, after having seen how you upsize or downsize pages on the iPad (Pinch/spread 2 fingers on the glass) that you could do the same here.On the one I bought I saw some very irregular activity related to the menu flashing on and off without my having touched the screen & also the virtual keyboard would occasionally act up, e.g.,  a single key press of 'n' might give me 'nnn' or 'nmm' or even 'niin'The virtual keyboard requires you to press a '123' button to get numbers.web browser pros:great color and resolutionOn almost any monitor you'll have to scroll up/down to read long text passages.  The NC seemed to know how to center and wordwrap the text on most webpages in the display so as not require you to scroll left/right.Virtual keyboard has a "".com"" button for entering web addressesweb browser cons:It doesn't enlarge pages by the iPad/SamsungGalaxy pinch/spread technique.  You first must slide a finger on the screen to bring up a +/- buttons in a corner and then touch +.Same issue with my big long thumbs on the glass.  It'll scroll if I move my thumbs.I couldn't send an email until a BN tech directed me to the portable versions of [...] ([...]) ""m"" for mobile.Doesn't have 3GSame problem with the keyboard as above. When I took it in to B&N;, it played innocent and behaved well. Later, at home again it went nutty.Final verdict.  Not for me.  Perhaps a later version with better battery life, maybe color eInk, a version of the browser that supports Adobe Flash, a more behaved virtual keyboard with number keys above the letter keys. Possibly a carrying case that keeps my fingers off the screen while viewing.  Technology gets better and more affordable for late adopters.",3
"I had the original Nook, had a friend's Kindle for a couple weeks, and now have the Nook Color. Although it's a bit weird to be writing a review of it on Amazon, I felt that potential Kindle purchasers should understand their options.The Nook Color is, by far, the best eReader I've used (including the iPad). It's not perfect, but it almost is. The LCD screen is very easy to read, which surprised me since I was a big fan of e-ink and did not like long-term reading on the iPad. The lack of need for a night light is great, and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost bug-free. Really, there is no lag when I'm using it and the functionality (once you spend 3 minutes learning it) is near-perfect.BN is quickly catching up to Amazon on content...frankly don't notice a difference anymore. Plus, you can side-load eBooks from Google and elsewhere.I know this...I will never go back to e-ink again and love this screen.I also LOVE the delivery of magazines on this thing. Really, it's better than the real magazine. You get full color reproduction of text and pics, and it gives you an Article View if you just want to read the article. It is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers (right now, it's a decent list but it could be better).I also really like the multimedia support...I can load photos and pics on an Micro SD card and take my music with me. If I'm in a wifi area, I get full Pandora support! I wish it had 3G, but this is still great.Having said that, the Color is not perfect. First off, the weight, while acceptable, is SLIGHTLY too much. It won't cause strain like the iPad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed (you can lock out the gyro so the book doesn't flip Portrait=>Landscape), but it's not the unnoticeable weight of the Nook or Kindle (or paperback). Still way better than a hardcover though.Second, the screen, while great, is slightly tactile, not glass like you would be used to on an iPhone or high-end Android phone...this is nitpicky, but I noticed it.Third, no Flash support yet (and, while it is a great web-browser, it's not a laptop, iPad, or even like my HTC Evo). This, and the lack of pinch-zoom multi-touch, affects my enjoyment of the web brower (note: you can zoom, just not pinch-zoom). UPDATE: Pinch Zoom is here! It's very good, but not great, implementation. Makes the browser that much better!Fourth, the newspaper delivery, while acceptable and similar to the original Nook/Kindle, is not good enough. Frankly, it's easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery, which really is SUPERB!Finally, and most importantly, is the battery. This is not like an e0ink reader. To give you an idea, the other day, I started out with a full charge and I read around 600 pages of a book and did some light browsing. I did not use music or Pandora and did not pay any games. At the end of the day, I had to charge it again. This was about 7 or 8 hours of use. That's OK with me but it ain't the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the Kindle or original Nook.Anyway, it looks like my cons are longer than the pros, but really, this is a great product. I can't wait to see Amazon's response and appreciate the (hopefully) friendly competition that this represents!",5
"Had one since Christmas 2010 and already owned a regular Nook, so I am familiar with the differences between the displays.  The NC is a fabulous, if a bit heavy, device that is a great ebook reader as well as video player out of the box.  Root the thing and it becomes an android tablet, giving you access to a lot of functionality.I have no issues with reading on the NC.  Adjusting the brightness and contrast is easy enough and I've read for hours with no eye strain.  I'm more than satisfied with it because unlike the Kindle, I can read almost anything (and rooted even Kindle books using the android Kindle app).  Works with library lending, free ebook sites and the Calibre tool helps expand what you can read even more.Hands down, it's the best device out there at the price.",5
"I got this for my wife as a Christmas present because we have a bunch of books in ePub format. I put them on a microSD card, went through the arduous setup procedure and now it will not open any of my books. I have, over 6 hours invested today trying to get support help. Phone goes to some third world place and I cannot understand the people. Chat (4 times) is better but they finally concluded it wad my credit cards fault!! Basically, useless support.Returning it tomorrow...",1
"Bought mine a few days ago and returned. It is an ok device but does not truly shine as an ereader and I will expand on it shortly.1st, this is more a hybrid device than an ereader. An ereader basically is for reading documents in an electronic format. Examples of good ereaders: Kindle (of course), Nook 1st generation and Sony. Nook Color, besides allowing you to read, let you browse internet, listen music, play some games and much more tablet oriented stuff. Of course, there is nothing wrong on that until you start thinking about how important color and internet are for just reading a simple book.So, what's cool or nice:-Internet.Full color internet experience, with nice virtual keyboard and ok browser. Touching the screen and keyboard is like an iPad or similar tablets, but is comfortable enough for short emails or using Wikipedia or Google.-PDF supportWith Nook Color not only you can read PDFs in a nice full color screen but you can expand or zoom in at will, move along pages with a simple touch or even rotate and read in landspace mode. This feature is really amazing and the selling point if reading PDFs is your only or most important task.-Full color screenPretty obvious. If you like magazines or would like to get electronic subscriptions of any of them, look no further. The resolution, colors and screen is perfect, a real pleasure to read using a NC. Depending of the magazine you can also extract or read the text or article portion only, leaving images apart.BUT!... not everything is perfect ...-No landscape mode for booksYou have landscape mode while reading PDFs but not while reading regular ePub books. This was a real surprise to me, a bad one! Landscape mode allows you to rotate and read poetry or technical books without cutting the paragraph or breaking lines. With no Landscape mode you are forced to read every book ""as is"" and for a hybrid table which costs more than $200.00, in my opinion, it is not acceptable. My Kindle 3 rotates and it's 50% cheaper!-LCD screenI must admit this device has less glare issues than iPad or Galaxy, but if you have read using eink technology you would not go back and change to LCD again. Reading on a Nook Color for several hours is not easy for your eyes. And forget about using it at your pool or outdoors, unless is cloudy or you find the perfect angle; the glare will bother you while reading anyway. Indoor is a different story but it created some eye strain on me anyway, specially after long reading sessions.-HeavyFor serious readers (those who read novels, fiction books, technical books) or more than 2 or 3 weeks per month, please think again before buying. With about 18oz your hands and wrist will start complaining soon and if you don't have a desk or something to put your NC on, your choices are using your tummy, chest, lap or knee as additional support. A deal breaker. Being a Kindle 3 owner I know what I'm talking about. You can hold a Kindle 3 with one hand and read for hours with little or no problems at all.-BatteryOnly 8 hrs of continue use, average. I bought it a Tuesday, read for about 5 hrs that day, went to bed (leave it on but in sleeping mode). Next day morning turned it on, used it 1 more hour and soon after that the device was at 16% of battery life. (I barely used internet and brightness was at minimum) Another important point about battery and charge is that the Nook Color must be charged via wall, not USB or computer unless screen is off, which means you must forget about using the device during the charging process. The adapter is also proprietary so you can't use your Nook 1st gen adapter or the one some Androids use, I don't like that, I don't like proprietary stuff. The more standard, the more common, the better to replace or find.-No zoom or ability to enlarge imagesAn image with wrapping text around in that cool book? If you can't read it or maybe is too small, then sorry...you're out of luck. You have (at the moment of this review) no way to click, expand or enlarge that image. If you read mostly novels this means nothing to you. But if you read technical books with some images or illustrations on it, the size will be so small that is basically useless and not readable at all. I can't believe this simple feature is absent and I can only hope for a future fix via firmware-Android based but not full access to Android marketShame on you B&N.; This device could be a real hit if was not so closed or locked. As usual, this device will be hacked for those with brave hearts or basic computer skills (actually, it has been) but warranty will not be honored and it's a hassle to keep it up to date after official B&N; firmware upgrades, in case you hacked or rooted the device; also you won't be able to read books in-store if you root it. While B&N; keeps selling the unit without Android Market or a restricted version of it, this device will be like having a Magnum revolver in your hands without any bullets. So much power with Android/Linux but you just can't use it.-No ""read me"" featureFor a $200.00 tablet, I would expect this feature. The Kindle it's not so powerful in terms of hardware or processor and it reads the English books for you.SummaryIf you read a lot, portability and battery life are important for you, forget about Nook Color. If you are a casual reader, looking for a fun device and distractions (Internet, Games, etc) Nook color will fit your bill. Just keep in mind that Nook Color is not a true ereader though, but more like a tablet with reading abilities; if you are aware of that and eye strain is not a concern, this can be a great buy.For now, I will pass. My Kindle 3 is simpler and lighter and does very good what it suppose to do: let me read (or read for me) my favorite books. Most novels and technical books are not in color so I don't need a tablet with Internet access to enjoy them, why bother then?",3
"Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes & Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the ""read to me"" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the ""finger pinch"" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the ""Article View"" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a ""read-only"" experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  ""Lend Me"" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.  I would give it a million stars if I could!",5
"I agree with the other positive reviews. The color nook is an excellent reading machine, much better than either the Kindle or the e-ink B&W nook. Using the color Nook is totally intuitive with only a few positive surprises at some unexpected capabilities. The battery life is around 8 hours, so you will need to have your special recharging cord, which comecolor s with the Nook, handy. There are small imperfections in the Nook operating system that will get corrected as Barnes and Noble releases updates. The same was true with the Kindle and B&W Nook when first released. The key to a good reading experience with the color Nook is to turn the brightness down, way down. That way eye fatigue is minimal, similar to the e-ink B&W readers with similar brightness. Even with the brightness down, the contrast is excellent and the letters clear. When browsing the web, you might want to turn the brightness up a bit to beautifully display all those colors. The web browser is excellent. It works for email, especially Google mail.  The trick with the power limitations is to keep the brightness down when using the Nook as a reader and turn the internet off. Only turn the internet on when browsing or shopping. That way, when you put it down at night, the power level will be the same in the morning as it was when you went to sleep. Costing only $249 (Dec 2010) at Barnes and Noble, it's affordable and useful, especially if you travel.  The minus 1 star is for the few little glitches in the 1.0 operating system (based on Android 2.2), for the 8 hour battery life, and for the current lack of Apps. For what it is supposed to do, it does it well; it's better than an i-Pad (smaller, lighter, and far less costly). Upgrades and Apps will follow, making an excellent device even better.",4
"Bought this for my wife to replace her aging Sony reader. She really enjoyed it as a backlit reader and web browser for many months. Then I decided to root it and turn it into a full Android tablet. Now it's sooo much more than what she ever thought she needed and something she can't live without. Performance isn't bad on anything we've installed. Rooting takes some tech skills, but isn't too bad. I would highly recommend the tablet even if you don't root it.",4
I gave it to my granddaugter for christmas with a gift certificate. My daughter says she loves it & it helps her improve on her reading skills.,1
"I should preface this review by stating that I'm predisposed to liking tech gadgets that are a bit geeky, but do appreciate good industrial and UI design.The NC is really a great color eReader that also happens to have the makings of a terrific, Android based tablet.  BN literally buries the Android OS under a very thick custom UI and turns off many Android features.  This thick customized layer is what make the NC a great eReader, but a not so great a tablet. So while it is locked down, it does what its meant to do very well.One CAN get to non-BN eBooks in either the ePub or Adobe PDF format. Either format works, looks, and reads very well, easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an eBook reading app.  The fact that BN chooses to bury the location of the downloaded non-BN content AND prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder, placing said free books on the book shelf, or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy.  To non-techies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget, e.g., Grandma, it'd be a showstopper.  But then again, would such a user even KNOW how to get to free eBooks?Movies, again well-hidden in the file system, look great, but BN has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen AND the stock player is finicky about format.  For instance, my ripped for iPod Touch movies play fine.  My ripped for Droid Incredible movies aren't playable.  This despite both are MV4 files with AAC soundtracks.  The latter are higher resolution and bit rate so that's the issue.  Again, annoying, but not a real problem.The web browser is just fine.  Pretty much a stock Android browser so fast enough, compatible enough messing around, but if I were going to really do some research, I'd use my computer.With Android 2.2 coming in January, and a BN 'approved' Android market, it'll be an amazingly capable tablet for the money.And that is what one has to remember, it's an exceptional value given the hardware (fast processor/GPU combination, GREAT IPS LCD screen with better color/resolution then an iPad), 512MB RAM, expandable storage, great build quality), and has the best eReader app bar none.  Once Android 2.2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email, better browser, and a more format flexible music/video player the value will be simply unassailable...at the price.Pros:Great screen - overall looks, color quality, text quality, adjustabilityeReader UIMagazine format is excellentNewspaper and magazine subscriptions are month to monthBuild qualityIndustrial design - it actually sit flat on a table unlike the iWobleMicroSD supportForm factor - fits MANY of the now discontinued or about to be discontinued Amazon Kindle 2 cases!Battery life (for such a lightweight LCD based device in its size range)Full Android experience just a hack awayUnderlying processor/GPU/RAM is quite powerful though not tops, but more then capable of moving to Android 2.2 and possibly even GingerbreadCan read library eBooks if your local library carries themCons:THICK BN UI if you really want the tablet partsUI takes a few minutes to learnBluetooth not enabled (though it may be Bluetooth ready)No microphone (and therefore no Skype down the road unless the headphone jack can be used like early generation iPod Touches)Will need to hack if the BN Nook Market does not have what you want in terms of appsBN prices their books too highBN magazine subscriptions can be high, though some are a good valueNo camerasRecommended to the magazine/newspaper reader especially.  Best of the LCD eReaders, period. Great value in an Android Tablet.",4
"First off, for those of you buying this product expecting the e-ink experience, you are wrong.  This isn't an e-ink screen, if that is what you are looking for, go with (a) the original nook, (b) the kindle, or (c) any of the other e-ink dedicated e-readers on the market.This iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers:-The Magazine reader-Students with text books that have graphics-Childrens' books with lots of pictures-Comic book readersIf you notice, these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics, which is something e-ink can't yet do!PRICEFor the price, you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality, though, with some technical knowledge, it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market (though it may void your warranty, so do it at your own risk).  Similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color, but they come with full functionality.  Another device this has been compared to is the iPad- which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model.  On the price point, you are definitely getting a decent deal, though, you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost.Also note, you are not getting 3G access or any other cellular service to access the market- unlike the original nook, that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go.  The likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser- this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content- which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get.  Instead of mobile data service, users have the option of accessing the BN market and the full internet through wireless.  With today's cell phone technology, many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go- when they are away from their home network.  Overall, this isn't a big deal to me, but I am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the BN market, so this would be a draw back for you for sure.WEIGHTHonestly, this device does run a little on the heavy side, however, I do believe that it is slightly lighter than it's predecessor.  Still, for the e-reader market, it is heavy.  For the tablet market, it is a little more reasonable.  The weight is a sacrifice, but as long as you aren't trying to read while laying on your back, you should be ok.USER FRIENDLINESS AND EXTRA FEATURESI find this device to be quite simple almost immediately.  Every function that I have looked for has been where I expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me.  The page controls while you read work great, and I love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook.The full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard (which is always annoying).This device also integrates with your facebook, twitter, and google accounts.  This is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media.Another feature that is nice to have on the reader is Pandora- it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader.One thing I wish this device had was access to android market, but I guess you can't have everything.OVERALLI like this tablet.  I think it was a good buy and I would buy another one if this one broke.  For the price, you are getting an underpowered tablet, but it still has access to the full internet- which you can use multiple windows in.  It is primarily a reader, which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as e-ink, but for the market it is being geared towards, you can't really complain about that!",4
"It came early which is nice, it didnt come with a box which was already described in the details. but It was nice, came as described and worked fine.",4
"I didnt buy my Nook Color to read. I bought it because I wasn't thrilled at paying $500 for an iPad. As long as you have a micro SD card and can follow a few simple instructions, you can turn this into a fully-functional Android tablet. Best of all, you can run Android entirely from the SD card (I recommend 16 or 32gb) and if you need to put this back into ""Nook mode"" (for instance, for warranty repair), simply remove the SD card and it will be as if you never did anything out of the ordinary. With the CPU overclocked to 1.1 ghz, I can play Angry Birds, listen to music, and download a file all at the same time, and that's the heaviest usage scenario I can really envision for one of these.",5
"Well, for the price, it's easily the best Android tablet out there if you don't care about not having 3G, GPS, and camera. Took less than 5 minutes to root it once I did all the reading on nookdevsdotcom wiki. Installed Launcher Pro, Google Maps, few widgets, Angry Birds, and Opera browser.The device has great style and build quality and battery seems to last pretty good in my 10 hours of play time with it. Screen is gorgeous. I think if they skipped hard metal and went for carbon metal or good plastic it probably would have shed few ounces in weight and would have felt lighter to hold for long time. That is no deal breaker though as the 7"" size is perfect to hold for long time unlike other tablets that are way too big to hold with single hand for reading.Tried couple of kids books for my daughter and the color screen makes the content look rich and attractive. Will soon be trying out periodicals and photography books. But my main intention of owning it is for tablet and I would recommend it. I read instructions on how to make NookColor connect to Adhoc WiFi Hotspot. Once I get that working, I can Tether the NookColor with my rooted Xperia X10 to browse while I have no WiFi networks around.I wish I have some cons to mention but that would be silly at it's price point. It's a real steal at it's $249 price.",5
"High Points:-Very Responsive Touch Screen-Touch screen is easy on the eyes even though it's back lit-Page Turning (very fast, instant, and seamless - no flashing or delay - my favorite feature)-Very organized menu-Decent sound quality-Physical home screen button (very useful)-Free eBook Fridays curtesy of Barnes & Noble-eLend technology from your local library (if they offer this service, mine does, it's a very nice feature to have, only reason why I chose a Nook over a Kindle)-The kids books are fun to read on this-The internet browsing experience is quite nice. Web pages load quickly-The interface and device are both very beautiful-Great accessories available for item-Great Size - fits easily in my hand-Back Lit display is very very nice to have - no need for a flashlight - can read in the dark)-Very easy to book mark pages-Playing games on this are a lot more fun than playing games on the original Nook (thanks to the touchscreen)-Barnes & Noble eBook store is quite nice and easy to browse-The on-screen keyboard is also niceLower Points:-BATTERY LIFE (if I used the internet at all, I'm lucky if it lasts through the day on a full charge - with the internet off, it still only last about 3 days if you use it everyday - the standby battery life (with the device in sleep mode-not off) is pretty good though.-No physical page turning button - sometimes I advance or flip backwards by accident-Weight (not a deal breaker, you get used to it, but it could be a lot lighter)Conclusion:I love love Love my NookColor. I take it with me everywhere I go. There's no 3g option that I'm aware of, but I only browse the internet with I'm at home anyway. The battery doesn't last long enough for you be connected to the internet too often anyway. There is no cool page turning animation like on an ipad, it just changes instantly to the next page, which is still a great feature on this item. It's not so great as a tablet though. The internet browser is great, but there is no flash support (not for the ipad either though) and there are few apps. That is not important to me as I'm using this as an eReader and occasionally play the included games on it when I'm bored (sodoku, crossword, chess). I like that you can play music and listen to it in the background. When connected to the internet, the Pandora Radio app is nice to have in the background, though I've found it rather difficult to turn off when I'm done with it.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an eReader and doesn't care if they have to charge it back up every few days.",5
"Technology changes and grows with each passing second, so sometime in the future, something else will eventually dethrone the NookColor (just 'tis the way of things...I was a Blackberry fangirl, and converted to Android when it finally stepped up to the plate...but Blackberry was 'the best' for me until Droid).Anyway...with that said as justification for my 'current' qualifier in the title....for me in the current available items on the market, it's NookColor all they way, baybee.The screen is fantastic, both indoors and out, and it's readability is profound.  I don't like it's failure to be as responsive whilst plugged in and charging, but when not plugged in, I've yet to have a problem with it.I love how it's divided into different options, and that it supports PDF as well as the ePUB format.  There are books galore out there in this manner.  I also love that I can share this particular unit with my 7 year old daughter who is just starting chapter books, but still has a love for picture books.  We have several Tomie DePaola books on there already for her!As an Android fan, I'd of course love to see it connect to the Android Market...but I didn't buy this to be a bigger version of my Android. I bought it to be an eReader.  With the add'l memory space avaialble, and the fact that the battery CAN be replaced, just those two features alone for me raise the Nook or NookColor head and shoulders above the Kindle.That said...while I had a slight preference for the Nook itself over the Kindle, I'm even more thrilled I waited until the NookColor came out.  I'm looking forward to a long future snuggled up with my new best friend. ;)",5
"I got a Nook Color for my anniversary, and returned it within the 2-week trial period.  It worked fine; it just was rather pointless.  I have a Kindle, but I wanted something more functional that I could read in the dark (I LOVE my Kindle - the Nook was in addition to, not as a replacement).  To make the Nook into a true tablet, you have to hack it.  We did that, and it was ok, but still not able to access the entire Android market and some apps just didn't work right.  I did a factory reset and returned it, then ordered an actual Android tablet (which I have not yet received, so I can't compare them yet).  There wasn't anything wrong with the Nook, really.  It was just a lot of money for what is basically a glorified e-reader.",3
"I got mine from B&N; and I'm very happy with it! My color ebooks look so great on it. The only problem I have is with playing youtube videos. I'm using the link B&N; put on my bookmarks.Other than that though, its awesome. It works really well & haven't had any trouble with any ebooks....however some image scanned pdf books need to be flicked up/down instead of sideways like regular books.UPDATE:After playing with it a little longer, I got things going better. My youtube videos all work fine and I love it even more now.I have actually purchased a few different ereaders before this since I was trying to find one I liked (such as Sony Touch, kindle and a few others which are all newest models) and my NookColor is my absolute favorite!A few problems that I hope may be fixed with future updates is when I visit certain pages (ex: google.com) & tap a text box to type something in, my keyboard will dissappear & I have to tap text box a few times to get it to reappear.The other thing is my sound seems very low when turned up all the way.In any case, I still LOVE it. The color is AMAZING & I can use this for hours! No eye strain trouble here & it is able to read EVERY ebook I load onto it. I haven't had to buy any B&N; books yet because I already owned so many",5
"REVIEW....Part 2:Loved my Nook Color before the new software updates and app additions...but now!!  WOW!! I own a Motorola Xoom Tablet and have only had it for about a month.  If these updates had come a month earlier I may never have purchased the Xoom, but with that said, and now that I have both, their are differences that I'm glad to own both.Nook Color for the value:emailgamesadobe flash (you tube and much more)musicreading (books and magazines with brilliant color) prefer the Nook for reading bookssurfing the internetsize (easy to hold)and for women it fits in my handbagVersus...Motorola Xoom:emailgamesadobe flash (you tube and much more)sharper picture when viewing movies/videosmusicreading (from kindle and nook downloads to the Xoom with their apps)surfing the internetsize (being larger for a better viewing experience) it won't fit in my handbag (but that's mine)quality is amazingmuch more....There are many many things similar to the Nook versus Xoom or Ipad but the value of the Nook Color over the others isthe best and for your average user who just wants to surf the net, view videos, read your email, listen to music andplay (at the moment limited games) and to read books (size for holding to read is perfect) the Nook Color is the BEST valueand it won't disappoint.1st review:Received my NookColor for Christmas and waited until now to write my review.  I wanted to make sure what I write will help others.  Take this device for what it is....a e-reader and not a tablet.  I love it for reading ebooks and emagazines.  A perfect size for books and just a little too small for magazines but if you have patience you can make any page larger just by pinching your fingers open.The color of photos are amazing and beautiful.  I can view just about any website, but not videos from flash.  Again this is not a tablet. But I can view many Youtube videos.  I have downloaded my own photos and they look great.I cannot open my emails from my carrier (comcast), not sure why. The website...but not the individual emails from my contacts.The touchscreen is pretty sensitive and sometimes I end up having to do things twice.I gave my review four stars only...because of my email restrictions and the sensitivity of the touchscreen.Overall I do love the size and the many things you can do with the NookColor.FYI...I typed this review on my NookColor...",5
"You can get this for about $40 less at B&N directly (plus tax), or at that same lower price, without tax, at their site.",2
I bought this item for my wife for Christmas. I didn't know what to expect since this wasn't what she actually wanted. But I knew what she needed as she is a book worm and has magazines n books strayed everywhere. She also has no intent on getting rid of them no time soon. Needless to say it had to grow on her (she wasn't too thrilled at first). Now that thing is everywhere and I don't haveto live with magazines everywhere taking up space.  Afterward I bought an hd+. We've been more than happy with our decision.,4
"The ColorNook was a great device when they first put it out at the end of 2010. However, it is incredible with the new upgraded software that came out at the end of April 2011. You can do email, there are apps, videos are super!!! And there is flash. I also like the fact that I can adjust the brightness of the screen to prevent eyestrain.You can have multiple email addresses on the email account, which is great for me as I have 3 separate email addresses. In an effort to protect my computer from emailed viruses, I am opening my email on my Nook. That way if a virus sneaks in, it takes out a less expensive device than my computer.I also like the idea of being able to subscribe to magazines that are photo intensive and I can actually see the pictures in color.That said, I still like my Kindle ereaders very much for reading books.",5
"The Nook Color is OK as an e-book reader and the apps Barnes and Noble offer are OK, but I installed a 16gb SD card with the Android OS and this thing is smokin.  I can watch Netflix, listen to local radio stations and you can get any of the apps in the world, not the just few Barnes and Noble offer.",5
"I bought the Nook color after using the original Nook wifi to read a few books.  I'm sure like many people I was drawn to the ""color"" of the screen.  It is crystal clear, it's great for books with drawings or art in them.  Really brings it to life.  This is about all I've really liked.What I don't like is its heavy.  Compared to the original Nook and the Kindle it's a heavy monster.  The screen glares with everything.  I hate seeing myself in the screen when I'm trying to read.  The touchablilty of the screen is 100 times better than the b/w Nook.  It doesn't turn when you turn the Nook itself, even though you have the screen adjustment feature turned on.  Did I mention it was heavy?  Also I took it outside and yes I adjusted the brightness all the way up.  However, I could not read the screen with my sunglasses on even at its brightest setting.  It's like my Iphone, can't see the screen in sunlight.  This is the part that frustrated me the most.  Also the lighted background of the reading screen seemed to make my eyes excessively tired after long periods of reading.  The battery life is pretty short too.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this ereader.  Get the Kindle, you'll be much happier and it's cheaper.  Also Kindle books don't charge tax to buy them like Nookbooks.",2
"I bought a refurbished Nook Color a few months ago as well as a dual-boot android Micro-SD card (from eBay).  This is by far the best value tablet I've found anywhere!  NC is well made, arrived in like-new condition, reliable, responsive and by booting to full Android (with the dual-boot micro-SD) it is a real tablet with full access to the Android market. Only cons are lack of microphone or camera, but for a total cost of &lt;$180 it's awesome!  Good battery life, beautiful screen, responsive and a really excellent reader (especially in low light - but the screen can be made very bright for daytime use).  I also have a Kindle keyboard which I love for daytime reading but the NC works in the evenings in a darkened room and does all the other things a tablet can do.  Just NC on a holiday trip and left my laptop behind!  NC was perfect for email, RSS, games and reading, including pdf books and Netflix movies.  If you have an Android phone, using this is the same with a much better screen.  It's a really good tablet as is, but with the dual-boot MSD card it is an awesome deal!",5
"I went into the tablet market for two reasons: (1) I read mostly inside in the evenings and was tired of needing a book light for the e-ink reader and (2) I wanted to consolidate my travel electronics from phone + ereader + notebook.  The prices of straight tablets were outrageous to me when my primary purpose was to eliminate taking the laptop along to be able to review email and do moderate web browsing on a decent sized screen (the phone was way too small).  After reading several reviews and recommendations, I settled on a used Nook Color for both price and performance.  I have not been disappointed.  I have rooted my device for a full blown Android experience and a far superior web browser but rooting is not needed for the basics. I'm just someone who likes to tinker.Everyone needs to understand, this is an e-reader first and a tablet second even when rooted.  At $200, you cannot expect what you would get with a $500-$600 device.  But, it does what it is intended to do quite well.  At 7 inches the screen is comparable size to most e-readers and that was important to me for portability.  I simply swapped the e-ink reader for the Nook Color and it still fit perfectly in my purse.  The Nook Color is also really good for reviewing emails and smooth web browsing.  My rooted device has an overclocked processor so I have no problems with speed.  It's perfect for quickly reaching out to the web to check the latest news, weather, etc. and then get right back to reading my books.  I haven't had many problems running other Android tablet applications and have found that the problems I have had seem to be common problems with the applications themselves.If you want a premium e-reader, this is a super nice product at a great price.  If you're looking for a budget tablet without all of the bells and whistles (camera, gps, microphone) but that will handle the basics of email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and other consumption tasks, this is more than adequate and enjoys much more favorable reviews than similarly priced tablets (with the exceptions of the Kindle Fire and its own successor the Nook Tablet).  The bottom line with this little marvel is to keep your expectations in line with what you're paying for and what you're not paying for. If you expect a $200 version of the standard bearer (i.e IPad), then you'll be very happy.  If, however, you're expecting a $200 equivalent, then look elsewhere.",4
"I have a Amazon Kindle E-reader and few hundred books and was wondering ifthe ""Nook"" works on the same book format (mobi) as the kindle.  I Emailed a friend last night and he wrote back this morning  saying his Nook was dead in the water (it can happen with any of them)  What was funny was he said he wrote a review on the Nook  and said that he purchased a Color Nook and have enjoyed it for many years. Then one day it stopped working so he called customer service and was transferred to some foreign country where the woman could not speak English well,  so he asked to speak to another. Next a man came on who spoke worse that the woman so he asked if there was another person. When talking to the next person he was rude so he  asked customer service if he  could sent it in for repair.  The Nook Rep.  had gotten mad and said sure sent it back to North Korea and hung up the phone.  He said he  sent a number of Emails and they didn't  respond or when they did they say read the manual.  So John the Nook is great until you need service but to answer your question I can't open mine  to see the format so you may have to go by a Barnes and Nobel and ask them. You may need to hurry as Barnes and Nobel books stores may be closing the doors soon. Most everyone is switiching over to the E-readers.",1
"I was looking for a e-reader for our 13 year old's birthday this past October.  After researching the popular e-readers i.e. the Kindle Fire, I went with the Nook Color for one simple reason; the ability to Root it and turn it into an Android tablet, for a lot less! (It also takes a macroSD card). While you can find the Kindle rooted too, I found the Nook Color rooted was more readily available and more affordable. Since I was purchasing for a teen I  did not want to get a new or more expensive model.We purchased one that was already rooted to cyanogenmod 7.  You can also purchase an macro SD card here or on Ebay that is rooted for you if you already own a Nook Color.We connected it to our home wi-fi and Viola, she can do everything i.e. text free, download games and unlimited apps from the Market. The rooted Nook Color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phone/video calls.Note, all rooted Nook Colors are not the same version.  We purchased one for our son for this Christmas and I did not notice it was not cyanogenmod 7.  This is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the Google Play (or Android market) as our daughter's does.  You can update the Root software and I did that but I did not notice a change in its ability to download the other apps. But honestly, I was tired at that point and gave it to our son on Christmas as it was good otherwise and I doubt he would notice. LolThis model is perfect for my teens, but I am thinking about the Kindle Fire HD for myself because it has a good camera and I love photography.P.S. I also purchased a silicone case in yellow and it brightens up the dark tablet a lot.  (I purchased both Nook Color e-readers used for $66 and $87 each on Ebay.)",4
this was a life saver for me after my wifes operation it kept her occupied we still have it and she loves great investment,5
"I don't know why people make fun of these I just happen to love mine. It's very versatile, easy to use, you can add more space, and it's not too big. And it seems like they are getting huge now. I get hours of enjoyment out of it from reading, doing puzzles, playing games and listening to music. And mine is used!",5
"I'm sure a lot of other potential E-Book wanna-be owners are wondering which one to buy. I was ready to order a Kindle, sight unseen, because anything that sells that well with so many rave reviews has to be good. Then I went to a local ""big Box"" store that carries the Kindle and the NookColor and seeing the fantastic color screen of the Nook sold me on that one.  Nothing against the Kindle but the NookColor brings childrens books (I have a 4yo granddaughter) and magazines to life.The Nook has a few quirks but none are deal breakers.  If you can, take one for a test drive.",5
"I bought the Nook Color for its intended role as an ebook reader. I have a Kindle DX but it has trouble with many of the tabletop RPG PDFs I throw at it and the 4GB is a tad small to hold my 14GB collection. The built-in PDF reader is worthless, slow to open files the Kindle DX had no trouble with and wouldn't even turn pages. I jail broke it, install a mostly vanilla image of Froyo and installed Adobe Acrobat and from there it shined. Page turning and navigation was a breeze and it complimented (read not-replaced) the Kindle DX quite well.It's a tad small for anything more in-depth than book reading and Angry Birds. Even casual web browsing can be a pain and it's place as a bastard hybrid of a phone OS on a 7"" tablet form factor means it has the worst of both worlds. Maybe once (if?) Android tablets take off we'll see mobile pages more suited to them. The huge up side is that it fits perfectly in a large coat pocket and looks sleek enough to make you look cool removing it from the pocket of an aviator jacket.In the end it spends most of its time sitting on a shelf collecting dust. It'll probably end up a gift for someone who doesn't mind lower-end electronics. These days while the Kindle Fire looks good I'm waiting on the market to mature and Windows 8 tablets to ship before I go looking again.",3
"A syndicated consumer advocate has a saying: ""I am willing to pay less for less.""  So am I.  I actually bought the Nook Color (NC) more for its tablet features than its e-book features.  I considered several tablets for at least double the price, but when the new Android OS was released for the NC, I decided to try it out.  I personally have not been disappointed.Here is what it doesn't have: camera, USB accessory support, fast processor, robust app forum, 3G model, and long battery life.  But as I said I am willing to pay less for less.  I primarily wanted it for basic web browsing (with Flash capability), movie playback, e-mail capability, and e-book capability.My experience has been great so far - I have had my NC for about six weeks.  I personally have had no problem with the web browser and it has met all of my needs.  Movie viewing has been fine and I have had no problems viewing them.  I use Handbrake to convert movies/videos to a format for the NC, and it works great.  I have several e-mail accounts I use for personal and business purposes, and the POP3 support the NC offers is perfect.  I am no longer tied to my PC, laptop, or confined to the small screen of a mobile phone.  As for the e-book reader, it's great as should be expected (My 8 year old daughter actually uses it for reading more than me.  I download books from the library for her, and she loves it.)  The notation, highlighting, and other reading tools are fine and it also has several options to customize the font and background color as well as the font size.Other reviewers have commented about crashes, but I have not had a single crash yet.  And I also don't think the stock Android OS is bad at all, but with this being my first experience with a tablet and Android OS, my expectations may have been lower than normal.  I am also hoping that the app market will improve over time.  I know I could root the OS, but for the time being I will just stick with what it came with.  To sum it up, I got what I paid for and am very happy (so far) with my NC",5
"Purchased the Nook Color over a month ago.  I have been reading alot more since I got it , as it's so convenient to take everywhere.  I have not had any issues reading in the car on sunny days.  I also like the ability to read at night in my bed without any lights on, thus minimizing chances of waking up the wife.  The screen is very sharp and easy to read.  Magazines look awesome on the Nook Color and it's so much more convenient than having a stack of magazines clutter up the house.  I do not think it would be easy to read on the beach under direct sunlight, but it will be fine if you are under an umbrella (which is what I do when at the beach, as I'm cancer phobic). Wi-fi connection is automatic , seamless.  The web browser is better than I expected - and I use it often to read online newspapers and check email (way better than the Kindle's browser).There is to be a sofware upgrade in the next month or so which will enhance the NC even more.  Or you can root it yourself to turn it into a full blown tablet (at half the price of the Galaxy tablet!)The only drawback is the weight of the NC - it weights about the same as a hard cover book (though easier to hold than a hard cover book).",5
The on-off button is located so that you will frequently turn off tbe machine by accident. The power button should be recessed. Same for volumn control.,3
exactly what my daughter wanted.  she is more than tickled with this reader.  She will use it for hours and hours,5
"i bought this with my brother for Father's Day. I tried to help him use the product thinking that i'm a reasonably educated person.The main problem that we had was trying to read Google ebooks in pdf format. I tried different methods. Downloading directly didn't work. And they will tell you this too as their help desk told me. And downloading it from a pc and transferring it.Even after going to a Nook kiosk, they were unable to figure it out and they even called tech support. Apparently they just don't work.This whole process of trying to get pdf ebooks to work was soo frustrating.Other huge negatives. Not very responsive and poor battery life for something that doesn't doo much for you and isn't that simple to use.My advice. Get a refurbished iPad. You'll be happier for the small price premium over a nook color. It does so much more and is worth the price.",2
"I was instantly the hero for my wife this Christmas, when I surprised her with a nook color under the tree. The device has great aesthetics, with a 7 inch IPS LCD display that is one of the most pleasing I've ever laid my eyes on, a thin and sleek profile, wonderful packaging, and nice support from Barnes and Noble, but that as Paul Harvey would say is only the beginning, this review is about the rest of the story.  At first glance this appears like just another eReader, but with a color screen for magazines and children's books swapped in for the normal eInk, but there is something different lurking beneath.  This device runs android 2.1 under the hood, heavily modified as it may be out of the box, and with that choice of operating system comes a potential access a world of hackery that is well beyond the reach of any other eReader.  In order to access this world you need to be willing to educate yourself a bit and root this device.  The process is actually quite simple (go to XDA-Developers forums or nookdevs.com Nook Color portal to read about it), and despite the dire warning disclaimers quite foolproof, and fully reversible (just in case you need warranty service).Once rooted, the device gains access to android market, where you can get thousands of apps, games, and tools for free (legally), or for a small purchase price.  Compared to the currently empty nook app store, the android market is bursting with exciting activity.  A rooted nook color gets access to the kindle app, so you can basically read all your amazon purchases on this device too.  Sony Reader app is coming soon from what I've heard, so you are probably going to get support for that store too.  Tied to the Kobo ecosystem, to borrow a phrase, there is an app for that.  Emulators for old game consoles are working nicely.  Playing Angry Birds on a 7 inch tablet is so much more fun than on a tiny 4 inch phone.  Stock browser lacks pinch to zoom, download Dolphin HD, and there you go.  Can't put app shortcuts and widgets on the home screen, home switcher and one of the freeware launchers (ADW is pretty nice) got your back.  A rooted nook color becomes something of a worthy competitor to the much more expensive iPad and Galaxy Tab.  Unlike real android phones and tablets, this does lack the physical menu, back, and search buttons, but a software softkey is installed upon rooting, so there are functional on-screen virtual equivalents to do the job.Don't get me wrong, there are some things that won't work, as nook color lacks a 3G radio, camera, or GPS.  The ROM is also a heavily modified version, so some abilities have been stripped out, and won't be available until a true custom ROM is available.  But more apps a likely to work than not due to a capable processor, ample storage packed underneath, and most importantly a talented and dedicated hacking community willing to experiment with their device and then educate others.  This is still early in the development life cycle of the nook color, so their are some rough edges to the process, some things will require resorting to the command line to fix.  Considering what you get for the money, this is probably the best handheld portable device on the market today.  An instant game changer without a doubt.",5
"Once I replace it's crippled version of Android OS, and replaced it with a Cyanogenmod version of Android, I found the tablet to be very capable. The only negative is that it is a little on the heavy side.",4
"I finally was convinced that I could enjoy an eBook reader, did my research, and settled on the Nook Color.  My goal was to be able to carry a few books around for pleasure, maybe even some business documents.  Even though I have an iPhone, I thought I would diversify and go after an Android based platform.  I figured that even if I decided to go with the iPad eventually I could use the Nook app on the iPad to read the books that I've bought.After a few weeks of using it, I'm close to handing it over to the kids or jailbreaking it for experimentation with Android, and getting an iPad.1) The quality is low.  The software is buggy, ironically one of the buggiest parts is trying to buy a book, where it more often than not hangs after a purchase with the download in limbo.  The battery charge socket seems to be flakey, so that often the unit gets confused about whether it is charging or now.2) Can't buy books when you're outside the US.  So, on an international business trip - when it'd be nice to pick up a few books for the plane or to pass time in a cafe - one can't buy a book.  That sucks.3) Although in theory I could load a bunch of PDF documents onto it for reading, the display is too small for them.  The interface for PDF documents, in terms of adjusting fonts, scrolling, is very limited.  Device is useless for this.4) The book selection is slim.  I don't think my tastes are that obscure, but I'm not interested in the mass market.  Forget pulling out old sci fi classics.  Forget getting a textbook.  And I find that some of the books that I would like to read are available for the Kindle but not the Nook.5) The iPhone Nook app is super buggy.  In theory it should let me sync, get my books on the iPhone too.  But the iPhone app just hangs and doesn't sync to my account, even after a reinstall.  If you read the reviews of the Nook app on the app store, they're all saying this.6) The App selection is slim.  Email doesn't work with outlook and there's no VPN support.Better to just get an iPad, clearly.",2
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my Nook Color. One of the main reasons I'm so happy with it is because I purchased the micro SD card that turns your Nook from an e-reader into an Android tablet. It works perfectly! Now I can enjoy the Nook ebooks but also have access to all the Android apps and features.,5
"I purchased my nook color in june of 2012. i had been online looking at various e-readers and comparing the features. i finally decided on the Nook color.**pros**-beautiful screen-very responsive touch screen-excellent battery life (you must leave the wi-fi off unless you are using it)-good overall feel to the device..seems solid and fits nice in your hands.-pretty decent web browsing (youtube etc)-custom sized text sizes, (you can go from Small to very large)-expansion micro sd card slot, (supports up to 32gb) for music, documents etc, note you CANNNOT Store e-books purchased from bn.com on the card!**cons**-diffcult to read in direct sunlight, (due to the technology used for the color display)-books CAN Be expensive, but are generally slightly less than retail, no physical book means you don't have tons of read books cosuming space around your home.-nearly have to pay for ALL APPS, (angry birds, etc)-Wimpy single speaker that is HARD to hear even with volume turned all the way up- if no screen protector is put on this device, you will have greasy smudges and fingerprints galore. invest in a good screen protector i would suggest the 2X caseen Glareshatter. here is the link: [...]-sometimes the nook color will freeze, prompting you to restart.also, you will want to purchase a cover for the nook color to keep it from getting scratched, or banged up here is the link to the black moko case i have.[...]Considering what it does, it is a great device, its not a $800.00 ipad, so if you purchase this with the expectation of it functioning like an ipad YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. this is a nice color e-reader with basic web browsing, email reading and sending capabilites, so if you wanna check your email and do some light web browising, this is for you. the battery life is amazing, but this is only true if you KEEP THE WIFI OFF. if your wifi is left on, and your not using it, battery life will be short. i only turn on wifi when im downloading a new book (takes about 30 seconds) and when im doing email or web browsing. the web browsing feature is ok, but no subsititue for your desktop or notebook. just keep this in mind.all in all, a good purchase, very pleased with my nook color!update 11/15/13*** e-reader seems to be performing well.if you LEAVE THE WIFI OFF you can get very long battery life.this device was great for its time, but since being released back in 2010 better things have come out.its fine for reading..but not much else.",4
"I've owned the Sony PRS-500, Kindle 1, 2 & 3, Sony PRS-350SC and the Nook Color. Each one has advantages, but none more than the B&N; Nook Color. Hold the Nook in your hand and you hold a reader, tablet PC, MP3 player, and photo viewer. It seems like it should be a work-out, but no so. With an optional leather cover (many cool choices at B&N;'s site) it weighs in at about a pound. Heavier than the Kindle? Sure, but also does so much more.The features that make this a stand-out are the 7"" color touch screen, full keyboard, and Android-based browser. The browser is a MAC, so Flash video is not supported, but all others are. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, email and everything else appears just as it does on your PC. Page turns are an effortless swipe on the screen.Two things I consider drawbacks are, first and foremost, the battery life. Don't expect more than 7 or 8 hours. B&N; says 10 days, but that's in hibernation mode. That drawback is kind of big. I'm forever charging the Nook, and charge time is 4-5 hours. The other drawback is backlighting, which is unfortunate but necessary for the brilliant color screen. Adust the page color in ""Settings"" and reduce the eye-strain.Aside from the battery life, the Nook Color is the best thing going out there. You'll enjoy carrying up to 8,000 books (with added SD memory card), staying connected with Wi-Fi, and it all comes to life on the long-overdue color touchscreen. Open, connect, enjoy.",5
"Ordered the e Reader for Christmas last year. As of today, my daughter is using it and loving it. She says, no regret she loves it.",5
"I initially purchase the Nook Color last year as a cheap alternative for a web device to check email and surf and read a few books now and then when not lugging my laptop around.  When they upgraded and opened the Android capabilities it became an Android Table PC with dedicated email app and improved web goodies.  At last check they now have 366 apps and growing, most are kid stuff and games but do have some useful apps for weather, calendar, note taking, Flight checker, etc.  I can transfer Word, Excel, photos and music to it and learn more each time I mess with it.The one thing missing was a 3G capability of the black n white version.  Both 3G and Bluetooth are built into the guts but who knows if and when they will be turned on.  My solution is Virgin Mobiles Broadband2Go MiFi wireless that supports up to 5 connections.  You can use it for as little as 10 bucks for 10 days or 20 bucks for a month and more options.  I've used the USB version as a backup when traveling for about 3 years so felt OK with the WiFi version.  Works fine with the Nook, did have to use `Forget' and reconnect the first time but now have a fall back `secure' WiFi connection.Doesn't have some of the fancy features of bigger better and more costly Table PCs but for everyday email and surfing, ez to carry around with a nice cover, enough apps to suit in general with more to come it more than meets my needs and NO monthly bills to use it.",4
"Not quite a full-fledged tablet, not a dedicated e-reader...and that's OK with me for $249!  I had my first two NookColors replaced, the first due to a SD card holder spring that failed after 90 days and the second due to an unresponsive touch screen and problems with powering on.  Customer service had me on the phone for about 45 minutes and took me through two factory re-sets before I finally convinced them to replace my second unit.  Note that all replacements of defective devices are re-furbished, not new.  Finally, I am experiencing what Barnes & Noble had in mind.  NookColor #3 works great and now that I have a unit with a touch screen that works as it should I am finally realizing what a great little machine this can be, with a really solid e-reader and nice add's like Pandora and other apps, as well as wi-fi web browsing that really works well for a function that is secondary to the NookColor's primary role as an e-reader.  I really appreciate being able to listen to any selection from my iTunes library straight off the SD Card while reading or surfing the web or playing around with a couple of the apps I bought. Standard quality MP4 video files play smoothly, and most were converted to that format via third party software on my PC (My VideoConverter). The app store is still under-developed and I really wish this had 3G capability so I'd have an excuse for taking it with me more often, but at such a low price compared to 3G tablets, I have become very enamored of this machine.  The questionable quality control, a screen that is reflective in bright light and the weight of the device with cover are my only complaints, and if I had not encountered the quality problems I mentioned this would have been a solid 4- or 5-Star review, especially considering the price vs. competing tablets (because it really is in the tablet category, especially with Android 2.2 froyo installed).",3
I have had my Nook Color for about three months now and I must say it has been one of the easiest devices to root.  This is a great bargain for $249 once you turn it into a full fledged Android tablet.  Forget about Nooky Froyo and go directly for Cyanogen mod).  You can then install the B&N Nook reader app and Amazon's own Kindle App (along with 1000's of other apps like Angry Birds).,5
"We bought two of these - the amount of reading we're doing has significantly increased. Since it is epub compatible, we can borrow from the library, download from guthenberg and google, as well as purchase from bookstores. The screen is bright and visible in the sun. Wireless N connectivity is fast and easy. Web browsing is fast and useful. PDF, MS Office document viewers work well. Battery life is surprisingly good.  We have two of these and an ipad - the Nook Color is what we're tending to use - mainly because of the size and weight. The ipad's chiefly used as an expensive toy.Barnes and Noble bet the farm on this device and it paid off.",5
"I think that all international customers should be forewarned that Barnes and Noble prevents you from being able to purchase any books online from their bookstore, you will be sent emails stating that books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States. This is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the United States (even by Barnes & Noble themselves as this is the same card that I used to pay for my B&N; membership) and despite even giving them my US postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for  by a real person.The thing that angers me the most is that I explained to Barnes & Noble (via phone) that I live in Trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books, but after purchasing a Nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors, a leather case and a 32 gig Sandisk memory card (all bought on Amazon), I have not been able to purchase a single book.If International Customers are not welcome, there should at least be some type of warning on their website. I feel like I was ripped-off by Barnes & Noble, and the sad thing about it is that I bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife. Shame on Barnes & Noble, that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale, my money was good enough for them but I am not good enough for their product. Now I have this New Nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust.It is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar.The real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the Barnes & Noble website for the purpose of purchasing books, they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as I am concerned, they have lost this customer permanently.P.S. This review has nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon.com, my gripe is with Barnes & Noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about International Customers.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)In the interest of fairness to Barnes & Noble and giving you Amazon.com community 100% reliable information I decided to open an account with a bank that's based in the USA to see if B&N; would be able to access the funds from that account, I'm trying to find out whether it's a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure.I decided to try this little experiment because I just can't understand how I can gain access to sample books from B&N; but every time I try to purchase one there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).I now have a Bank Of America Visa Debit Card which I have not tried as yet, it is possible that the issue with Barnes & Noble is that they cannot access funds from my Scotia Master Card which is based in Trinidad so I will give the Bank Of America card a try seeing that it's based in the USA and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my Pay Pal account. I'll post an update as to whether it worked or not.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)I'm sorry for taking so long but anyway, let us get on with it.  As I said before, every time I tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).Well I found out that IT IS POSSIBLE to purchase books on the Nook once you are using a US based card. I was not able to purchase books using my Scotia Master Card but I had no problem whatsoever when using my Bank of America Visa Card, so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location, or IP address. The only issue that I see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a US Bank Card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via PayPal.I have noticed that there are some US based sellers that have problems accessing funds from Trinidad based Credit Cards, some even have problems accessing funds from US based Cards although they are also in the US themselves, in cases like this I've found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via PayPal. I've never had any issue when paying via PayPal, even when other forms of payment could not work.I hope that this helps a little.",1
I bought this used but I was pleasantly surprised that it was like new. I rooted it and made itA Droid pad. I'm using it right now to write this. I like it better than my ipad.,5
"I am new to nook color and bought over 40 books on the day I purchased the device, naively thinking that all Publishers adhered to the text size options available within nook (the 6 letter 'A' images incrementing from very small to the largest). Much to my dismay when I later had time to go through all of the books I'd purchased and play with text sizing and font options, I found that this was not the case. Indeed, the maximum size for many of the texts was too small to be read by people with visual impairments.My plea to Barnes & Noble, Publishers, Amazon and other vendors who produce ebooks is to please keep pepole with visual disabilities in mind and adhere to standards that will meet various needs. In the US alone, there are millions of partially sighted people who need for text to be enlarged, made bold, underlined, etc. My feeling is that 'corrected' versions of these books should be released and people who have already purchased them should be given the option to get free download replacements.Personally, I have visually impaired people in my family and I will no longer purchase any book that does not at least allow for larger text sizes.Nook color is a great device but in the end it is only as good as the software and texts that is uses, so for now I rate it 3 stars until the above issues are addressed and implemented. I know I speak for many, and thank you for your time and consideration.",3
"Bought two of these for my daughters and they both have issues when reading books. The pages jump after a few minutes of reading and the menu screens pop up and down constantly. Power off and on to resolve but it keeps happening. I'm returning these today and getting a Kindle. Oh yeah and it locks up totally every so often and again you have to power it down, very disappointed. Barnes and noble support is terrible",1
I purchased for my wife as a gift and she loves it. Product met all of her needs and  she loves being able to just select a book and download it without any hassle. Battery lasts a good amount of time and I can now sleep at night without a flashlight beaming in my face on accident!,5
"It'll be gone soon, and I can't say I'll miss it. Our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so I got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the Kindle Color Nook. It doesn't overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as Our Kindle Fire's. Text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy. ONE advantage the Nook has over the Fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the Fire's percent of book read. Mrs. Spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percents.My wife and I are both comfortable navigating the Fire and barely had to refer to the owner's e manual. I don't like moving around on the Nook, and that may be solely because I'd become used to the ease of the Fire. Trying to surf the web on the Nook was very frustrating, and watching movies or video clips on the Nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion, slow responses, and freezes. We watch free TV shows on the Kindle Fire with smooth enjoyment.The Fire was a gift to my wife from me. She loves it. If I were to buy a small device for reading, I'd prefer to  buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads. That method may preclude the ability to get free books (it does on the Kindle), but it's a circumstance I'd accept.In summary, the Color Nook is pretty good as a reader. Those with children might be intrigued by the animation capacity of the Nook on some children's books and the option to have the book read aloud by the Nook voice. As a web browser, the Nook , in my experience, doesn't work as well as the Fire does.In choosing between the two devices, I chose the Fire because I prefer the Amazon site to B&N;'s, like the vast number of Kindle books on Amazon, and was totally persuaded by the vast array of  free books, movies, and TV shows that come with Amazon prime.",3
my girlfriend uses it every single day. i bought it for her as a christmas present. and she loves it.,5
"Very disappointed with this device:*) Touch screen is quirky, buggy and unpredictable.*) No way to get back to where you were if your finger happens to slip... very bad.*) Doesn't display side loaded DRM epub covers correctly.*) Freezes up fairly often, especially browser.*) When hooking up to a computer, files often get corrupted, device freezes after you restart, 'home' screen gets messed up, etc, power down button misbehaves...I've had to unregister and start from scratch 3 times already because of these issues.*) B/N hardline pop oriented marketing sucks.*) B/N bookstore misrepresents, mislabels books - show one cover, get a different book. You can end up paying for a Gutenberg press item that they displayed with a phoney commercial cover.*) Dictionary is limited in its vocabulary, and you can't access the dictionary by itself, nor does it link to other words or references.This is a compromised reader and a compromised tablet. I'm sorry I bought it. I've never used a Kindle (nor will I ever) but besides the Kindles, if you want a GOOD reader, get a Sony T1. If you want a tablet, buy a real tablet.",1
"I already had two of these in the household, but my son has been asking for his own since the first day I got mine. I am very pleased with the Nook Color as it does a wide range of functions. I have been able to do my university homework and write papers on mine, in addition to reading ebooks, .pdfs, and watching videos. My daughter reads, listens to music, and watches videos. My son will be making use of reading books for his age group and reading level, and watching instructional videos.",5
"The Nook Color is a reasonably priced device that will allow you to download multiple books and store them as well as access email.Right now it only has one book in it and has not been used for email since we have three computers readily accessible. I had a D-Link router which the Nook could never ""lock onto"" via wifi, so I changed the router to a Cisco, Linksyn which solved the wifi problem. Downlaoding books from Barnes & Noble is a little too easy once you set up an account with them and the books are somewhat expensive considering they are only electronic and intangible ($14.00 for a 300+ page book).",3
"I loved the nook. I eventually bought an ipad and gave this to my nephew, he still loves and uses it everyday.",5
I am dis-satisfied with b&n nook this product is only good at their site. and the choice of books and apps is poor compared to kindle,2
"I purchased a NOOKcolor a couple of months after it came out.  Within a week I had to return it because it would not charge.  A lot of hassle was required to get a replacement and it took a couple of weeks to get to me.  Once I got it set up I used it about 7 times and it locked up on the home page.  It took 2 days of conversing with a tech before they finally decided to send me another replacement.  I received my 3rd one and it lasted exactly 43 hours.  Screen went black and the lower right corner heated up to the point it was too hot to hold.  This time they were nicer about agreeing to send me a replacement.  The 4th one is sitting, unopened, in a box in front of me.  Well, after having trouble with three of them I no longer feel I can trust this device to work consistently (unless you consider always breaking as a form of consistency!) and would like to get a complete refund.  So far B&N; (the site I bought it from) won't do that for me.Moral(s) of the story:1. Stick with a Kindle - I bought an early version of it and still love it.  And if you want color go wtih the Kindle Fire.2. Only buy products though Amazon since they are very lenient and curteous about returns.  (They weren't selling the NOOKcolor when I purchased mine.)It's now about a year later and I'm still trying to get my money back.  My plan is to take this unopened box, all receipts and emails to a nearby B&N; store and hope pleading in person will get me a full refund.Wish me luck!",1
"I got this as a gift about 5 months ago.  It does a few things well, like being backlit so you can read it at night with no lights.  After that it is all downhill.  Battery life is about that of a really long life laptop.  At the store they told me not to expect anything better than 8 hours.  And if you are not connected to wifi like I was not at a cabin for 2 weeks you can't even set the time, there is no function to do that.  I mean really...  and if you want to archive a book you can't because that is only an on-line function.  Any files you add can only be deleted when connected to a laptop.  In bright sunlight it is barely visible unless you find some shade.  If you are not connected to wifi and your book expires, then the little book icon gives you a message that says ""The content is no longer available"".  What that content is remains a mystery to me and you cannot fix the error until you connect to wifi, after which it miraculously fixes itself.All in all this may be usable like a really slow laptop around the house, but for traveling its not worth lugging around.  Really, why even use it around the house when I have a fast laptop already that does a lot more.  This thing is just not ready for prime time, paper books beat it hands down.  Get a good LED book reader light and keep your $.I asked at the store if I could return it and they said only within the first 2 weeks with a receipt, so buyer beware...big time!",1
"Barnes & Noble NOOK COLOR eBook Reader Tablet (WiFi Only) w/ SanDisk 1GB microSD CardI won't get into all the things this amazing eReader can do. You can read all the other 5 star reviews for these details.But here's a really IMPORTANT one that shouldn't be overlooked when considering the purchase of an eReader.On the Nook, you can read THOUSANDS of FREE fiction and non-fiction books (from most local libraries) that are in the EPUB format.The Kindle cannot do this.",5
"The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc.  It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy.  A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own ""flavor"" of Android for this reader.  While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption.  As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan.  You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment).  Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).",3
"The new Nook ""Simple Touch"" is easy on my eyes for long reading sessions.  The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.  It is July in Texas...so I have not tried using it in direct sunlight.The Nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time.  Turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe.The battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize. At that point, it was using about 2% of the battery for each hour or two of reading.  Reading an hour or two hours a day and using the Wi-Fi an hour or two per week would result in 3 weeks or 4 weeks per charge.  In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.  The Nooks is at its best with a book with plain text, as illustrations, art, drawings, etc. look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.  Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.  My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the ""fine print"" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.  If you will be reading books, you will like the NOOK Simple Touch. Look around and compare price...the price of the Nook varies widely between stores.",4
"I bought three of these. I was very very happy of the performance with the original 1.0.1 firmware. However, two of them already upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware, which immediately erased the ability to use the ""look"" functions as internet browser.One of the readers frost during update and it doesn't recognize the ""nook"" menu button anymore...I will return it, luckily it is within the original retail return period.The second reader seems OK. It is less responsive now though, after the ""upgrade""...Will test it with imported through Callibre books tonight, if it is still OK after firmware update.The third reader hasn't updated yet, I don't know why. I will return it anyway - I don't want to take the risk.Conclusion: B&N; completely ruined otherwise not bad reader by buggy and restrictive firmware update. It is definitely not worth the money right now.I have the first generation Nook too, and in general I preferred Nook due to the epub support. I integrated with Callibre and used embedded fonts for non-Latin epub books.I promoted my Nook readers to friends until this firmware update, because of the OK hardware and epub support. However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device. It is OK if given free for a brand new unit.",2
"I recently bought a Nook and when I bought it home for the first time, I was impressed. The user interphase (much improved over Nook 1st gen) was optimized for the large touchscreen and is much better than the simple list UI of the new Kindle touch. Holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the Kindle touch desperately lacks. Hardware and software wise, the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use e-Reader.However, when I started to look for books to purchase (they were about investing if you were curious), out of the five books I tried to find, I ended up only being able to find one of the books I wanted. I purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews, and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for Amazon and Barnes and Noble are, but the truth is, B&N; still has a ways to go.I am aware the the Nook supports e-pub which allows it to read generic pdf files (something that the Kindle can't do), but one of the features I look for in e-readers is convenience. Having to buy a book from Google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my Nook is not convenient. If only this device had the Kindle store on it...Bottom line: When you buy an e-reader, you're also buying into the manufacturer's entire ecosystem. With the Kindle, you're buying material from an expanding and reliable retailer that's not going away anytime soon. With the Nook, you're buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the e-reader space.Two word recommendation: Research selection (before purchase)I hope I've helped.",3
"I am so pleased with my new Nook Touch. I have already purchased 4 books and am reading them all. The best part is that there are so many good books that are free ( even one OT/NT free Bible)and most others are under $10. There is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the Nook has Wi-Fi.I really like everything about it, especially the fact that there is a battery that can be changed by B&N; or by me after the warranty is out and the ability to visit B&N; store for help.I would highly recommend.",5
"For what I wanted it to do, namely display some of the pdf files and books that I already have on hand, this does a pretty poor job of it. The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the ""top 100"" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work. The battery capacity went down 20% over 4 days, so I don't think that it would make the 2 month mark that it should have.For all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device. Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default. The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N; were just being lazy when putting it together. Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software. I would rate this as 4/5 if it came unlocked by default.",2
"Haven't had it but a few weeks, but I am learning how to download from the library, etc.  love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere.  No operating problems so far.  Would recommend it for home or away&#34;",5
"Product shipped quickly, and arrived slightly ahead of schedule, even from the other side of out country.The stated storage capacity is rather misleading. It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N;'s ebooks. That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.Fortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5. Even better, memory card integration is seamless.Amazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue.I got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.The last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files. However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason.All in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it.",5
"Here's my take on NST:  This is a very nice, but very limited reader.  I LOVE THE DISPLAY.  That's it.  A real home run?  Not quite...Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  That's a win-win.So, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?  Three strikes (it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book).  This whole e-reader thing is bravo-sierra at this point.That's my $0.02.  Just wish I had known this before I spent the hundred dollars.",1
"OK, I got this thing and plugged it in as instructed, to which it responded by doing Nothing.  After some further research, I found that it likes to be updated.  I followed the instructions on the Nook website and downloaded the newest version and ... Nothing.  The little monster came back just as dumb as before.  It does show cute screens, but not yet anything productive.  So far, Not Impressed.",2
I bought this from B & N and had to return it back in June and they have still not credited me for the return.  I have called them at least ten times over the past two months and have been on the phone at least two to thee hours each time and they have still not credited me yet for the nook touch.  I am now forced to report it to my credit card company and hopefully they can get some where with them.  Buyer beware where you buy your Nook touch.,3
"I must admit I was a skeptic regarding ebooks. I thought nothing could beat a good ole paperback in my hand. after purchasing 2 of these for my wife and I on a whim I have to admit, I love it.Allows me to read books more quickly,not sure why, faster page turning, easier to find where you left off, maybe easier to read for longer periods of time, easier to carry with you anywhere maybe?.Adjustable font size so you don't have to squint at small print, display is just like a real page, and you can flip pages with a swipe, a touch, or using the buttons on either side. I can't compare it to a Kindle because I never owned one, but my understanding is that it allows more formats than the kindle does.so simple to transfer books from my computer, or purchase books via WIFI at B&N; or at home, or even borrow from my local library online!can't say enough great things about it, my wife and I were thrilled with them, not really any cons, wifi is difficult to connect in some places, thats pretty much it",5
"I purchased the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and the original Nook (the B&W; one) and tried them out during the return period. While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N;'s website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N; and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the ""Shop"" tab to access B&Ns; website.  Every Friday B&N; offers a free book for download, and has discounts on other days of the week.",5
"the reason ill take a eInk reader over a kindle eInk reader,  is because the nook has expandable memory (up to 32GB). when you get to the fire and nook color/tab its a different story. the simple touch is light weight and the battery life is amazing. if you just need an eReader with out browsing the web this is perfect. feels great in the hand, the screen size is just right and loading books are very easy. although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light.the only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another. i believe its because of the eInk style.",5
"(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; ""Block"" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode... I don't understand why :(- No Web Browser or RSS reader app or something like that- PDF reader usually do not render properly if the pdf has Tables, Bullets, Images and other graphic different from text.- You Can Not Delete, move or rename Files from the device User Interface, you always have to connect it to the computer to do this actions... this makes you waist a lot of time.- The device has a hidden partition used to store the books you purchased at B&N; store. You cannot have access to that partition (with or without computer) in order to delete this purchased books.- You can not export your Highlight or Notes from the books. Kindle is a step forward with this ""most have"" feature.- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness. Remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device!!- The Home screen lacks the options for fold or expand the 3 sections: Reading now, library and Next Readings.",3
"I have had this a few days and I love it! It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus! I have never had a nook before so I'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press. Other than that, I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I'm on winter break from school!",5
"We have only been using the product for a couple of weeks now, but it is working great.  My wife and my daughter both love it and find it very easy to use.",5
"I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.",1
"Unboxed the Nook. Charged it up. Won't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will. And it won't work at all until you register it. Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue. I'm calling the B&N; tech people. If they can't fix it fast then this thing is going back. I didn't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook's technical problems. I have better things to do.Update: Customer service didn't help. Took it to Barnes & Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldn't look at it. I figured if the battery can't hold a charge for that long than I didn't want the device. The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping. This thing cost me time and money, a bad experience all  around. I'll never buy a B & N product again, certainly not from a third party seller.  I've ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony. Hopefully I'll have better luck",1
"We bought one of these for my mother-in-law hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use. It has been nothing but a pain. Her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library. This requires a process that involves going through hoops, a computer, and an Adobe ID and software. Having experience with an Amazon Kindle (the very basic one) and iPads with library books, this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my in-laws. What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook. There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself. Otherwise, it is nothing but frustrating.",1
"First let me qualify my comments.  If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.It is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.  If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.  I think Barnes and Noble has a winner here.",5
"I purchased 2 of these in November of 2011. We had a baby on the way and I anticipated lots of reading time. They were so inexpensive I got one for me & one for my wife.I find the reading experience with the Simple Touch great. The pearl e-ink display has great contrast, and pages turn pretty quickly. I keep the wifi off and battery life is really good. I don't think it's quite as good as BN claims (2 months reading time?) but I can go weeks without charging. I've only purchased a few books though the BN store, I mostly side-load them using Calibre, which works great.My wife doesn't read hers as much as I read mine, and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive. Holding down the ""n"" button on bottom-front while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life. It hasn't been a major issue though.I purchased aVerso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Blackand it works well for reading in low-light situations. The Simple Touch with GlowLight wasn't an option when I bought mine.Overall it's a great, versatile, light small e-reader.",4
"I just received this reader after returning a gifted Kindle.  Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.  I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.  It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.  Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).",5
"I'll make it simple. I loved my NOOK. I bring to school every single day and have sixty-plus books on there. It's great because it's light, it's portable(it fits in my pocket!), and most importantly, it has all my books at once. It can most definitely be read in direct sun, and I was pleasantly surprised that Barnes and Noble did not lie in the slightest when they advertised no glare. You can side load any pdf or epub file, as well as downloading books from the store. The book management is simply fantastic. The reading quality is also great because you can change font size as well as the font itself.However, on day I picked it up and I couldn't unlock it. I wasn't very worried, because the NOOK occasionally doesn't respond to touch because the infared sensors are blocked by dust and dirt. But it still wouldn't respond after cleaning it as well as five hard reboots, which were the only thing the BN support line could offer. I feel dissapointed but ordered the new Glowlight and hope that it will last longer, because it was just great while it lasted. I hope you have a better experience with your NOOK- if, that is, you decide to buy this older model.",3
"I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition, and I own a iPad. This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damageI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months",5
"The ""newest model"" is the Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight, and not this model.  It may be the newest without a light, but it's not the ""newest"".",4
"Great product, easy to use and set up--after comparing pros and cons this was the one for me. I especially liked that I could download books from my community library and other sites. I wasn't tied just to a brand name download. Shipped quickly too.",5
Satisfied with this purchase. The Nook was brand new in an open box. Works like a gem. Very happy customer!,5
"I bought this to replace a Sony PRS-300 that I thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning.  Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N; as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.  I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.  This was a very bad buy for me.  I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.  I did not know how good I had it with the Sony PRS-300 and will continue to use my Sony instead of the nook.  I don't recommend the nook at all.",2
"price: nook - cheaper or same price as kindle with ads.screen: nook (barely) - same screen nook software makes slightly better typeface.non-drm ebook format: nook - supports more popular epub vs kindle support of mobi.other document formats: kindle - supports .doc, .txt, & .rtf; nook doesn't.borrowing from library support: nook - better for now, but popularity of kindles and Amazon marketing may change that, time will tell if libraries start purchasing kindle only ebooks.other paid book sources: nook - can read books purchased from other ebooks stores like google, sony, etc. kindle can't.user interface: nookbells & whistles: kindle - text to speech is incredibly helpful for dyslexics and others. plays mp3s. x-ray is pretty cool.connectivity: kindle - for an additional $50 you can get a kindle with 3G.page turns: nook - slightly faster.",5
"Let just start off by saying that I have tried the Kindle and although an OK hardware device, the interface was terrible.  It felt like the early days of the internet, with textual interfaces, underlined words, fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate, and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device. We returned it within 3 days.Next we tried the original Nook Black&White;, and interface was much better, but the screen had poor contrast. (not the nice Pearl screen as the Kindle has)Enter Nook Touch.  WOW.  This thing has a top notch interface... they totally put their minds and heart into this one...  it is PERFECT.  Touchscreen makes a world of a difference, and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store, personal library, and more.  On-screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen, and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE.  The screen is the new Pearl, so it looks just as good as the Kindle, with the added benefit of touchscreen!The size?  PERFECT!  Not too big, not too small.  Very thin.  Well built.  Feels durable.All I can say is this is finally the ereader I've been waiting for...  excellent battery life, good Pearl screen, touchscreen, and perfect size.To boot, the price is dead on!  $139 with Wifi.  If it gets stolen, I am buying another one immediately!",5
"very very good value for this reader, and I am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away.  They immediately sent a replacement.  Immediately.",5
"This a second generation e-reader. By adding a 16 GB micro SD card, it can store more e-books than I'll ever own. Most of my books are in PDF format. It has trouble displaying charts or images and fails totally to display an e-book in PDF form that I bought from Forbes.com. All these books display properly in PDF readers available on personal computers.It's other weakness is that it has minimal documentation. The topics are covered but the explanaitons leave the user with a lot of questions.",3
Wife bought this for her elderly mother - but she couldn't quite get the hang of using it (tech challenged)... My wife has been using it instead and seems to like it pretty well... All is good :),4
"This is the third ebook reader I've used and definitely the best.  The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N; Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N; store.Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N; left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter ""library.""  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!I emailed B&N; Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked ""Publisher's Default"" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!",5
"Gave this to my granddaughter, who loves it.  She uses it all the time and loves the touch feature and ease of downloading.",5
"The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!)-install the Kindle app and you can read Kindle ebooks too-Put it in host mode to attach an external keyboard-Make sure to get the Home Button Savior app so you can switch back and forth between the B&N; reader and the rest of the device's functionality.I used these instructions:[Amazon removed my link.  Google ""Root Nook Touch Using TouchNooter & Install Go Launcher, NookColor Tools, Gmail, Market & YouTube"", it's the top link. ]I will be buying LOTS of these as gifts, and I'm going to root them all!  This is a perfect device for hackers and regular ebook readers too!What's a Kindle?  Never heard of it.",5
"I don't read a ton so I didn't want to pay a huge premium for an e-reader.  I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.  If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.",3
"I dont know why I bought this tablet, just only one day using it and I stored it in a place where it continues stored... I dont like the screen... it reflects light from many sources (sun, bulbs, etc) despite the type of technology used in the screen...the size is no convenient, I think a bigger one good be better... well, this is my opinion about this product...",1
"I have gone thru a lot of reviews of this eBook before ordering it, mainly due to its long battery life.Within a week, it got shipped home (excellent seller).However, the product itself is far from being a good eBook Reader.I have had two: one Kindle eBook reader (with keyboard) and one 10.2"" Android tablet that I used as a reader mainly.The Nook is cumbersome:THE BADS:1) the first thing it ask for is to read some kind of agreement, then click ACCEPT !!! (like I am installing a new software !!!)2) the second thing is to setup for a WIFI access, I have troubled to enter the password for my home wireless so it sits there for one day. Can't do anything until WIFI access is established.THE GOODS3) I went to a local B&N; store to get instant WIFI access which I did,THE BAD4) then create an account, enter my credit card number (why do I need to do this at this time). Should only ask when I first order something from B&N.;THE GOOD:5) now I can copy my eBook in PDF formats to it, this part is straightforward.THE BAD:6) I opened one of my PDF doc and it came up with a huge font size7) try to touch the screen to get to a menu allowing me to change font size, the menu appears, then quickly disappears. I was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there8) it took me a few mins before I can get the menu to be stable, then change to a smaller size. The text now reads fine. But the ""next page"" , ""previous page"" buttons are too hard to push, it takes a hard push to get it to work.9) I close the document and try to open another one, it won't open10) try to re-open the first one, not open eitherFrom this point on, it simply refused to open any document I have on it.11) I even convert one PDF to epub format (specifically target the Nook)  and load on it, does not open either. And the epub size is much larger than PDF size (i.e. I will have a lot less books on it).To me, this eBook is useless, so I am going to return it back today.And this is not due to (or lack of) my high tech proficiency (I develop firmware for ""firwmare operated"" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these ""Software/firmware"" operated gadgets quite well, have at least 5 GADGETS with very complicated functionalities at home, all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking, no problem at all).I have written quite a lot of product reviews on Amazon, most of the gave good rating because these products are good.I feel really frustrated with this one, the first bad review I wrote.My older two eBook readers work right of the box. Just copy the documents to it and open to read them.I will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!! I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing). Rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not work.Many users were lucky to get the ones that work (touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here), I was not and don't want to try my luck with it again.",1
"I bought this Nook Simple Touch on Amazon.com, but when I received it, the WiFi would not connect. I tried my home network as well as several WiFi hot spots around town. Barnes & Noble Customer Service was NO HELP, telling me that, since I did not purchase the Nook Simple Touch from B&N;, they could not help me, and suggesting that I needed to return it to the seller. I did return it, thinking it was damaged somehow, and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument (kudos to him and Amazon!).Later, I bought one from B&N;, and it had the same problem. Again, B&N; Customer Service was NO HELP, but did send a replacement. The replacement has the SAME PROBLEM and will NOT CONNECT to WiFi. Now, I'm arguing with B&N; for a full refund.Most of the reviews are glowing. But what they don't say is that B&N; has this WiFi connectivity problem very commonly with the Nook Simple Touch. Even the B&N; Forum has many references to the problem.I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem. Just beware.CAVEAT EMPTOR!",1
"This arrived as described, packaged well, and worked well. The only issue I have ever had with them is its not as user friendly as it could be. I had to go to online blogs to find the rest of the steps to download an eBook. Whether it was from Barnes and Noble or the library.",3
"I previously owned a Kindle and loved it, but it kept breaking.  I finally gave up in frustration after having it replaced 3 times in the first year.I bought the Nook Simple Touch to replace it, and am very satisfied with my purchase.To be honest, the Kindle is brighter and easier to read in less-than-perfect light.  However the Nook excels in nearly every other way.1) Nook is sturdily reliable.  I have had no failures with it whatsoever, although I carry it everywhere and use it daily.  I do have it in a protective case, but I had my Kindle in a protective case and it kept breaking anyway.  POINT:  NOOK.2) Nook Simple touch is smaller and lighter than the equivalent Kindle e-reader.  Nevertheless, screen-size is ample.3) Nook is responsive and seems faster at turning pages than Kindle.4) Books download in a blink and are immediately available.  This too seems faster than with my Kindle.5) There are some things I could do with my Kindle that I can't do with my Nook Simple Touch, but I don't miss those things.  I needed a simple e-reader that just plain works and Nook Simple Touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way WITHOUT ADS.  POINT: NOOK.Generally, if you are shopping for an inexpensive, simple e-reader, I strongly urge you to buy the Nook, and not the Kindle.  I have tried both, and prefer the Nook.",4
Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He didn't think he would use an e-reader.  The Nook is so easy to set up and use.  I have one too and we both read with them all the time.,5
I bought Nook on yard sell for 35$ in great condition .And only later I found how I was lucky.  I was a devoted reader of real books all my live and never thought that I will love ebook reader. What I love about Nook that I can change size of letters on ANY e books. For exemple. I download e book PD format I made on my computer for free on kindel reader and cant read e book because prints SO small its impossible to read.  On kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on Kindel store. But not e book you made by yourself. I could not find Russian e book on Kindle store i would love to read . So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.Just love this Nook!,5
"This is a great and simple eBook reader. It's light enough that I can hold it in one hand when reading, it's small enough that it's easy to take with me, the battery life is long enough that I forgot where I put the charger, and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain. It does one thing and does it well. Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc.",5
"I've had all the other Nook's and this is the first that I truly love.  The touch screen is accurate and quick, there is no reflection at all, page turns are quicker than the other Nooks.  It's very light, the archiving and rating process is much much easier.  Shopping is easier as well.  I'm in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook, now I love them equally.  Of all the Nooks, I think this is the best one, I love it.  I only wish it was 3g.  Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers.  When I read on this Nook (just like the other 2), it doesn't sync with online so when I then use my Iphone I'm not at my current page.  In this area, the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing.  I'm not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook.  I'm waiting patiently for M-Edge to release their new covers so that I can use my M-Edge light with both my Nook and Kindle.",5
"The device physically, is relatively good for the money.  There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N; system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.  By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.  The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N; is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N; altogether.I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.  Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!  Now that's what I call convenience.",2
"It seems to be a limited device, but it has potential  I think a good price it new should be about $55.00. I have one as a backup to my kindle P.W there are two pros ,the SD card slot and it can be rooted, but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted. Very very limited web browser no Facebook or anything useful, the browser on the the paperwhite is much better. It is a pretty well made device.It is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhite.",3
"Having previously owned a Kindle, I was not expecting that e-book readers had much improved over the last year. Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.Amazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently. While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format. The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books. Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to. What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.",5
"We have the old Nook reader, which we love. We purchased this Nook at target for the same price as Barnes and Noble and Amazon.This Nook is smaller, which is nice. It has a built in light, which is really nice. And, it is touch screen, which is awesome!The only flaw I see thus far is that you can't resize the letters. Apparently the letters are a standard size, I assume because of the size of the screen? Anyway, I would like to make them smaller so that I can read more before turning the page. However, that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new Nook tremendously.",4
While it doesn't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years. However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires. Even can play Angry Birds if you really wanted to.,4
"I have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it.  My mom owns a Kindle, one sister a Nook Color, another sister a 1st Edition Nook...so I've seen my fair share of e-readers.  I did the research before I bought.  I actually bought my dad a Kindle 3G for Father's Day.  But the light weight of the Nook Touch was great for me.  I have problems with my hands and their abilities, so after a full day of commuting, typing, and writing, they've reached their peak.  It was the right choice for me.",5
"My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.  Apparently, this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.  Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.  This is not the way to treat customers.  I am canceling all my pre-orders and I will try a different ereader.",1
"I tried to leave this review at barnesandnoble.com, but they never posted it. Oh well.The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N; store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs. Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best. (FYI: It's costs less on the B&N; website.)",5
"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Amazon.com. In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile ""buttons"" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.  I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks.",5
"I bought it and love it.The Good StuffThe UI is a lot better than the Kindle (I bought one for my brother, so I felt the difference between them), it's really confortable to hold and read, the touch is great for navigating between de UI, but the physical buttons are my choice, takes a little time to get used to it because they are not as sensitive as the Kindle ones (that are too sensitive, I mean the basic edition), but that's a good thing since I avoid turn pages accidentaly.The structure is lightweight and really confortable, unlike Kindle, the frame around the screen es wide enough to put my fingers on it to read (I have large hands), the grip is great thanks to the rubberized exterior. It's a pleasure to read on this thing.The Not so Good StuffNot sharing on sideloaded content. If I sideload a book from other store, the sharing option gets unavailable.Not that many formats. Just Pubs and PDF. I mostly read Pub files, but it would be great if they support other formats too.Not ""send to"" option. In kindle I fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless. This thing doesn't have a feature like that, so WiFi is not as usable as it is on the Kindle.Overall a great product, I liked it more than the Kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read, better ergonomics, and the UI makes it feel a lot better.",5
"This is an update from my initial review.This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal. It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was ""Take the money and run!"", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit ""just so"" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.;The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.",2
"Ordered for a freind. As far as I know, his daughter is happy with it. I guess you could call him.",5
"This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.  Now knowing these two VERY IMPORTANT points, I can enjoy my &#34;Nook 2&#34;.",4
"Its a good ereader.  How it compares to the kindle, I dunno I seen raves and complaints for both.For an ereader I love the nook.- battery life is awesome.  would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators.- the display looks great, even in direct sunlight more or less.- The simple touch looks cool, very simplistic. no buttons all touchscreen for the most part.- The extra $40 warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nook.covers anytype of damage from what I understand.- Not as many CCNA/cisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast.- No addswhat I dont like;- only comes with 200mb of internal memory.  You have to pick up a microSD card- Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it. Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see;- new screensavers for download- better support for PDF files- ability to read word doc- solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.",4
"I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best. Why? I'm convinced that if anyone prefers the Kindle its because they've never tried the Nook. Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.First the Nook feels better. It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant. It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident. Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from. Plus the size options all make sense. For instance on the Kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small I can't see why anyone would use them and to me it's a waste.Fourth the buttons are all well placed.Fifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own pictures.Go try one today. I'm fairly confident you'll love it.....unless you don't.",5
this thing was a paperweight from the mint I opened it. and the customer service is just awful. it wont let you go any father unless you register the device and since it would not let me do it I could not use it. went back to the Kindle,2
"At first I was torn between the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Paperwhite. I chose the Nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book. I had though that the Nook did not have a good dictionary function, but learned otherwise after it's purchase. All one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the Look Up option on the bottom menu displayed on the left.Sharp resolution, useful utilities, convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen. Lightweight, durable and well designed. Essay to download free books (I suggest Project Gutenberg). For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.I suggest that you purchase additional memory. Barnes and Noble only allocates 1/4 of a GIG out of 2GIG for your personal library from non Barnes and Noble books. One gig for software to run the Nook and 3/4 for books purchased from Barnes. The best buy for external memory is 8 GIG. I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price.",5
I was very hesitant to buy a book reader because I really like holding my books.  I changed my mind when I bought a bigger bookcase and filled up immediately.  This Nook is great.  It is so much lighter than my IPad to read with.  I find that I use it a lot.,5
"In my opinion, the Nook Simple Touch is the best e-reader on the market because... well... it's simple. No distractions of email or social media, it lets me immerse myself in a book and I love it!",5
Readability in Sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen; can't be beat! The blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine! I like the Android operation too.,5
"I bought the Nook Touch instead of the Kindle because it was on sale for $75, which is still alot to pay for something that can only be used to read books. I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N;, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.; If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!  Pros: I did like that it recharges in under 4 hours and that it has a very long battery life.",2
"I know Amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes:I used to have a Kindle 3. It was great. It made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things I would have liked to change. I wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller.When I saw the Nook Touch I thought that this is what my Kindle should be like. Well I decided to buy the Nook and I'm very, very pleased. I won't go into an in depth review of the device itself. You can find that just about anywhere. What I will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier. I love the on screen virtual keyboard (like the ipad) and the fact that it's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books......or does it??With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch (voids your warranty). Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of). I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen. Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app. I ran that app, logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch. The only thing missing is text to speech but I didn't use that feature anyway. Yes it has a web browser, email and all the other Android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device. That isn't why I did this. I wanted a device to read my Nook Books and Kindle books.I now have the best of both worlds.",5
"If you only want to read, this is fine. The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color. This model is only print and only black and white.",4
"Barnes and Noble hit one out of the park with this ereader! compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!",5
"I love reading, and in a lot of cases I found myself leaving a book at home because I didn't want to carry any heavy things. This is great! I put in a small 512MB card and now it holds ~50 books! I gave it 4 stars only because the dictionary function isn't very good. I think it has a literal copy of a dictionary, which means it doesn't explain the word fully but still doesn't allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window...",4
"I bought this ereader and the Amazon Kindle ereader at the same time, so I could compare both together. After about a week I gave the Amazon ereader to my nephew and I kept the Nook. I am left handed, so holding things in my left hand feels natural to me. I really like how this can be held in the left hand and still have access to forward and back page turn buttons. Also, I like that it has a touch screen in addition to the physical buttons as well to turn pages. Also, and this was the biggest reason I kept the Nook. It has a more natural feel in the hand to me. My thumb rest comfortably next to the screen will reading. Overall, in my opinion this is a better ereader then the others out there.",5
"No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service.  I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",1
good reader. uploads books fast. I do not do wifi on this because I have heard bad things about the updates. also has problems if hooked up to a computer will take the shelves away. I have a lot of books so this is a big bad thing for me. But still is good.,4
"Received this as a gift last Christmas (11 months ago). Manual claims that at a typical rate of reading, one should be able to use it for a month on one charge. My battery already lasts only 2 - 2 1/2 hrs on one charge before the unit won't start due to a low battery level, requiring recharging. This is either a false claim on the part of B & N or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality. I've used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years; if this thing suffers from a battery problem, then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality / lemon nicad rechargeables I use to encounter 25 years ago. Keep away.",2
"Personally, I'm a kindle fan. But I got the Nook to try out the ebook loan facilities from libraries. The layout and user interface is not as user friendly as the kindle, as on the kindle, pressing the home button brings us back to the library. On the Nook, the home button opens a menu, then you need to select the options. Also, if you sort the books by &#34;Recent&#34; it does not show the most recently read books in order, but still displays books in order of &#34;recently downloaded&#34;, not a useful function.But on a positive note, the Nook combines the touch facilities and button control (to turn the pages) of both the Kindle Touch & normal kindle. The borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your PC, then imported onto the Nook via Adobe Digital Editions. A bit of a hassle, but a good option which Kindles do not offer. Overall, it's a good companion to Kindle, especially if you wish to borrow library books.",5
"I need to buy a gift for my mother's birthday and I know she likes to read books while on break at her job. I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have, is a really despicable thing to do.If you don't mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card, and throwing money at it to read books, then the Barnes & Noble Nook is right for you. If you are looking for an easy to use Ereader for library ebooks, STAY AWAY!",1
"I loved my Nook very much, Its very comfortable to use . What I  love about Nook more than kindle , that I could pick any Russian book, magazine  on Internet download on my computer , convert to PD format and download on Nook + I could pick on Nook any size of letters for comfortable reading .. On Kindle you can make bigger size of letters only if you Bought ebook on Kindle store. Other PD format books have so small size of letters , only if you zoom text , which I find uncomfortable  Like I said with Nook no problem. Also touch screen work great too.",5
"My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.  Apparently, this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.  Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.  This is not the way to treat customers.  I am canceling all my pre-orders and going to a different ereader.",1
"I've owned the Nook Simple Touch for about a year now and for the most part I'm happy with it.  The rate it which the words draw on the screen is a little slow sometimes and about once a month it freezes up.  The only thing that unfreezes it is pushing the reset button for about 20 seconds.***Update*** About a month after the warranty expired, the screen froze up permanently.  I haven't been able to figure out anything that will make the touch screen work again and when I called tech support, the only advice they could give me was to do a hard reset which isn't working to unfreeze the screen anymore.  When it worked, I really liked it.  I just wish that it still worked.",3
"Aside from various problems with this since the beginning, now I have to charge this Nook every time I want to read. It is said to hold a charge for 8 weeks with the wifi off, but even if I only read for 10 minutes, the next day I have to charge it again because the battery is too low. I've tried 3 different chargers to no avail. Instructions say to leave the Nook on when not in use, so I do. It's absolutely maddening when I return home from a stressful day of work and just want to sit on my porch to read for a while to unwind and get some cool air - but no, I have to charge the fricking Nook AGAIN and can't use it outside until it's been charged for a long time - and then have to deal with this frustration the next time I want to read.This Nook is crap and the service by Barnes & Noble and the seller were both zero - no service whatsoever, with each party passing the responsibility onto the other.Also, why is it that although the Nook screen or buttons often have to be pressed very hard to turn a page, when the Nook is closed to carry to my car or somewhere the slightest pressure changes the page or screen so I have to remember or write down what page I left off at???This Nook takes all the joy out of reading.",1
"Bought this to replace a Sony have had for a couple years and am pleasantly surprised.Arrived on time and works beautifully.Only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating is that, for a basic ereader with WiFi, it should have had a basic browser instead of only connecting to the Nook store.",4
"I'll be writing this review in stages, as I hit stopping points.Lightweight, nice screen, cute, low-profile buttons around the rim.  Touch screen is about as responsive as my iphone 4s.  Includes cable that has a standard USB a jack that plugs into just about everything: the computer, my hub, and the standard variety of wall worts and car chargers.This device is hard directed for ""easy setup"".  Too hard.  There should be a way to accept the TOU and get to using the device.  Forcing wifi setup and registration is just bad planning.Wifi - This is the stupidest thing about this device.  Once you charge it up, you turn it on, it asks for you to agree to terms, then it goes through wifi setup.  Note, you must HAVE wifi, AND connect to it successfully for the setup process to continue.  At this time, I'm stuck.  I'm in a town with limited wifi options, so it's not like I can just select a local hotspot.  Until i register the device, I have a brick.I have an old Netgear Router 802.11g&b; with wep and wpa protection.  The nook is capable of wpa2 security, but managed the wep and wpa security pretty nicely.  Strange thing was that I could get past the password, but it still would not connect to the internet (I checked the setup with my iPhone and everything worked fine).  Customer service had very few answers and only about 3 steps for me to take to fix the problem.  I tiered up to the supervisor and managed to pry out of her that the Nook runs on an 802.1x EAP network.  Upon googling it, this looks like the same network that causes a lot of android problems.  Next step is to hunt down a public wifi and try again.However: As soon as the thing charged and turned on, it showed up on my desktop and I was able to upload screensavers, books, documents, etc.  The device has a VERY small available memory, (about 250Mb), so text only books can be loaded, but not large PDFs (I bought this to enjoy the Modernist Cuisine series, 300Mb+ PDFs).  I had an old version of Calibre that worked right away.I'll change this review and maybe the two stars rating once I have something more than an expensive SD card reader to play with.UPDATE (after a stop at Denny's)Okay, sure enough, Once in a local restaurant with free wifi, I was able to connect, register and start using my nook.  I made sure I had a couple books on it when I left, so I was able to read a chapter before I paid the check.In good light, this screen is beautiful.  The characters are crisp and clear, it's easy to read, and you can make several screen adjustments including a limited list of fonts, size and margins.  In lower light, the dark grey on light grey screen gets tougher to read than, say, a printed sheet of paper.  Still, in my apt with only a 60 watt light illuminating the room, it's still pretty easy to read.You get two choices on how the side buttons function.  Personally, I like the lower one turning the page forward; because I tend to hold it in the lower corner, cupped in my hand.  However, you can swipe the screen to turn pages, too.The OS on the nook is a little simpler than, say the kindle fire.  And maybe that's why I like it better.  On this device, books are books are books.  They can be epubs, pdfs, purchased or uploaded, they all go the same place, and they all end up in the same list.  Nothing grinds my gears more than having to look 2-3 places for things based on where you bought them, or some other phantom difference established by the designers (or worse, the marketing department - I'm looking at you Kindle).  The down side to this that if you have a large ebook library, you are pretty much stuck using the search function.  There doesn't seem to be a way to organize books any other way. [checking online....] Oh crap, they have this whole ""shelf"" system built in.  Damn, scratch that organizational thing, I'll get back to ya there.Screen Savers.Forget about those fancy things on your PC, the nook's idea of a screen saver is to place a picture on the screen when it sleeps.  The default is a bunch of pictures of famous authors.  nice, you can also choose nature scenes.  But, remember I said that you could upload directly to the nook?  Well, here ya go. Create a folder with the name of your screen saver set, upload some 800x600 pics (jpg/png formats) in portrait mode and Voila! You have your own custom set.  I went to nook.com and downloaded a bunch of Str Trek Geeky stuff at first, but then realized I could just take a few snapshots and convert them to 16 greys myself.  Now I have a folder of a dozen of MY pictures as the screen saver.  Very nice.  Kinda like having an image viewer as well.Calibre.Getting calibre to work with the device once it was working was a complete breeze.  I bought a 16gb micro SD on sale and added it.  The card mounts on the desktop separately, but calibre is all tuned up to read them correctly.  So, when you put stuff on the device, you have the option of loading it in main memory or on the card.  Come to think of it, a series of small cards could be another way to organize as well.  Put your SF collection on this card, classics on that one, etc.  Fun.Oh, also, once I got the registration completed at Denny's I went into settings and disconnected the wifi.  It's been operating in that mode ever since.  So, only that first time is needed.Adding two more stars for all the juicy goodness.  I'll play around with it a while and see if we can get it to 5.  No real serious problems yet.UpdatePDFs - Okay, so pretty much everything else that displays pdfs tries to incorporate the formatting of the document.  This strange little device actually reads the text (easiest way to save formatting = text + format), and produces it in standard format.  It's a little disorienting but it makes for a much more consistent reading experience.Micro SDI think my real problem with this device was getting a huge SD card for this then thinking I had to fill it with a whole library.  Bah!  Granted, those 6 really large PDFs need some room, but I could have fit them all on a 2 Gb card and still had plenty of room to spare.  *sigh*  All that room meant I could have 100s of books on the device.  Think: Tim Taylor "" More Power!"" {grunt grunt}Shelves.  The device keeps track of the shelves internally, so it's not like a document you could edit outside the device and use your computer's search function to organize.  you MUST go through your entire library, no search functions, one book at a time to add to shelves.  Great if you know what you're looking for, but not all sets start with Lord of the Rings 1: ....If you buy this, don't get an external card right away.  the onboard memory can hold a lot of stuff.  Shorter onboard lists mean you have less stress with shelves and such.I won't be exploring the B&N; store for a while (a Long while).  I have a massive library to work through first.  So look elsewhere for those reviews.  I've heard the store is mighty nice though.No ads, easy to use, a joy to read.  This, my final entry sees that last star moving up the device.  Take heed of the speedbumps I've experienced and enjoy this cute little reader.  Now, I just need a case.....  :)ANOTHER UPDATE: Months later and I've read a small library on this thing.  It's a delight.  but I still find myself avoiding PDFs a lot because of the disorientation.  Also: to the 2 people who did NOT find this review helpful - Bite me.  Leave a comment.",5
I bought this directly from barns and noble. I get books from the library on my computer and that works good. The battery life is very good and the screen is very responsive. This is better then the kindle because it has expandable memory and accepts all popular formats for eBooks. The one complaint I have is that when you read PDFs you do not get the dictionary features and some of the writing is weirdly spaced. That's not what I bought it for so it does not matter to me. It has survived many months in public high school so it is very durable. I have of course bought it a protective case though. Barns and Noble ebooks are cheaper then regular books by a couple of dollars.,5
"MORE UPDATES at the bottom of my review!My review includes details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.I was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got ""overdrive"", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook:- Nook(N) by barnes & noble- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com- Sony Reader Touch(ST)1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF, mobi and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.2. PRICE!N: 149 with wifiST: 169 NO WIFIK: 139 with wifi(or 189 with wifi and free 3G)While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.*You can now lend some books from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new ""lend me"" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two you cannot lend at all.*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of [...]+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen(the entire screen), it was slow to respond, very klunky and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.* all three have a built in dictionary, which I think is just awesome.*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.*Yet, the Nook is heavier by about 3 oz then the Kindle or Sony.*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.*And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I also bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. The nook is comfortable to hold with one hand. I like the using the touch screen to ""swipe"" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. One fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.Update Oct '10: A software update is coming in Nov:""dramatically increase page turn speed, customized B&N; Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.Update Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature.",5
"I absolutely love it. While it doesn't have the bells and whistles of the other Ebook Readers, it does exactly what it is meant to do. It allows you to read books. I bought this as gateway into ebook technology and I love it. The unit fits into your hands nicely and is not heavy. The buttons on the side are helpful in turning the pages. It charges fast and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.",5
I waited until June 2010 until I bought a nook. So far I am loving it. I love the page turning swipe feature. Those that gave the nook 1 star are the ones who got theirs with the 1.1 firmware. The firmware is now up to 1.4 and the price has dropped to $199.,5
"UPDATE 6/3/10:  B&N; is offering a $50 gift card with every purchase from June 2 =>.  They will honor purchases up to two weeks prior to the launch of the promotion.  I bought mine 5/22 and my gift card arrives in 10 business days!  Now that's what I call a customer-focused company with excellent customer service.  Another and very important reason why nook beats Kindle.nook review:I did my research on e-readers and thought long and hard about the two main contenders - nook and Kindle.  I chose the nook.  Why?...1) It's design is future-proof (as far as anything is) because the hardware is designed such that software and firmware updates can make it more functional in the future.  Kindle requires new hardware. I just read a new one will be out in August '10, and no, no touch screen!2) Amazon (Kindle) is not a dedicated book store whose sole livelihood is books, like B&N; (nook).  Amazon has demonstrated this with its wrangling with publishers to the dismay of both the publishers and Amazon's customers3) Yes, the nook was rushed out last year but they are now already on V1.3 software, but it works well and has added features and corrected some early flaws.  The page turns are now quicker and very acceptable, especially compared with a real book page turn.  Whoever you are with, they will have some problems and features you do or don't like.  There are supposedly more books via B&N;, but never the books you actually want to read - Kindle has some missing for me as well as B&N.;B&N; will no doubt keep updating its software regularly and Amazon make you pay for new Kindles (and risk you not being able to read your e-books on the next version, like V1 to V2)E-book pricing is a little crazy right now as publishers seem to be trying to establish the ""value"" of e-books versus paperback/hardcover.  Some e-books are more expensive and some are changing prices weekly.  It's the same situation with both Kindle and nook from what I can tell.4) The touch screen is a nice feature (future-proofed hardware), but big fingers can hit the wrong selection occasionally.  It is comparable with the iTouch touchscreen performance IMHO.  Navigation is maybe more hassle than the Kindle as a result.  This also makes the nook smaller (no physical keyboard to worry about) and easier to hold, even though it is marginally heavier than the Kindle.5) The nook can be personalized with your own photos for wallpaper and screen-savers (wrong wording as it's just a picture for when the nook is in sleep mode - No burn-in with e-ink screens). You can add more storage in a nook with a micro SD card6) The Kindle battery lasts longer, but the nook is fine with the Wi-Fi turned off - about 10 hours.  The nook battery is user-replaceable and costs just $29, unlike the Kindle7) The nook extended warranty covers ANY accidental breakage/spillage for the full 2 years.8) A B&N; store is always nearby to get help in person and they currently offer a free book per week when you visit the store (in week 2 of 5 right now)9) Using independent free software available on the web (Calibre), I can convert and ""sideload"" documents and news feeds to my nook.  I have sideloaded web pages (originally saved as HTML), word documents and .pdf's, all in .epub format.  This is no doubt possible with Kindle too, but the nook is more than flexible for my needs.  I read USA Today and The BBC news feeds on my nook every day and they include B&W; photos and diagrams which are clearly readable.  Calibre has many more available.10) Using Sigil, again free software, I can modify e-books to add chapters or correct errors and sideload them to my nook.  Again, no doubt a possibility with Kindle, but I am not sure.11)  Nook is just the one size, no Kindle DX equivalent.  For my needs though, the small nook is ""back pocket"" sized (literally fitting in my back pocket) and is small enough to read but carry around.  I need reading glasses without exception to read and so can read at the smallest text size with no problem.12)  I'm not bothered about having a music player and the built-in speakers are not really capable as listening devices (tinny and low volume), but it's there and will no doubt allow for text-to-speech in a future software release, which will be useful.  The sound quality through headphones is good.I've had my nook a week and have read two books and many daily news articles.  It's comfortable to use, it's fun to use and while maybe a luxury we could all do without, I've read a couple free e-books that otherwise, I would never have done - and I have many more downloaded and ready in the wings.  It's actually now a hassle to read through a real paperback or hardcover.  :-)The choice is yours, but my choice was the nook and I think it was a good choice.UPDATE 6/2/10 - .PDF's on the nookI have found that .pdf books, especially with charts and diagrams (ie technical/text books) are problematic to read on the nook.  Interestingly the B&N; store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a .pdf on the nook - maybe just a way to avoid the issue??  However, the Kindle will no doubt have the same issue, unless you use the DX which is larger and so you can read .pdf's natively.If you read a native .pdf on the nook it is the whole page squeezed down to the 5"" screen - impossible to read.  If you use Calibre to convert the .pdf to .epub format, then the end result is variable.  Diagrams get screwed up or disappear and while text can be enlarged with the font size function, even the text formatting may or may not be acceptable.Either way, I have given up trying to read such books on my nook.  :-(I would not recommend the nook to anyone trying to use it for school where .pdf's are the only format available.  The problem is not nook/Kindle, but the way .pdf's are created.  They don't have the necessary information encoded to be able to convert them to other e-reader formats and retain their .pdf look.  If you are going to save any documents for conversion to .epub format, don't use .pdf.  I have found saving as .HTML renders a perfectly acceptable .epub file when converted, including diagrams and charts when archiving web pages, for example.See also my review of the JAVOedge Snake Skin Case for Barnes & Nobles Nook (Flip Style)",4
"MY WIFE ADORES THIS PRODUCT !!It was our household's first e-reader.There IS a little learning curve at first and expect to need a household pc to talk to it via a usb micro (not MINI) data cable WITH DATA capability (some usb cables are just charge-only) and if you get a used deal on one without a usb micro data+power ability, you are looking at up to $20.00 (unless you get one cheaper taking a risk on a crappier cable).---Only thing is it's hard for someone whose disabled with touching or vision issues to use... though you can increase font size, the rare occasion you have to type something out it's kinda small but that doesn't happen often on the nook itself.----She uses hers mainly to check things out from the Clark County Library District in Las Vegas.  Once we registered with the Library, we installed Adobe Digital Editions which is the digital rights management... that took some doing but once in place, you tell the ADE of the nook you have, authorize it, and then from that point on anytime you want to check out a library book you simply go to their site, check out the electronic version which comes into your computer where the ADE recognizes it and outputs it to your nook.After x amount of days...when the checkout time expires, the file disables itself and you either get another book from the library or re check-in/check-out the same one for another x days.It makes the public library a whole new experience and that's great because, guess what...your tax dollars paid for it !  and the author gets their cut too.....Win-win all around....We've never bought an e-book from barnes and noble yet, and you do have to register the nook with them at first though you don't have to put in a credit card, but that step is probably skippable it's just handy because if you want help from b&n; they'll want you to at least register the product with them..not a big deal and it's one-time during your initial set-up procedures (and that's the one time you need to use the aforementioned little hard to type on 'typewriter' display.Happy Nooking(P.S.  as a bad pun, I told my wife that if The 3 Stooges owned it, it would be a Nook-Nook-Nook... but I was frowned at.  Guess it's funnier if Curley is your favorite stooge.  I digress :)  )",5
"This is the most fantastic device imaginable. It has traveled to England, Scotland, Turkey, Egypt and Qatar and has even taken a cruise! It has traveled around in a purse, a briefcase and a carryon. It has downloaded books in PDF as well as the e-pub format, from Barnes & Noble as well as other suppliers. It has borrowed and loaned books. It also gets automatic software updates and even accesses the web to check e-mail or the latest news. This is one device that will never disappoint.So easy to read. A big plus is that when you search for a subject on B&N;, once it has exhausted the B&N; offerings (some free!), it goes on to list all the Google Books in the same category. If you make selections of Google books those are downloaded exactly the same as paid selections. I love the way this all happens automatically. You don't have to do anything at all. You can also add audio books, other audio files. The approximately 1,500 book capacity plus the capability of adding more storage is another real plus.",5
"I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa, more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops. I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device, because of the reviews and also the SD card capability.My joy was short lived. During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf's that I have amassed over the years (over 30GB - I am a voracious reader). A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued, after which I decided to take the trip again (I live outside of the USA) to return the device directly to the store.Much to my surprise, they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues. I was refunded for all the items (Nook, cover case and screen protector) in no time at all.So, in summary, the Nook gets a ZERO star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader, but B&N; gets a FIVE star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service!",5
"So, I bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this, or buying the kindle.I bought the device with 3G simply because it was only a little more, and I travel a lot and don't have house wi-fi. I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B&N; and can't believe I ever did that! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore, with my nook and feel connected to the actual store. I will admit you have to do your research (read forums, articles etc...) because the nook demo employees, are not going to know everything. Also you MUST read the 'manual' and follow it to a 'T' Don't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you're going to have battery issues (needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity)A lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen' when actually the battery is drained, and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver, book page etc you were on when it died. There's no 'power-down' it will just stop, and touchscreen will not be active, once you plug it up and charge it a little, it will be good again. Also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster (obvious unfortunate fact)There are a lot of books available at the moment (depending what genre you read) especially for teen and sci-fi and fiction (my books), and I was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features' for a good portion of the books I was interested in. Also B&N; really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades (faster page turning, less freezing etc.)Also even when there was a manufacturing error, they were quick to send out a new improved nook. Overall, I love this device, it's fun, its sleek with a solid feel, and it's open-ended for future updates.It may be for you, it may not. Do your research, read forums and reviews, go into the respective stores and hold and try the device.Pros:Removable/replaceable batteryReally crisp 'paper' and 'words'e-wish list for booksSD card slotAudio/ musicFree coupons, discounts, and food monthly via nooke pub librarygetting books from Sony ADELending featureConsBattery lasts an average of 7-8 daystouchscreen keyboard a bit small (if you're used to iphone/ipod)touchscreen may be over sensitive with accidental touchSmall price differences with kindle books (average of a dollar)",5
"After what I thought was a thorough research between the Kindle, nook & Sony ereaders, I took the plunge & bought the nook. What appealled to me most were the web browser & ePub use to check out books from the library. However, after fully charging the nook, I took it with me for a weekend at the beach. I didn't bring the the charger because B&N; said battery would last up to 10 days with wireless off. Well, I found out the hard way, with wireless on, it barely a couple hours reading at night & in the afternoon by the beach. Oy, was I frustrated with nothing left to read & another night & afternoon left. Lesson learned: must bring charger everywhere! Lost 1 * for this.I'm not a fan of touch screens, still love my trusty push-button cellphone. So browsing the web was a pain for me, having to navigate around the screen with my finger. Page turning was fine, but I think I've overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant page-turning friction :0)). Scrolling down & up also frustrates me - most of the time I have to swipe several times to get it to move. Not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads - the response time was slow which made me think it didn't sense my touch, so I'd do it again & it goes back all the way to the main menu. Grrr! What a pain as I have to restart the store search & find the page again.B&N; samples are horrible! They give you 7 pages...but it's the cover, copyright, dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story. Not enough to make me want to buy a book. The closest B&N; is 1 hour drive away so I couldn't take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading in-store.After I discovered that I cannot organize books into folders, that was the final straw. I read novels with racy titles, my 10 y.o. son wanted to read his classics on the nook but I didn't want to lend it to him because he would see all my books & potentially read them. This is a biggie for me so lost another *.Features I'm happy with: I was able to check-out books from my library & I was able to put my pdf books on the nook. Yey! Unfortunately, my library just got into ebooks & have only a handfull of books so it'll be a while until I can fully take advantage of this feature.Well, these are my personal experiences with which I now realize that I didn't do a thorough reasearch as I first thought, LOL. My fault...but I still like my nook, though I'm no longer in love with it like when I first received it. I've also ordered the latest Kindle so we'll see which one I'll keep - I'm looking forward to the push-button keys on that, LOL.",3
".Paid $[...] for this in April 2010.  Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with ""free"" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N; with their service and nook product.For those who think this is a good product.  You are fools who don't know enough to make a valid judgment.  I laugh at you, because your nook will be dead within a year.",1
"After reading many technical and customer reviews of both the Nook and the Kindle, I purchased the Nook.  I think that both the Nook and Kindle are good products, but the Nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the Kindle. First, a buyer can actually test drive the Nook before purchasing it at either Best Buy or at a Barnes and Noble store. The Kindle is only available on line at Amazon.com.  I cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first. The physical design of the Nook is attractive, sturdy, and compact. Navigating is easy. The user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the Nook to turn the page of an ebook.  The pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen. Bookmarks can also be set. This is an important feature for me since I tend to read more than one book at a time. Secondly, the Nook offers web browsing.  I was able to link my Nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages.  Although the software is still in its beta stages, I am impressed at what I can already do.  Next, I can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the Nook. This might be a minor point, but it makes the Nook unique and customizable for its owner. The Nook's storage capacity can be expanded. The Nook comes with 2GB of storage that the user can expand up to 16GB by purchasing and installing a micro SD card. The Nook's internal battery lasts about five years with normal use (this is according to technical reviewers), and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user. Nook users also have a community forum they can join on the Barnes and Noble website to share ideas, tips, and news about the Nook. Also, improvements in the Nook software updates are due to customer input. I like for my suggestions to be heard and the Nook engineering team is listening. Don't take my word for it. Test drive the Nook for yourself before you make a decision.",5
"I'll admit up front that when I chose the Nook over Kindle and Sony's e-reader, I was impressed by that nifty full color touchscreen at the bottom of reading screen.  Glitz does not equal function, as I promptly found out.To be fair to Nook, if ALL you want to do is read, the device works, and works pleasantly.  I received my Nook in February, so it had the latest firmware updates, and I experienced none of the delays in downloading, missed sections of books, delays in page turning that early reports noted.  But if I was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons, OUCH!The nifty little full color touchscreen (NOT to be confused with the e-paper reading screen, which is permanently gray-scale) just can't do it's job.  It responds slowly and inconsistently to touch, is quirky in its response, and virtually (no pun intended) unusable.  The virtual keyboard:  what a nightmare.  It's a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error, and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragi-comedy in short order.The unit itself is pleasant to the hand, and comfortable.  It's also darn slick in its appearance, and if aesthetics  are your only criteria, well, go for it.  But here is why I returned the Nook after one week:  any optional feature, such as bookmarking, highlighting text and annotating it, search functions for previous book marks and annotations:  purely a nightmare.  The processor of the Nook appears to be vastly underpowered, and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable.  It took me 30 seconds, AFTER I got good at it, to highlight 3 lines at the bottom of a page.  Simply not acceptable.Battery life:  might have just been my own unit, but in 7 hours: dead.  I also experienced two full scale lockups, with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes.The Nook's only advantage, as far as I can tell, is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on Kindle.  Not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology, but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be FUNCTIONAL before you bring it to market.Update as of 2/11/2010:  I purchased a Kindle after returning my Nook, and have been using it for three days.  Wow.  What an incredible difference in terms of ease of use.  The keyboard is very functional, bookmarking and note taking is effortless, the dictionary function (move the cursor to a word, instantly a definition pops up) is wonderful. Battery consumption is imperceptible, after 3 day, no visible drain (my Nook lasted 7 hours).  Downside of the Kindle?  Books whose copyright had expired (e.g. Wuthering Heights)that were FREE on Nook, are 99 cents on Kindle.  Nook lists all vendors of a given book, with prices conveniently visible, Kindle does not.  Irritating.  Lastly, Nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen, which I found very useful.  Not available on Kindle.  Overall:  for my needs, no contest whatsoever: Kindle",1
"I did a lot of research on the different ebook Readers before purchasing my NOOK.  I went back and forth between Amazon's Kindle and B&N's NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library, Google Books, along with Barnes & Noble's selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive, but once I got the hang of it, it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK, which I have maybe a tiny bit of, but we're talking maybe a second or so, so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK, but to me it's a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local B&N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  B&N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.  The Kindle does not offer that kind of service.  All in all I am very happy with my NOOK and would recommend one to anyone looking for an ebook Reader.",5
"Despite all of the negative reviews, I decided to take a chance and buy the nook, once I tested it out at my local B&N.; I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility (epub format, book lending, etc).My nook arrived on January 28th. Since then, I've experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice, but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. I've also read three books in the space of a week, which is a personal record for me, as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback, longer if I'm reading an ebook on an LCD screen.The eInk technology is fabulous. I can read all day (and do) without eyestrain. The letters are very crisp on a plain white background. Even better, you can adjust the font size from small to extra large. Not only that but the nook comes with several fonts: Amasis, Helvetica Neue and Light Classic. I'm happy with the Amasis as it resembles Times Roman.My only complaint so far is that I am not able to categorize my books into categories. At the moment, I'm forced to wade through my list until I find the book that I want to read. B&N; has already sent out an update, which is a good improvement over the old interface. While the touch interface can be a bit buggy (Sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page.), I can turn pages in one second compared to the 2-3 seconds it would take with the original software. That wasn't a big deal until I received the upgrade.I also like what they've done with the bookmarks feature. Before, they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks. With this upgrade, it lists the page that you bookmarked, which is much nicer.I love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the B&N; site to do everything. Once you finish the sample, you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book, you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that you've read directly from your nook with the press of a button, which helps manage your list.Sideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience. However, you can't categorize your documents; you can only sort them by title or author.Another great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries (see [...] for a list of libraries near you), sideload books that you have bought from Fictionwise and other ebook stores, and download free ebooks from either the B&N; site or Google Books. That's what ultimately sold me on the nook, the versatility and freedom to choose where I want to buy or download free ebooks. The nook is not proprietary, unlike the Kindle and the soon-to-be-released iPad.The interface is very easy to use. It comes with a manual that you can read on the device, or on the B&N; website. If you're still stuck on an issue, I found this great forum ([...]) with friendly people who can help you.I've yet to check out the Lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology.Other than my issue with organization, I am really enjoying my nook. I'm looking forward to reading many books in the future, thanks to this wonderful device. Highly recommended.Side note: I agree with S. Dayton about the iPad. After reading a few ebooks on my iTouch and my Mac, I have to agree with him about the eyestrain. For casual surfing and watching video, LCD works fine. But for longterm reading, eInk is the way to go.",4
"I've researched the readers for about two years.I only buy electronics after I can give the item a test drive. Upon that note, I have always been a huge fan of Amazon.For the first time I could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in question.The nook was available to be put through anything I wanted to try. First of all the new Nook in stores has the most recent upgrades. No problem with turning the page at all,touch screen worked great. In the store I downdoaded a book in under 1 minute and have downloaded 3 books at home that are nearly 1000 pages long in under 1 minute.The nook can connect to your computer (as does the Sony). You can also download from other sources other than the dealer.The nook also downloads without any effort wi-fi ( as does the Kindle).The nook's battery you can change at home. It also accepts a memory card, which allows you to expand your book collection.The Nook also has other advantages,but I was only wanted a reliable reader.Barnes and Noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package.",5
"After MONTHS of research for my first ereader I finally decided on the Nook. With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.I highly recommend the Nook. With BN updates coming as quick as they are, I think this device is proving to be THE superior ereader.",5
"I purchased a Kindle for my wife last Christmas. She loves it and uses it more than any other gift I ever purchased her. She was having so much fun with it I decided to get an ereader for myself but I was drawn more toward the Nook. I read so many bad reviews about the Nook I wasn't sure if I should get it or a Kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection. I thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better. I decided to go for it. I ordered it last Wednesday from B&N; and received it 2 days later. I am so happy I did. I didn't experience any of the the negatives I read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer. Talking about the battery, it's nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a Kindle. I'll probably never need it but it's also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content. And the Nook just looks nicer in my opinion.The new update was released the same day I received my Nook and I updated the firmware the second day I had it and it runs even more smoother. I have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device. I had no problems what-so-ever navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for me.My wife still loves her Kindle but I think she is a little jealous. She asked me why I didn't get her a Nook for Christmas.I was completely in the dark about ereaders until just 2 months ago. I know during my research I found people that were experiencing  problems and were unhappy with every reader I checked into. If you were putting off getting a Nook because of bad reviews, I would give them another look. There has been 2 firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns. That's not bad for a device that was only released a short while ago. I'm sure there will be further updates as time goes on and it will get only better.~eddie",5
"I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The ""paper-white"" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The ""5 day battery life"" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor. Well, I don't like crippled, so I'll look elsewhere, thank you very much...",2
"I purchased the Kindle 1, then a BeBook (because it reads PDFs), and now a Kindle DX for the Text-To-Speech. The Nook looks so cool, until you own one. Heavy copy protection, even on PUBLIC DOMAIN books is ridiculous. And, from what I am reading on the web, the books are encoded with a person's credit card # and other personal info. So ... hackers can rejoice if I loose my Nook.Anyway, books are still cheaper on Amazon.The color touch screen is cool, until you realize that it takes up SOOOO much of the reading area and ... costs battery!Maybe next year, the nook will be ready for prime time.",1
"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!",5
"I got my Nook Wi-Fi/3G about 2 months ago, and I love it!  I researched ALOT of ereaders before making the decision to buy the Nook; in fact, I originally bought a Kindle from a local store, but never took it out of the box, and returned it to purchase the Nook.I originally decided to go with the 3G for two reasons; 1) I wasn't sure I could set up my home wi-fi to work with the Nook, and 2) I wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere.  And I've been glad I chose that; I have yet to purchase a book over just the wi-fi.  I was at a doctors office recently, waiting and waiting and waiting, and it was wonderful to be able to shop, buy a book, and start it while enduring the endless waiting.The customer service from Barnes and Noble is great, all I have to do is walk in the store with my Nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the Nook.  Also, the store nearest me has ""classes"" on Saturday afternoons for Nook/NookColor owners, and I found that to be very helpful when I first purchased my Nook.Speaking of the physical store, I also like that I can read any book for FREE for up to an hour a day in the store.  That gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a ""free sample"" and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or not.I've looked at the newest generation Nook, which has just recently become available, and I'm glad I got my Nook when I did; I like it so much better than ANY ereader I've looked at.  I can drop my nook in my purse, and anytime I'm stuck somewhere and want to read, I've got a whole library right there with me.  The Nook is awesome!!!",5
"Pros: Very nice display , clear than Sony Prs-600S. 5 Star for this.Cons: Touch screen not responsive, navigation is not good. It is a stupid to have two screen for read and menu. waste spaces. Software looks buggy, very irresponsive even if updated the firmware to latest 1.4.3., 2 star for this.Final star 3.",3
"I have been super happy with this reader.  In the bright sun sitting outside, no problem.  On the many flights I take, no problem.  B&N; site and downloading books is a breeze.  I've got a Droid X phone, and the accounts sync, so I can quickly pull up the same book on my phone with the Nook App, very cool.I can lend, and have others lend me, some of the books purchased.Our local library in Central Texas, outside Austin, is connected to Overdrive.com.  With my library card I can download epub books and check them out, anywhere I've got internet.  I don't have to check them back in, they just go away after the check out period.  Same with Audiobooks.  Nook handles this format, other eReaders do not, so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.I like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen, personally.  It is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen.  Seems like no big deal, but after 28 hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference.Not a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed.  This is a personal opinion, and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard.  I put in pagemarks etc on books, but don't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading.  If you do a lot of this, you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it.  I don't, the amount of typing is very limited, so onscreen is perfect and I'm used to it with my phones.Using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do, but it isn't the best.  You can in a pinch, but it's easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a website.The number of places to get books, especially free ones, is awesome with the Nook handling so many formats.  B&N; just search 0.00 and titles and you'll get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free.  gutenberg.org is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your Nook for free, google books does this and a few other sites.  Tons and Tons of books for free, I haven't read Tom Sawyer in 20+ years and am now, for free.  Just an addition to note.Lots of periodicals, newspapers etc, that you can get daily.I take my kids into B&N; and they love to look through the kids books.  While there, I can read any book over their Wifi for free for up to an hour.  I don't use this a lot, but once a month or so when I take the kids, it's pretty cool.Overall, I'm really pysched, this Nook has been awesome.",5
"Most of the other reviews have the details about what is good and bad in their opinion, and most of it is accurate. The battery life is misrepresented by B&N.; The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N; folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N.; Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be ""upgraded"" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N; upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N; will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T; with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library. I'll try not spill my soup on the NOOK while reading and eating -or it would become a SOUPER-NOOK.",3
"I bought the original nook in Aug. 2010. Initially, I liked it, but I quickly learned that the battery life wasn't nearly the quoted time (it lasts about 2 days for me, 3 max with wireless off and the most power-saving settings). The e-ink/lcd screen mix was nice for navigation, although I understand that the newer touch models will be more battery-efficient. Despite this drawback, it was so much more convenient than paperbacks. As much as I love the feel of books, in a NYC apartment, there just isn't all that much room for them!That nook lived for about 9 months until a part of the screen died - just black pixels. I called customer service and after a long painful process, got it replaced. The unit I got was clearly a refurbished unit, which wouldn't have bothered me, had it been identical to the one I sent it. My original nook had a two-part screen, this new nook had a one-part screen and its' buttons squeaked when pressed. Little did I know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect! As it happened, this 'squeaking', which made the buttons difficult to press, also caused the page-turn buttons to crack just one month past warranty. Needless to say, I wasn't delighted. Apparently, the page-turn buttons cracking is a very common defect. So if you buy a nook, remember this: if the button squeaks and is hard to press, it will break. Return it while you can. Not all the nooks are like this (my old one wasn't), so I recommend checking it out.Overall - 3/5 - it's a solid reading device but doesn't really compare to the new-generation nook simple touch/kindle touch devices or even the Kindle 3 keyboard (which I now also own).",3
"I bought a Nook today. The one and only reason I chose Nook (instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1) is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund, not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work, like my Kindle did (and still does) and all of my Apple products do. But, like so many other reviewers here, my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First, it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on B&N; and strong WiFi in my home, plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then, when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked, it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the B&N; website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off, using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out (the fully charged) battery, etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So, am taking it back and won't buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle, and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindle's inability to download library books.  I'm giving the Nook two stars instead of one because, if it actually worked, it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.Update: 1/28/11Went to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go, so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook, so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast, wifi connected easily with my signal, downloaded a book quickly, and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update, and there's probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So, I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.Update: 2/3/11Returned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to, but there is one problem (design flaw?) that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color, lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either, seemed like too many steps and screen flashes, but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is, again, that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is, like an iPad, highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off, which it is most all of the time during reading, you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it, almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me, no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances, the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect (haha) that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle, but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem, it is that big of a deal.Yet another update! 5/31/11Caved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook, but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So, last week when B&N; had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website (99.00, free ship, 3g/wifi, non-color, refurb w/ full warranty) I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in Jan/Feb. I am using the Nook just for library books, and it does what it's supposed to do. Navigation works well, but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook, the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light. I will keep this Nook until Amazon does ePub, then stick with Kindle.",3
"There are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the Nook and Kindle, so I'm not going to go into a full-blown comparison and review. I'm going to focus on my experience owning both, most specifically battery life and availability of books.My husband uses the kindle and I use the Nook. The reason I went with the Nook is because initially I was very ""anti"" non-paper book. He wanted a kindle and I sneered at the idea. I was being a book snob and didn't like the idea of books in electronic format, so I snubbed my nose at it.However, after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books, and I had 8-10 big paper books, I began to reconsider my position.  Upon return from our vacation I elected to get a Nook. I did so because I liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard, which I thought made the kindle look klunky. I thought overall that the Nook was more aesthetically pleasing. So - I ordered the nook.There are two major things that the kindle has on the Nook, and that is far superior battery life, and significantly more books available for download - especially so if you read non-fiction.The battery life on my Nook is awful. So much so that I ordered a new battery thinking perhaps I had a dud. Nope - it's performance is just the same. If I am actively reading a book I have to recharge  every 3 days. If I don't read it for 10-14 days it will drain on it's own. Comparing this to my husband's kindle, he can go an entire 2 week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle! It takes a couple months to drain with no usage. The kindle's battery life is mega-much more than my Nook. I have serious battery life envy. For that alone I've begun to covet his kindle.The second bummer is that most of the available books for Nook are fiction. There are some of the more popular non-fiction type books available. Usually whatever is most trendy at the time, but for the most part any professional type texts, or anything not on a best seller list that is non-fiction can't be found for the Nook platform. However, when I go to Amazon, 8 of 10 times, I'll find it available for download on the kindle.BUT! One thing about this is that for me, I tend to mark up and highlight my non-fiction books a lot because I'm using them for reference sources. It is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real, paper books. So I've actually come to realize that I'd likely be purchasing my non-fiction as real paper books anyways, so that I can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags (yes - I'm a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books!) So, I'm now fine with the fact that I can't readily download non-fiction to my Nook and instead I continue to buy them as regular, paper books. As I said above, I'd likely buy my non-fiction as real books anyways since I use them as references.I now download all my fiction books to the Nook. So it's become my source for pleasure reading, which is great, since that is the kind of stuff I take with me when I travel or about town anyways, and can just stuff the Nook in my purse.However, I VERY MUCH ENVY THE BATTERY LIFE OF THE KINDLE! If I could stuff a kindle battery into my Nook I'd be a super happy girl.If I had it to do over I'd likely buy a kindle for myself despite it's less aesthetically pleasing appearance. The battery life and availability of books is far superior to the Nook.",4
"Had this for sevral months now and I love it. I love the touch screen which lets me see the covers of books in COLOR!VERY easy to set up account with B&N; using my nook. It serches for wi-fi and is very easy.Anytime I have had any problem, a simple re-boot fixes it.I love the ""free Friday"" that is offered. I have read SOOO many books since I bought it.I also think I would like the ""Lend Me"" option if any of my friends HAD a nook.",5
"Pros: eInk display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast. Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N.; Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).Cons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)I've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.The Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N; does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.Add the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N; store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience. I now prefer it to reading books in print, to be perfectly honest.",5
I have had my Nook for a week now and just love it.  I find the touchscreen easy to understand and use.  I have downloaded books from the local public library using OverDrive and Adobe Digital Edition and all have come through perfectly.  Downloading books from B & N have been quick and efficient.  I like being able to Find/Search forward and backward and to be able to look up words easily.  I have used bookmarks and highlights as well.  I also like the feature of being able to go to Last Read Page or to quickly pick a page using the Go To.  I have downloaded my own wallpaper and screen savers.  The two reasons I chose the Nook over the Kindle:  local support at Barnes and Noble and the ability to borrow ebooks from the public library.  I also easily added my own MicroSD card and added personal PDF documents to it. I love reading on it!!!,5
"I will continue to update this review as I discover new features of the Nook, so stay tuned folks!*****************************************************************************Updated 02/08/2010*****************************************************************************I've been using my Nook with the newest update (v 1.2) for a few days now.  This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!The LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!Several of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.*****************************************************************************Updated 01/31/2010*****************************************************************************This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's ""wade in the weeds"" and look at some of the features in detail:LCD TouchscreenSo far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.The keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.Wi-fiThe built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N; store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.Memory ExpansionThe Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N; desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.AppearanceThis is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking ""not too bad"" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.Book formats and availabilityThis is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N; and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.eInk displayIt seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.Replacable batteryThis is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.Battery lifeA lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.Ease of useThe Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.SummaryThere are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.*******************************Update*******************************So, I had been told on these comments that the B&N; in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.  I stopped in at the B&N; in Hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional.  My Nook immediately recognized the B&N; network and connected without me even having to tell it to!  As it turns out there is exclusive content at each B&N; store, at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for FREE!!!  So, seeing one that piqued my interest I naturally downloaded it.  Wow, super fast and convenient, and FREE!",5
"The Nook is the best e-reader yet. It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N; store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary:While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.  You can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook, iPhone, a PC and a Mac.",5
"This is a good item. Even though it's old, it's sticks to what an reader should be. It really is good for just reading books. It has great battery and the 3G works everywhere",5
"I already own a Wi-Fi + 3G Kindle and had compared reviews between the Nook and Kindle extensively, before buying the Kindle.  But because the Nook allows you to borrow books from the local library for free, and my wife was hogging the Kindle, I decided to try a Nook, at a reduced price.  While the Kindle is clearly a superior product, (lighter, faster, easier to use and much longer battery life), I found the Nook okay at the price I paid.It was a little difficult to learn how to navigate with the touch screen and the set-up seemed ponderous, but once I got the hang of it, I've borrowed a book a week from the library.  The reduced price for the product was because someone had returned it and it presumably had been repaired.  I haven't found anything wrong with it and it looked new, unscratched and unmarked, so as a back-up to a Kindle, I'd recommend it.  I'm getting about 3-5 days of battery life in ""airplane mode"" (wi-fi and 3G turned off), and that's enough to finish a book without recharging.  I'm not rating reliability, because I've only had it for about a month.",4
"If i had known that the 3g is not good for anything except purchasing books (yes I know it is my fault for not doing more research), I would not have paid more for the 3g version as I don't need the ability to get books anytime anywhere.  The web browser only works on wifi.  Anyway, I really like the Nook. I bought a refurb from one of those daily deal sites for a very good price. I have only had it for about a week so I can't speak for it's reliability but I have loaded lots of free ebooks (what I bought it for) from various sources, some audio books for my kids, and some music.  I like the web browser and the sudoku game.  The only thing I would change if I could is to have an option to combine the ""my b&n library"" with ""my documents"" because when you get books from anywhere else besides B&N, it goes to your documents.  I would like to be able to pull up my ""mysteries"" shelf and be able to see all of my mysteries not just the ""documents"" set or the ""B&N"" set.  I think it would make it more user friendly to have that be an option (only an option since some people probably like it the way it is).  It's a bit heavier than I thought it would be but not unmanageable.  I haven't used the library yet but have gotten epub books elsewhere (the epub ability is the reason I chose Nook over Kindle even though there are a lot more free Kindle books).  Overall, yes I would recommend a Nook but I would have gone for the cheaper wifi version had I known that the 3g was useless to me.",4
n my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable. i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader.other issue is font randomly changing from small to medium in pdf format.,1
"My wife has had a Nook for a few months and loves it.  I ordered one thinking it would be great.  It arrived and I loaded a part of my book collection and immediately ran into trouble.If I loaded a few books all went well but when I tried to load about one hundred it gave me a message that it was looking for new items.  I don't know where it went looking but it was a long long trip.  Ten hours later it was still out looking.I tried everything including customer service.  Emailed - never heard from them.  Phoned and the tech blamed me, the books etc but never the Nook.  Resulting conclusion from him was that I should buy books from Barnes and Noble so they would work.  I asked why they advertized that it would read .pdf and .epb.  He said, well, most of the time it reads them.Phoned tech again and this one said that it was defective and set up a replacement.  Replacement came and it was doing the same thing.  I left it for nearly twelve hours and nothing happening.I googled and found others are having the same problem, some believe it is related to the new update Barnes and Noble put out.  I am no longer concerned as it is on the way back.",1
"I won't rehash the Nook vs. Kindle issue, but we'll say I chose to buy the Nook because it just sounded better based on what people were saying. HOWEVER - I'd say i made a huge mistake. I loved the way the Nook worked, but reliability becamea huge issue. My first Nook died within 24 hours. I figured it was just a bad egg, took it back, and they completely replaced it with a brand new one. My second one died 6 months later. I took it to two different stores and they were unable to fix it. Since it is still under warranty, They advised I call or email.  Over the last 3 months, I've sent several emails and get auto-responses saying they have a higher volume of messages than usual, please call. I've also racked up tons of cell phone minutes trying to call and have yet to break through before my lunch break is over, or my toddler starts wanting my attention, etc... I guess I'll just chalk it up to a total waste of my money and start saving for a Kindle!!!",1
"I Wondered if this is designed solely for reading Text-only books/magazines. I have some books with i purchased are in PDF. Plus i have some word documents which i have converted to PDF. Both in my books and in my Word-Converted-PDF files have lot of pictures. Lot of the data are tabular representation are actually pictures. When i read them in nook, The letters in the pictures are virtually unreadable as they are too small. When i try to increase the font size, it does not work. IT WORKS ONLY FOR TEXTS! I Have never used kindle so don't know if the issue is there in kindle too. Also the PDF Pages are scattered all over the place. 1 Page in actual PDF file appears as 3 pages sometimes with a blank page in between. Not sure what is causing this.MY Nook does have a Web Browser but it only works with WI-FI, Not with the 3G. In 3G you can ONLY interact with BarnesandNobles.comThe touch screen response and user-friendliness are OK. Not great, After dealing with much more faster and better touch screens we use now-a-days.Go for it (And Kindle) if you are reading Text only book with very little or no graphics. AMAZON and B&N; Needs to improve their products and i am sure they will!",3
"I got the Nook the day before Nook Color was announced. I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.There were some rumors that the Nook Color would feature a screen with Mirasol technology, and I was disappointed to learn that it actually had an LCD screen coated with something to reduce glare. I state at an LCD screen all day at work, and don't want to do the same while reading. Plus, I'm not sure how well the LCD screen would fare in the sun and I'm interested to hear feedback from Nook Color owners.I think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines, or textbooks, or kids' books, none of which I'll be doing. Nook Color also stores more books (6000) and allows the reader to send updates to Facebook and Twitter directly from the eReader. Personally, I didn't find any of these extra features particularly appealing, so I'm happily sticking with the original Nook.My Observations/Pros of the Nook-It's bigger than I expected, in a good way. It's not heavy, but has a nice ""significant"" feel to it.-I think few people realize how clear and book-like the e-Ink screen actually is. I showed the Nook to some friends, and that was the first thing they noticed.-The bottom LCD touch-screen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers.-Getting ePub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy, although you have to connect the Nook to a computer in order to transfer the ePub files.-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.-The instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the Nook.Cons-BN.com has a Free NookBooks section, but for some reason, not all the free eBooks are listed. I saw some Kindle titles that were available for free, and when I searched on BN.com, turns out they were free there as well.-I didn't care much about the LendMe feature of the Nook, but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased eBooks can be lent out. Publishers control which titles can be used for lending, and each book can only be lent out once....ever.-The PDF manual for the Nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing.-There are definitely more Kindle books than NookBooks available, but I hope that will change in the near future.All in all, I am pretty happy with the Nook and I think the fact that it supports a wider range of eBook formats outweighs many of the cons. I like not being tied down to one proprietary format and being able to check out eBooks from the library is priceless to me.",4
"Very happy with the purchase of the nook.  Wonderful minimalist design lends well to an e-reader - It's easy to hold and is the perfect size for those used to the size of a paperback (slightly larger, yes, but certainly not as large as the Kindle or the Ipad).  I'm tired of these negative reviews about devices that are defective - Yes, we all get electronics that go bad, but really, can't you talk about the functionality of the device a bit?  Anyway, the device isn't perfect (interface not as smooth as the Ipad), but for the price and functionality it's great.  I can read e-books borrowed from my local library, have free 3G service when I'm out and about, and I like the fact that the reading screen is not touch based (avoids fingerprints).  All in all, worth the price.",5
"perfect, as described Thank you",5
"Great Product Great Sale, I just Love this product, and my children will too I want one for myself this is suppose to be their christmas gift but I want one now.",5
"The Nook HD is a great $100 book reader. It is sometimes on sale for even less at Barnes & Noble stores.It is NOT an Apple Ipad, but it will let you check email, surf the internet, listen to music on Pandora or watch movies on Netflix.Barnes & Noble stores have free classes to teach you how to use your Nook and most have an expert in the store every day to answer questions.An owner's manual is provided in the Nook's preloaded library. Work through the manual page by page to learn all of its features.Add a 32gb or 64gb memory card and carry your favorite movies on vacation.",4
It's a fine tablet.  The screen is excellent.  The speakers are very good.  The interface is a little clunky but easy to use.  It does just what I want it to do and it does it well.,5
I couldn't have asked for a better product! I upgraded from the Nook Color to the HD and I am super happy!!!,5
I had to put generic Android on it because Barnes and Noble had it so hamstrung. Should have gone with the new 7&#34; Nexus. No built in GPS turned out to be a major lack.,2
"I am already a kindle owner and I love my kindle. The kindle does have some limitations, most especially in the handling of pdfs. The kindle does not annotate and curate highlighted text of pdf's you upload. This is where I found the Nook HD more useful, apart from the fact that it gives you full access to the Play Store. In handling big pdf's, the Nook HD is slow and the highlighting of scanned pdf's is not very smooth. I really tried to love the Nook but did not and so I did not use it beyond the first month. I will not recommend the Nook. If your goal is the android store, just get a nexus tablet and download B&N app. It is cheap and works much better than the Nook.",2
"When attempting to live chat with their customer service, I was ignored 3 times where the other agent never responded and then the chat timed out, and had the session terminated 3 times for some unknown reason right after their standard ""it's not really broken"" response was written. All because I wanted to know why my the touch screen on my nook stopped responding to input.Then I called and was literally cussed (f word) at a minute in for asking about what was wrong with their live chat. Maybe I was just really unlucky and the person I talked to was angry or planning on quitting or something, but I still find it unacceptable.Seriously, go with a kindle or something else instead. Amazon's customer service has always been well above average for me.",1
"I had given my kids a Nook Color a couple years ago. Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out.  They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an ""app drawer"" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching. It really is a great design, and far superior to the tiresome carousel on the Kindle Fires.",5
I bought this for a friend who studies programming using e-books while he's at work (repairing cars) - and he loves it.,5
"Bought it for my wife to use primarily as a reader but also to occasionally access the net and read email when not at her computer.  She absolutely loves it.  It's the perfect product for her.  The reader portion is excellent.  The web graphics are vivid and colorful.  It has great functionality for such a small machine and last but not least, the price is right.",5
"Exactly the same as from Barnes and Noble but less expensive. It has been working great and doing more than I even needed. Wow! Arrived on time, I was a bit worried about the packaging as it came in a bubble envelope in its Nook box, but everything was fine.",5
She has been using a Nook e-reader for several years. I decided to get her the tablet because she wants to read email and browse as well as read her ebooks.  Her little smart phone was just too small to use.  Now she's using it regularly to browse and can easily read her gmail.,5
This is a very good tablet for reading..satisfied with my purchase..very handy and easy to tucked in your purse or in your hands..just convenient for my need..,5
"Brand loyalty aside, the NOOK HD AND the Kindle FIRE HD are both great products. I have a Barnes & Noble store about one mile away. I called with some typical learning curve operating questions and was treated with courtesy and competence. my After my poor effort to explain the issues on the phone, the local B & N NOOK expert offered to come IN PERSON to help me. Took about 15 minutes.Try that with Amazon! LOLNow with Google Play. An exceptional product with exceptional people backing it up.",5
Very good product for those with a Nook book collection. Works well with apps. All google play apps are available except for those requiring a camera.  I brought two units for my children and there are lots of apps and books for them. The Nook HD will read certain books allowed. My two units ended up being defective and kept crashing. Was able to return both with no problems.,4
"When I learned the modifications Barnes & Noble made to its Nooks and saw the price drop, I decided to get one formy very active 6 year-old grandson. He loves it. Despite him being a rough & tumble outdoor boy, it has held up wellfor a few months now. I attribute this partly to solid quality build and partly to the Nook HD 7&#34; being so thin & lightweight.I recommend this tablet, especially for children, a much better buy than those heavier, more expensive & slower tabletssold for children.",5
"I bought this refurb for under $100 and so glad I did! I tried the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (expensive and glitchy), the Lenvovo Idea Tab (poor performance) before I settled on the Nook. After using tablets at both high and low-end price points I figured I had nothing to lose--and was pleasantly surprised by the Nook's capabilities!On the Nook I can read BN or Kindle books, play Scrabble from the Android store, and watch Netflix. More advanced features such as GPS and camera are unnecessary for me, and I enjoy the simplicity of this device. It has a sturdy build and even though I did not want a white tablet (fear of dirt) it has not been an issue. I have had it for several months and don't feel anxious about using it without a cover.It's ease of use, clean interface, adequate battery life, and features make this a winner for me in the under $100 category. Add to that BN's 1-year warranty and I am more than satisfied with my purchase.My only qualm with the Nook HD is that it has a proprietary charging cable (not a micro usb like cell phones) so it is an extra cord to carry when traveling. In addition, it will not fit just any usb plug (something to do with wattage, I think). So if you plug the usb end into a travel charger or car charger it may not work. Same thing with using a usb port on a computer. IMO this is a major limitation for an otherwise great device, especially for someone that travels frequently.",4
I had a Nook Tablet which was fine. Saw these at Barnes and Noble and picked some up for the kids. The difference between the HD and the table is night and day. The screen is amazing. The addition of Google play makes this an incredible value in a tablet. It also turns it into a Kindle. The kids are busy on all our long car rides. The SD card make it completely expandable. We can watch Netflix with Wi=fi or load the SD card with movies for a road trip. It's under 100 bucks too. GREAT!,5
"I got one of these for Christmas, and I LOVE it! At first I wasn't all that fond of it because the only way to purchase apps and such was to use the nook store, but recently they had an update that added all sorts of Google apps, including Google Playstore. It has great graphics compared to previous nook tablets. It is great to read with, but the books are a little pricey.Now that it has Google Playstore and great graphics, I can't think of a reason for somebody NOT to get it!",5
"I recently bought the nook HD white for 129 greenbacks from BN. I had originally purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The Nook is lighter and the screen is brighter/sharper than the Kindle Fire. With the recent update to allow the full version of Google Play, a lot of the original limitations with the Nook have gone away. The chrome browser beats Silk all the way. You can actually download the Kindle App from the Google appstore and read all the books. However, you cannot install the amazon appstore and I had to buy some of the apps from Google play that I had originally purchased. There are no ads with the nook. Even with the Fathers day sale (which put the Kindle no-ad version at 195), this is cheaper by 65 bucks. An additional benefit is you can add an external SD card and there are options to boot a full blown standard Android Jellybean from the SD card with the nook from places like (AFN - android for nook for just 10 bucks).The two main downsides are that it lacks a front facing camera, but I really have no use for that and the parental controls are not that easy to set as in the Kindle (you can create a child profile and make sure that the password has to be entered, but I have not fully figured it out).I liked it so much that I bought a second nook in smoke color today.",5
"Pay close attention.  I would be very cautious about swallowing a few of the &#34;most helpful favorable reviews&#34;.  Pay attention to that quoted phrase.  I strongly suspect many are paid reviewers or actually employees or someone connected with the addons for the Nook.  Just a &#34;heads up&#34;.  Amazon loves to put the &#34;favorable&#34; insiders up front because the bottom line is sales and what leaves your wallet into theirs is the driver.My Nook is okay for the $79 at my local computer store that wanted to get rid of them.  Its not a bargain at the prices we see here.  If you're serious about a tablet then save up for a good one if you can.  If not, it should work for you.Most folks are putting out honest reviews, some whine artists, some scammers, some who just need to talk to someone.  We can't do much about that, but we can comb through and pick out what we might be able to trust.",3
Am tired of non-standard charging cables...  I like micro USB and the majority of hand held electronic devices use micro USB now.  Why is the NOOK HD using a non standard 30 Pin charging cable?  We returned the NOOK to Barnes and Noble!,1
"I received the basic Nook as a Christmas gift. Never really wanted a reader or tablet. I'm an old-fashioned book kinda gal. But, when my daughter and I decided to make a trip to Spain, I returned the Nook reader and decided to upgrade to the HD so that I could travel with a tablet that would enable me to check email, surf the web, and read books and magazines. I'm just learning to use it but so far I think I'm really going to enjoy having this tablet. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it didn't come with a manual (I did say I was an old-fashioned book kinda gal). Would highly recommend the Nook HD for your entry into the world of tablets and readers!",4
"I did such extensive research trying to decide between the kindle and the nook. I settled on the nook because I had read nothing but good reviews and the price was excellent.Positive:It has a beautiful screen with great vibrant color. The adjustable backlight is great for night time reading and reading in the sun.It's lightweight and comfortable to read with.Negetive: I find it has many glitches. From having trouble unlocking my screen, to having trouble getting the screen to even turn on so I can unlock it, to having my kindle application crash every time I get to the end of the book. I understand that it is probably an application issue with kindle, BUT having kindle compatibility was an absolute priority for me, as most of my library is on amazon. Furthermore, my battery doesn't last at all. I have to power down my device every time I put it down, otherwise by the time I pick it up again to read, it's dead. Won't even last a day. I've figured out that disconnecting it from wifi helps it last longer but not nearly enough. I was used to an iPad that lasted almost a week without charging. This battery time is unconvenient and unacceptable.Those are the main glitches that impact my experience with this device. I don't recommend getting this tablet. I would like to purchase the kindle fire and give this away as a gift.",3
"Just want you to know that I did not get this tablet from Amazon, got it from Walmart but I must say that the tablet is great.  I searched it on Amazon but because it was near X-Mas I went to Walmart and bought one so as to ensure I would have it by X-Mas.  The Nook Tablet looks and works just fine, was a gift for my granddaughter.",5
I cant say enough good things about this tablet i love it. First off the screen is beautiful.Its vivid and the colors are great.The best for the price no doubt. Its even nicer than the nexus 7 screen.Tablet performance is good for a dual core tabletand the gpu is a good one sgx540 same as some of the ipads so games run pretty well.weight ergonomics and screen size are just right.The quality of this tablet is excellent. It also has Bluetooth which Manny tablets don't have in this price range.Personally i love the Ui Barnes and noble put on this table its nice. And now with Google play you have a gazillion apps to choose from.Battery life is also pretty good and WiFi works well.The tablet has 2 speakers and there decent pretty loud which is nice.I got mine on sale for 100.00 is worth every penny. I guess the only minor thing i found was it gets a little warm at times but that's typical of Manny tablets and phones.,5
My Daughter bought these for her children through me. They love them.  I would recommend them to everyone that likes this kind of stuff.,5
"A year after Barnes and Noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the Nook HD+ 9"" is still one of the best values in the tablet market.  The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don't wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.There are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9"". First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display.  You will note that  by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9.  In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode.  The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat.  These can be used either by flashing the tablet's ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook's original operating system untouched.We have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20.  So for a reasonable price one can get a ""rooted"" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.This tablet was originally released in November of 2012.  It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8"" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013.  The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics.  It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.We had a Galaxy Tab 3 8"" and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8"".  They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear.  The Nook has neither of these features.  But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.Many of these were sold so there is a very good support network.  Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects.  The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here.  They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available.  I am giving it 5 stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made, but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale... it is the best tablet value that I am currently aware of.",5
"Look folks this is not a $400 IPAD or Samsung.  If you want a wizbang then you don't want the Nook HD.  For me it fit all my needs without needing a loan to buy one.  I ordered my direct from B & N for $179.00.  It came pre registered in my wifes account who has the nook color.  It is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but, at the same time can pick what you want that they have.  No need to repurchase what they already have.What Barnes and Nobel doesn't really want you to know is that you can put Amazon's Kindle app on the nook and read Kindle books (both free and purchased from Amazon).  I also noted that, with the Kindle app, you can adjust the fonts and resize PDF documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading PDF's.Lets not forget its a 9 in screen.  Battery holds well at 10 hours.I bought a 32GB SD card and so far have put 15 movies ( and stiil room for many more) on the card to watch in HD. I choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny SD micro card. Buy ""DVD Catalyst"" ( really cool program for $9.95)(can try it for free)on line to compress those movies from DVD and then it automatically puts it on the micro card.I seen some gripes about them adding Google store.  Not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T ADD ANY GOOGLE APPS. Its still a free country.So for reading ebooks, movies, games, apps and many others all for $179.00, for me it hit my tickle spot. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because it did not have a camera, crappy speaker on the back instead of single or dual on the front.  And the power cord is just too expensive for a crummy cable.",4
"I've bought a few Nooks over the years and have always loaded CyanogenMod (plain Android) off an SD card (and a few times on the actual device).The HD+ is no exception. As long as you understand that it doesn't have a camera, its powerful and inexpensive. It even comes with Google Play! East your hear out Kindle users!Up for your own project? Head over to the XDA developer forums and find out how to load a clean version of Android either right on the device or run it off a microSD card.Great screen, fast processor. This thing still has enough power to run the latest apps and Android OS!",5
"Well, I bought it because of the 1080p resolution.  The screen quality is beautiful.  I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price.  After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move.  The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat.  With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store.  With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free.  I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something.  With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter.  I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS.  I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s.  With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities.  You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card.  The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet.  One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS.  If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad.  By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook.  One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.",5
My husband had one and I got this one for Christmas. It keeps all my books and crafting patterns in one place.,5
"Review for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+A new winner in the ""best value in a mid-size Android tablet"" category.When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N; ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined ""reader"" and ""Android tablet"" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the ""Nook Today"" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just ""back"" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can ""override"" the Nook UI and install other ""launchers"" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9"" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy ""HOME"" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice ""soft touch"" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)The Nook HD+ is a ""sleeper"" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.  A 5 star item for features, design, performance, and value.",5
I bought this tablet for someone as a gift. I was so confused about which one I should get them. I definitely chose correctly for them.,5
"I cannot believe the seller who sold me this not good, great Nook HD+, that is keeping me very happy. I have been truly blessed, this Nook tablet is the best. I am watching movies on it via Hulu and Netflix and other apps for movies etc. The video and audio are great for me either outside on my porch or indoors.I do not plan to do much more other than playing a game here and there, this tablet is sufficient to my needs. There is no camera, if you need one get another type of tablet. I recommend for those who do not need a super tablet, however, this tablet can do a lot. I just have not tried it all yet. I will  again say this, the video playback to me is awesome,it is truly HD. I am very satisfied with my refurbished Nook HD+, II am getting a lot for very little. I recommend buying thNook for a few dollars worth a  lot of fun.",5
"I bought this Nook HD+ in the summer for $179 from BestBuy. It seemed like the best value at the time for a 32GB tablet.I thought that it would be good for our trip to Spain.  We ended up using it to watch a few movies on the plane and that was it.Fast forward a few months of neglecting using the Nook and the device will not even turn on.  I keep thinking that I am doing something wrong, but the next step is most likely going to be a trip to BestBuy after I confirm that I ordered the extended warranty (it's been a busy time for us!).So needless to say I am not impressed....UPDATE:Well, the Nook decided to Power on again when I followed the instructions to turn on a ""dead Nook"".  I don't have the instructions right here, but if you find them (has to do with pressing and holding two of the buttons at the same time), make sure to look at your screen very carefully because one of the options is to restore your Nook to factory settings - and you won't want to do that if you have anything stored on it.I will just have to see how it goes.Wish Amazon Instant Video would play on it, but RedBox now offers an $8 monthly subscription rate for 4 dvds at the kiosk and unlimited streaming.That along with NetFlix give me two options for streaming video.",3
"Having all the iPad models, 9 different Android models, I can say this tablet overall is a bit disappointing. I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7"" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N; version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N; puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N; releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.PROSGood resolutionTouch is goodGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7"" tabletHas Play installedExternal memory card optionCONSB&N; OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly BeanSpeakers are just OKVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devicesCharger plug is very tight on both of my models. Perhaps it will loosen up over time. Never had a tablet exhibit this in the past.Lack of support from the aftermarket in terns of ROM availability.No cameraOld slow Wi-Fi hardware, and you will notice this. Download speeds compared to my other tablets is very slow.",2
"This is good product compared to its price. I'm using it for watching video, writing documents, and web searching. It's perfect for my needs, and I upload CM 1.0, so now I'm using it with Android... It's so good. :-)",5
"Brand new condition. Fast shipping. this tablet is the best deal on a 9&#34; size that you can get. Way better than what the same size cost in my last husband.Easy to use, lots of storage for apps even the large ones. PLUS will hold additional scancard. Beats the Kindle (sorry Amazon) by a mile in functionality, weight and price.",5
Got this for my nook (since B&N didn't have it!) Good price and exactly what I needed. It also seems to be a better made product than the one that came with my color nook.,5
"Bought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my Nook Tablet. Wished I could just get the cable as the AC plug works fine. After 2 weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again. This is the 3rd Barnes and Noble cable I have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again. Any plain micro usb cable will charge the Nook Tablet,so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead.",2
"I had the original adapter that came with my Nook Color for 2 years without any problems. After 2 years it finally broke, and I didn't even know people were having troubles with their chargers until I had to buy a new one. I have had this one for at least a couple weeks now and again I don't seem to be having any problems with it.The original charger that did finally break was because of the area where it plugs into the system though, which is where everyone is having problems. So I will not deny that this seems to be an issue. For that it loses a star, but because I personally haven't had any major problems with them I will still give it 4 stars.",4
"The original chargers I had for the Nooks were dying, as in literally falling apart after a couple years. Hopefully these replacement chargers will last just as long, if not longer.",5
This is the third adapter that I have tried other than buying direct from B&N.  This adapter is quality made and works excellent with the device.  It is better made than the original.  Great value.,5
WORKS AS DESCRIBED .. OWNED 3 YEARS NOW AND WORKS WELL.. NO COMPLAINTS HERE.  GREAT PRODUCT AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE,5
Since it's a cable for digital data... shielding isn't a big issue with HDMI. Use it for my satellite boxes for 1080i HD plus audio. No problems.,5
only had it for a few weeks but have not noticed one problem for this price compared to other hdmi cables i feel like I won big on this item.,5
"It's not top of the line by any means, but certainly a good value for the price.",5
I bought this cable to hook up an Apple Tv.  Save your money on the expensive cable and buy this one..Works Great!,5
"This item does exactly what it says it will do - and at a good price.  If I had a complaint, it was that I did not purchase a longer one for what I need it for.  Of course, this is more of my fault versus the product.But, if the length works for you, and you need a HDMI cable, this will fill the job and do it very well.",5
"Wire is heavy grade, but as with all cables you can't really tell how strong the connectors are till they break.",5
Item was As described in post. Simple and just what I needed. Great price too. Actually bought two. Good value,5
"With Amazon Prime, these things are only $4! They arrived so quickly, just in time for me to hookup my computer and other entertainment systems into my new TV. They're fantastic!",5
"This cable works as advertised.  No need to spend more for an HDMI cable.  There is no difference in picture quality between this cable and brands costing much, much more.",5
they are inexpensive and they get the job done.  i'm glad i got them. i use them with my wdtv at work.love 'em and if i lose them i'll just buy another set or 2.,5
"GOLD is good. Makes the best quality connections for data trans. Length is more than adequate (6ft), as length can attenuate (diminish) the quality of signals. Also, sheathing to reduce/illuminate cross-talk or interference both in and out of the cable. Used to connect BluRay player (Wi-Fi) to 45 inch Plasma TV w/o a hitch. Amazon Cables are just as good. I think they all come from China. The thickness of the wire and the GOLD plate are both factors in quality data links. Like the size of a hose for water, and how much pressure it will endure.With FREE shipping you can't go wrong, and they are guaranteed. It took about three weeks for delivery.",5
"I don't have too much exciting to say about the cable.  I'm not a videophile by any means, but the cable works, I don't see any problems with it, and it is a bunch cheaper than I could get from Best Buy...",5
A cable is a cable. It's going to work 99.99% of the time no matter where you buy it. But Amazon always has the best prices!,5
this cable works FANTASTIC and i didnt have to pay $60 for it. i highly recommend!! so glad i gave a cheap price hdmi a shot.,5
The price was right and I cannot discern a difference between this cable and a higher priced cable I have in my possession. Maybe I'll see a difference when I upgrade to 4K products.,5
"Bought this to replace a $13, 3 foot cable bought from Target which would cause picture glitches and dropouts regularly - this one works flawlessly, is twice as long and a fraction of the price!",5
"Purchased this a few years ago and forgot to write a review. Needless to say I'm still using it and have no problems. I purchased this back when the cheapest HDMI cord was $30.00. Great buy, I recommend it.",5
"Much cheaper than buying in a local store, about one fourth the price. After actually using it, I realize that having a longer one would make some tasks I need it for much easier.",4
"brought back my IPOD video 30G back life, easy to replace.  Only hard part is to get the case opened.",5
"Awesome replacement for an ipod video 5th gen 30gb hard drive, saved me the cost of buying a brand new iPod.",5
"THIS ARTICLE WITH ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE THE PACKAGING AND JURISDICTION ENTRAG CORRECT, IN ADDITION TO RUN FERFECION",5
"A very easy replacement for a 5th gen ipod 30G HD.  I purchased the ipod on ebay knowing it was damaged.  It had the ""sad ipod face"" screen of death.  I could hear the HD trying to spin up, but not reading properly.  If you have that indication, all you need is this HD!The repair was easy.  Carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector.  The ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open.  Next, remove the bad HD by unplugging the ribbon cable ON THE HD SIDE.  Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in ""backwards"".  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.  There are resources on the net for this...I just started up iTunes and plugged in the ipod.  After a few min. iTunes reconized that the ipod needed to be restored.Good luck!",5
"My iPod video had hard drive failure.  I used iFixit instructions and this drive to make it work.Make sure you plug the cable in the right way.  Drive is shielded on both sides unlike the original so you have to look carefully.  If you get it wrong, iPod will tell you there is battery failure, but there isn't, it's just the drive in backwards.  I flipped it around and it worked, no harm done.",5
"Not much to say.  Dropped right into my Zune in place of the original drive.The cable release tab is extremely fragile, but the drive works just fine even though I broke the tab.. oops!",5
"My daughter's 30GB Ipod Classic needed a new Hard Drive and this worked great...about 5 minutes to install, plug in to Itunes and it set up by itself.",5
"Works great, but wasn't what i expected .  Thanks  Sent it back. Sorry. Maybe it will be good for a conferance room, but not for singing too record.",2
"Money well-spent.  I love this little speaker/microphone.  The sounds is very clear.  Volume buttons work great, and the microphone is great!!!  I love this item!!!",5
I use it on Microsoft Lynch for telecoms.  The speaker is a little &#34;tinny&#34; but the mic works well without echoing.,4
"I love this produtct.1. Echo canceling is working perfectry.2. It is avairable for room meeting.3. 3.5mm headphone jack.I bought it totaly more than 10, and I will buy more for my friends...",5
"I got this for my computer to use with my magic jack and I got no sound or nothing.  It may not be compatible with magic jack but more like Skype.  Since I don't have Skype, there is no way of knowing if it would work with Skype or compatible with it.",2
"We were very happy with this purchase at first, but some of the buttons have stopped working after using it a few times a week for a couple months.  The volume buttons no longer work and the volume can't be adjusted on the laptop, so we have to suffer through a blasting speaker in order to gain the benefits of the microphone, which also seems as if it may be starting to have intermittent problems.",3
"This film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent, delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of Samuel Clemens's classic.As one example, the book has great  fun with the scenes involving Aunt Polly, a simple minded soul who thinks  herself quite clever, and the genuinely shrewd Tom, who plays on catering  to Polly's illusions about her own wit. This is a far cry from beautiful,  intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty,  clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking  off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot;  his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility  is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school,  classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom  Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it  into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political  correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard. His rendition of &quot;If I Were God&quot;  (aside from its text having nothing to do with the story - Tom's only  church interests are in time to play with his pinch bug) is pure purgatory  for the listener.",2
"I hadn't heard of this 1973 movie version of the classic Mark Twain story until recently, but I absolutely had to see it.  After all, it had music by the Sherman Brothers (best known for their work in Mary Poppins).  And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel.  Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) is a young boy growing up in 1840's Hannibal, Missouri.  An orphan, he's being raised by his Aunt Polly (Celeste Holm).  And he is quite the handful.  He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East).  He constantly lies to get out of trouble, too.Through this movie, we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery.  He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him.  And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher (a young Jodie Foster).  But will Injun Joe (Kunu Hank) get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book, hitting all the highlights of the classic.  Frankly, that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going.  Once I got into the story, I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale.  The scenery and costumes recreate the times well.  And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately, I found the songs disappointing.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good either.  They aren't especially memorable or singable, and they don't really advance the story.  I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical, I must admit to enjoying it.  It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed.  And the songs are easy to overlook since they aren't a major part of the movie.  So if you are looking for a fun version of the classic tale, you can do much worse than this one.",4
"The advertisment for this DVD on Amazon was incorrect.  The ad stated that the DVD was in Wide Screen Anamorphic format.  The DVD was not in this format, it was standard Pan and Scan, and it was a poor quality transfer from the film.  I thought about returning it, but decided to give it as a gift.  Motion Pictures that are filmed in anamorphic, or 2.35 to 1 format should only be transfered to a DVD in this format.  The people that make the decision to use pan and scan to fill a standard television are ill advised, and poorly educated to artistic principles.",1
I would love to buy this movie as I have been to Hannibal Missouri and been to all the Mark Twain atractions.To buy this movie would be a real treat but if it's Pan&Scan forget it! I dont buy full screen movies! Unless it's made for TV.I think MGM should of included a widescreen version of the movie.What a joke!,1
"This movie was playing at Radio City Music Hall back in the days of the movie/stage show formt.  It was also presented in 70mm on that huge Radio City screen. I remember how impressed i was with that opening scene with the steam boat going down the river and you see Tom running thru the field and the music builds more and more.  Wow,,,,what a great movie!I've seen many versions of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; but this one seems to be the best ever brought to the screen.  Maybe because it's a musical. Whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by it's gradure and scope. A must for ever American kid and adult too. This is as red, white and blue as it gets and now must be the most politically incorrect movie ever made. (hehe)  Buy it before some group puts a ban on it. Which should want you to buy this for the kids even more. They don't make them like this anymore.",5
"This is a well-made and well-acted musical version of the Tom Sawyer story. It does not follow the book exactly, but the substance is there. Charming performances by then child actors Johnny Whitaker (Tom) and Jodie Foster (Becky Thatcher) and Academy-Award-winner Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I rented it for my granddaughter's school project and wound up watching it 3 times. It took me back to my childhood of playing with the children next door in a more neighborly world.Highly recommended.",5
"This fits my 7"" kindle fire hd perfectly! I love it. It even has a slot for a stylus. The kindle is velcroed in so it's nice and secure. Very glad I bought this!",5
"Good case, while not new to Kindle books I am new to Kindles, the Fire HD is my first one. I wanted some protection for it as well as something to hold it for me, I often read in bed and with this it stands up some. I wish it were more adjustable. The reality is the way I use it you have two choices, flat, or slightly inclined. The way the pictures show in the upper right it looks like it will stand almost upright, that's not practical for my purposes. I am not sure a case is made that would fit my desires, this is very nice although I felt overpriced.",4
Not the best leather but worked fine and keeps my Kindle safe and protected.  It should have come with a stylus.,4
"Case fits well on my kindle, serves the purpose and for the price, you can't beat it.Definitely a keeper.",4
"I got this got a new kindle fire hd owner who LOVES yellow. The case is nice for price, it does what it has to do but the smell at first is very unpleasant. I'm glad it arrived fast and I had time to leave it out of plastic for a few days  to air out till smell went away.",4
i love this case fits my kindle perfectly the only thing i dont like is that the power button is not visable in the case other than a great case,5
"It's her favorite color and it protects her kindle. She has no complaints. Covers the power button, but not a big deal.",5
the only downside to this was the cover covers up the on off button and the camera and I have to take it out of the cover to use the camera if I had known this I would have chosen a different one,4
"I bought this at the same time I bought the Kindel Fire HD 7. It is exactly as pictured, the fit was great, and the price was right. The reason for the 4 stars is the cut outs for the volume and power buttons are on the edges of case but the actual buttons are located on the back of the Kindel. You can't access either button while the case is on. Apparently when Kindel upgrades a tablet they don't change the name or add a number to it like Apple does with the iPad. I went back and searched for clues in the description that this was for a different version Kindel and did not find anything. If you want a decent case and you don't want to pay a lot for it, this is the one but just make sure it's designed for the HD 7 Kindel version you are buying.",4
"Great case, not sure how the hand stripe works and wish it had vertical stand but for the price it's the best case I ever had. Very soft and smooth on the inside. Color is the best.",4
"Well it is nice, i just bought the wrong one, any ways it fits my tablet. and I'm still using it.",3
I just received this today!!  I love it.  I have one similar for my Kindle Fire HD and I love the sleep and awake feature!!!,5
"Great case, especially for the price point.  My daughters favorite color so she loves it too.  Bought the matching stylus.",5
"worked great for what  I needed it for, and was small too",5
"I bought 4 of these for my test equipment - they got the job done. Though the screw on one of these did snap under medium torque... the other 3 adaptors were fine under the same torque. However, on a different one of these adaptors, I had to &#8220;open up&#8221; one of the pin holes slightly before it would accept my male cable. I would probably buy again.",4
Very compact and no problems with baud rates up to 115k.  Couldn't be happier with this adapter.  I highly recommend keeping this and the various related adapters to anyone who needs to interface with network equipment.,5
"This works as a null modem cable, just as advertised.This low profile connector is working perfect in combination with my USB RS-232 cable.",5
"Nice construction and nice labeling so you don't use it for the wrong thing.  It does the job and for only three bucks, you can't go wrong.",5
"It is not very often that I can get something cheap, fast, and that performs as it should.  This is one such item.  The hardware seems to be durable, it is very compact, and it performs the simple null modem task.",5
Bought this to transfer video from some old equipment. (Sony CCD-TRV308 Hi8 videocam and Panasonic Omnivision VHS cassette player.) It's not fancy but does the job. I prefer to use PotPlayer to capture/convert the video over the included software which works ok. I'm satisfied with this purchase.,3
"I have been using this alot, converting old video tapes, VHS, and tv into online videos. Anything you can play on your vcr, from tapes or tv, it can record.",5
The EZGrabber2 works well but it's software is a little lack luster. I have software installed on my computer that works properly with my night vision so the EZgrabber works well to do what I needed.,4
I bought it to create dvds from home vhs video. Had to upgrade my pc to a faster cpu to avoid jittery recording. After that it work as described. Delivery was fast.,4
"I got this because it was pretty decently priced, honestly though seeing how some of the other video capture devices out there were upwards of $60 I wasn't expecting much.  When I got, I was rather surprised how well it worked.  While it's plug 'n play, I decided to forgo the install CD and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.  While the video is decent quality, it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a DVD, the quality of the original played on a VCR is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a DVD.  That being said, it's not all that bad, really.  But since I only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old VHS-C camcorder it wasn't really worth it.I found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually (add a little more saturation, and sharpness), and use the ""DVD"" format for capture, that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc (I use windows DVD maker, because I'm cheap :B)The nice thing is it also includes an S-video option, unfortunately my VCR only allows S-video with 480p signals (ie DVD movies and restricts VCR video to 480i.  The DVD capture format seems to add some deinterlacing to the captured video from what I can tell (though it might just be my video card doing it)  Still, it's a pretty good buy for someone who wants to archive or even send family members burned DVDs of videos.",4
"A little background...I am a 38 year old man who has played around with electronics and computers my entire life. Windows 7-64bit machine with 8GB RAM blah,blah,blah.I have struggled well over a month with this piece of trash. After this experience I'm DONE with Micro$oft's depending on consumers to fix there crap OS and heading to Costco to let other computers do what this device clearly will not.",1
"I've used this cover with both a Kindle (Generation 2) and a Nook. Surprisingly, this case is better designed for a Nook for two reasons:>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.>>5 way directional key. The notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right. Because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook, it slides easily but I've never had it come out. I have however had it slide far right inside the cover, and then when I shut the cover it's at such a position that it hits the 5 way directional key and starts to advance chapters! I thought it was just a fluke at first, but then it kept happening. If I do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the Kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now. The Nook lacks this 5 way directional key entirely, so again - no issues there. (This issue might also be contributed to the ""breaking in"" of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles. I don't believe I've been rough with the case though, so I can only assume its common wear).I also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth I don't think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed.",2
"At the time I bought this cover the Kindle had just come out.(1st generation) It served its purpose , but since then there have been so many new cover in types and styles.",5
"Aw, come on, Moleskine -- you make a terrific Kindle cover to hold a notepad (Moleskine notepad, even) --- and then NO PEN LOOP? What kind of silliness is THIS???Love it in every way except that darned lack of a pen loop - clipping a pen to it is not the same and I don't want to dent up the cover...Wish it came in more colors, like Moleskine RED and the other Volant shades -- and that one could get the reporter notebooks in colors, too... but this doesn't mean I'm not happy with this!",4
"Overall: Good Kindle case, especially for Moleskine users. I use it and am happy with it.Pros:- Looks and feels like a Moleskine- Looks enough like a book or journal to disguise the Kindle- Looks nice on the inside and outside- Having a pad next to a Kindle is very good- Includes two reporter-style while slimmed-down MoleskinesCons:- No place to store a writing utensil- Won't fit standard Moleskine reporter books, even the soft cover ones (too rigid backing, too thick)- A lined journal would have been better- Feels like it needs another slit at the base to keep the journal from getting loose- Hard to get the elastic straps for the Kindle to look right",4
"As a longtime Moleskine user, I was very excited when I learned they made a Kindle case.  I have not been disapointed.  It's a sturdy case that looks great and performs well.  It's the first Kindle case I've owned that seems to be a ""permanent living space"" for my Kindle, if you know what I mean.A few reviewers seem to not like it because the notepad is on the left, while the Kindle is on the right.  I can understand their reasoning, but I actually prefer it the way it is - and I'm right-handed.  If the Kindle were on the left, with the notepad on the right, it would be more awkward to hold.  For the few notes I take on paper, it's really no big deal to reach over the screen to do so.That said, Moleskine ought to offer both a ""left"" and ""right"" handed version if the case.  I would think it'd be easy to simply flip the design.  Then people could choose which version they wanted.",4
"I purchased this because I was basically afraid to take my kindle anywhere without the case, and I love Moleskine notebooks.  The surface of the cover is soft... not like a normal Moleskine notebook.  The top left elastic strap does (minorly) interfere with the operation of the on switch.  It doesn't really bother me all that much though.  I have had mine for a week or two now, and it still has a chemical smell to it.  Be prepared to let it air out for a while.",3
"I've been waiting a while for this cover, and it's everything I thought it would be: Moleskine quality, substantial feel, nice holder for the iPad, and a replaceable pad.  The only thing missing is a pen loop.Other vitals you may want to know:-- It's 1.375 inches in thickness with iPad loaded (that's almost an inch and a half)-- The cover doesn't appear to be leather, even though it appears to be leather.  Just like the notebooks.-- Interior is microsuede-- IPad is very secure in there.-- Spine is rounded, not square-- You can fold back the entire thing so it's flat.-- Not able to prop this thing up to view from afar (too slippery), and no prop is included.-- All buttons, ports, and speakers are accessible.-- Looks good, feels good.All that said, Moleskine made a mistake with their design.  While they include directions on how to flip the unit around to use it for leftys, when you do so, the ""cover"" becomes the back, and vice versa... and on your new cover, you now have an embossed Moleskine Logo--UPSIDE DOWN!It's bad enough they didn't bother with a lefty unit, but I can handle flipping it around (and having my iPad home button on top).  And I can handle that once flipped the strap works the opposite of all other Moleskine products (since back is now front).  But to have Moleskine expect me to start at their upside down logo all day is more than I'm willing to settle for on such a pricey item.  I'm ANGRY that I waited for so long for a product with such a silly flaw.I hope they fix this, but considering how long it took them to produce the case, and how late it is coming to market even after it was announced, I don't think that they will.  Too bad.  Could have been a GREAT product.",1
"I'm starting my review over and changing this from 4 stars (I like it) to 2 stars (I don't like it).. At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1"" mark in terms of thickness.What did I like:-Construction quality, very nicely made.-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.All in all, it's  nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..--UPDATE 12/9/2010--I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to theMarware Eco-Vue for iPad. This out of all the cases I have use is the best for my personal situation. I wanted to like the Moleskine case but it just didn't work for me and I still can't find replacement notepads. Sorry Moleskine, perhaps revision 2 will be the one for me, but so far your case didn't meet my expectations.",2
"I have read many reviews on folio cases for iPad. You will find ""the best ever"" in most of reviews that have got over four stars. So, I won't say the cliche, but want to say that I am very satisfied. Although I love my iPad, I'd felt sad as a fountain pen collector that my fountain pens are no longer useful. Then, I bumped into this case. What a wonderful idea to put Moleskine with iPad!Someone said in the previous review that it is a inch thick, and it is true. I feel like I am holding a book. However, it makes me feel that my iPad is well protected. The quality of paper is good as always, and it is very easy to flip over. Also, it also has the rubber band! Since I don't have keen eyes to see whether it is real leather or not, but the skin feels smooth and soft.",5
"This product appeared to be high quality and well made.  It also has the feature that turns on the iPad when the cover is opened.The Moleskin does have a very nice, luxurious feel.For me, it was just too heavy.  Not in pounds, but when you hold an iPad up for a few hours, a few ounces can make a big difference.There is another iPad cover sold on Amazon that is a big seller, at around $20+, made of a synthetic material.  It is much lighter, and also turns on when opened.I hate to pass on higher quality and probably longer lasting, but this Moleskin cover was just too tiring for me.",4
"I have owned this for a month, hoping to use it in meeting situations where iPad typing and other forms of note taking doesn't quite get it. I was stunned to learn the tablets are not available with lines. Quite an oversight as they are overpriced to begin with. The cover holds the iPad in a fairly but not definitely snug manner.It is designed primarily for left handers with the plug and button holes oriented for the iPad to be placed upside down if the writing tablet is on the right side. No big deal for a right handed person.A note to Moleskin asking about future lined tablets was responded to with a trite ""go kiss-off"". A better product is bound to be offered soon from a more customer friendly, less smug company.",3
"I have (had) one of these, different vendor, came w/ a 1 yr warranty...died at 1 yr 2 months. I was unable to find anyone who repairs monitors like this, too.  Great while it lasted, but reliability is unclear (search on yamaksasi monitor failure and you'll see a lot of them die at just over ~1 yr.  I suspect a blown cap in the inverter from the symptoms). Also runs unusually hot at full brightness (both the screen and the power brick get quite hot).  To be fair, it's a heck of a steal otherwise, and the image quality and speed are terrific (you must have a DIV-D input, not just DVI-I or any other format like dp or hdmi or VGA; DVI-D has a full rectangle of pins on the plug, not two groups of pins. Search on DVI connector and you'll see lots of illustrations of the types if you're unsure).  Great for spreadsheets, gaming, etc. But...it died prematurely.",3
"I am a gamer and a coder. This monitor is great for both. Although i would like it a bit more with HDMI, it performs beautifully from my GTX 770 4GB DVI-D.",5
The monitor has only brightness and power controls.  There are five other unmarked buttons that do nothing observable.  There is only one DVI plug.  The included cable worked fine for me.I am running the monitor on RHEL 6.4.  The monitor periodically (once a week) would forget how to transmit its EDID on reset from standby.  I ended up downloading the EDID from the monitor and setting up my xorg.conf to load from file rather than from the monitor.  No more issues.I'm using the monitor in a dual-head sitting beside and HP 30&#34; supplied by work.  The height on the HP is adjustable to exactly match the Yamakasi.,4
"Since the resolution is great at 2560*1600 you can view magazine like HBR or Scientific America in dual page with crystal clear, flicker free. you need a proper placement on table since it cannot raise monitor up like my previous Dell 24 inch. The brightness and IPS performance so stunning. For Thailand friend, they send direct to your home and pay custom for 1700 B. Then this monitor is much cheaper than any 27 inch with same resolution selling in Thailand.Dr.PoonchaiBangkok, Thailand",5
"MUCH BETTER THAN THE 1440p QNIX AND DESTROYS ALL 1080p.This puts all the 120/144 hz stuff to bed. Unless you play *seriously* competitively (and you probably do not), then 1600p IPS absolutely destroys 1080 monitors with much higher refresh rates. Those are ok monitors and just fine, but if you have the horsepower( r9 290 or 290x, 780 or 780ti can DEFINITELY max this baby, other slightly lower cards still work very well, as well as crossfire and SLI), get this.No dead pixels, GORGEOUS SCREEN, and a really good stand. Straight monitor with no BS features. It turns on. It's a boss. It turns off.",5
"[[EDIT]]Now that I have upgraded my graphics card to a 2GB DDR5 card with a DVI-D port on it, the monitor gives me the full 1080p for movies and general resolution of 2560X1600. This was the problem. If you have a standard ""on board/integrated"" graphics card, then this monitor might not work for you.... you may not have a DVI-D port and it may not be able to support this hulk. On a different retail site, this company's recommendation was to have a minimum 1GB on your graphics card, and upgraded to a 2GB that is working quite well.I'm not a movie junkie but the colors look good to me. I have no complaints about the display.The monitor does run HOT though, which I think is typical for this style.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW, unedited:It came with no English manual, and no DVDs for drivers.Windows is running mine with the generic driver. The best resolution I can get is 1280X800, which looks horrific.I'm aware that the problem *might* be my graphics card, but this card is definitely capable of handling at least 1080p, and I cannot get even that. I actually can set it to 1080p, but I immediately get a black screen with colorful bar code gibberish.Can't get a setting for anything higher than 1080p, and definitely cannot actually use 1080p.I'm open to suggestions on how to fix this, especially if the seller is reading this. I'll bump this to 5 stars if they can help me resolve this (I will send an inquiry if I cannot get it fixed soon).",4
"Here's what you want to know.The stand is FINE.  There are only 5 working buttons on this.  This is the power button, a brightness button(s), and volume buttons.  There is no other screens, setups, no calibrations, etc.  All of that has to be done on your PC connected to this.  It is literally a straight monitor.  As advertised, not 1 dead pixel.Resolutions excellent.There is a powerbrick with this item (just an FYI).  Haven't had any issues with it.To mount the monitor on the monitor mount, put the backend on first, then put the big base on the 4 feet, screw them in (recommend using a drill on a very low setting to affix it.  The DVI connector is a good length.I'd recommend it. Went from a dual monitors at 1920x1080 (24 inch) to this beast.  Night and day.  I can have two documents up side by side with room to spare (my girl reviews allot of documents, and she was liking this hunking thing too).  It is a ""Large"" monitor (comparable to a 30 inch TV).Yes the instructions are in Korean, who cares.  The box has the whole sparta theme on it, don't care either.  It is a good monitor, good response time, awesome resolution.I would do this monitor at 2560x1600 vs a 4k monitor for 4 reasons.1) 4k monitors are $1,000+.  Yes there are cheaper ones but there cheaper because...2) Most 4k monitors run at 30hz.  Basically it means that the monitor can only display 30hz.  THIS monitor displays at 60 hz (which is fantastic).  To clarify, essentially hz is pretty much how much fps a monitor can display per second.  Now you can have a 4k monitor but if your graphics card is kicking at 1000 fps, your monitor will only support 30 fps of it (its a dumbed down version of it but hz matter, and you want at least 60, if not more3) 4k monitors may require more than 1 connection (aka 2 dvi port connections) to run well.4) 4k is still reaaaaly new.  There working the bugs out regarding creating a gaming 4k monitor that isn't over $1000.This is a 30 inch monitor, well under the 700 to 800 pricerange of other monitors that do the same thing as this one.To the gamers out there, loaded up counter strike, awesomenauts, eve online, all ran at this resolution, full screen, no bars.",5
"I ordered this thing and received it,I tried for hours to get it to connect to my home wifi network but to no avail.A couple of months later I bought a smartphone and connected to my wifi network in seconds,dont buy this piece of junk.",1
"Very fast, dependable OS (way better than the wm5), good buttons, nice scroll device, good battery life, bt and wifi works very well, the only glitch is that it would be nice to have a better screen, other than that is nearly perfect.",4

"The Dell Axim X30 624 Mhz was released in 2004. It still has a lot going for it; it's sleek, compact, and attractive, it's got Bluetooth and WiFi, and a 624 Mhz processor (the fastest processor available then). But I can't imagine why anyone would want to buy this outdated model, especially since the price listed here for a brand new unit is higher than what it retailed for in 2004. It uses Windows Mobile 2003 (WM v4), which isn't supported by MS anymore. The current version of Windows Mobile is 6.1.Additionally, Dell has discontinued the Axim X30 since 2007. You will have trouble getting support from Dell if you run into any problems.But complaints about it being outdated aside, the Dell Axim X30 has a few significant problems with it:1) A problem commonly reported is the backup battery going bad or burning out. There is no way to replace it unless you want to venture into cracking the case open and soldering the right kind of battery on.2) A lot of users, like myself, have the problem with the built-in storage spontaneously disappearing. The PPC doesn't ""see"" the drive anymore; it's like it doesn't even exist.3) Activesync frequently fails to sync some task and calendar items.4) Pathetic battery life. I can squeeze about 2.5 hours from the battery it comes with - and that's with Bluetooth ans WiFi turned off and the screem dimmed down.5) On my X30, the power/data connector completely broke loose.I would advise you to pass this up.",3
"This PDA came out in mid-2004, and it was a great PDA for this period.  Mine is still functional in 2012.I have had numerous PDA's; from the Palm M Series to HP's Jornada and IPAQ to a Toshiba and an ASUS MyPal A716. This Dell Axim A30 unit is by far - hands down - the most impressive unit that I have used.The unit is quite light and the display is very vibrant compared to the ASUS A716 (also still functional after all these years). It does not hang wile multitasking or viewing pictures - soft resets are few and far between.Even refurbished, these are very reliable - an all-in-one gadget for all your needs (I prefer having my contacts on a device that is not my phone). Shame that it does not come with a bottle and can opener or you would have a complete survival tool for urban living!",4
"Never had one of these before, and I love mine. Limit, as far as performance--can't take an SD card bigger than 2G (no SDHC cards), and only runs Windows Mobile 2003 SE. Still works great for what it does. Can connect via 802.11b to just about any hotspot available, and plenty of apps still floating around the net for Windows Mobile 2003, but if you have the money, as I didn't, I would suggest the Axim x50, the last of the Axim series Dell made.",5
"I bought this to go with my new Acer Aspire One.  I also wanted an external burner that is lightweight and small.  This one worked immediately right out of the box and is everything it is decribed to be.  Fast service from the seller with several pre-and post-shipping alerts from the seller, too.  A real pleasure.",5
"I couldn't use this drive with ACER's Aspire One eRecovery utility but have determined it is ACER's software problem, not a problem with the drive itself.  But what I learned in trying to get help from cBear was that (1) they can barely write English, (2) their first strategy is to send you all of the pre-written scripts that have nothing to do with your problem and, (3) if you persist, they will express doubt that there is a problem but will (grudgingly) agree to let you return the product.  I didn't need to do that because the drive works with software other that ACER's eRecovery but note that returns subtract 15% of the purchase price plus you pay for shipping.  I determined that the drive I received is an unlabeled OEM Toshiba drive and that's a respectable brand.",4
"I needed an external CDRW/DVD drive for my Toshiba NB205.The Acer Aspire One USB External DVD/CDRW CD Burner suits my need perfectly. For my purposes, a drive has to read and write disks reliably and quietly; that's it. I don't need it to be especially fast or to look pretty. Fortunately, for me this external drive is quiet, unobtrusive, and reliable.It has one eccentricity that I've found. It comes with two USB cables - one for data, one for power - and so you might find yourself in the position of connecting two USB cables from your laptop to this device. I do think it's weird. I've never seen this before.I've had no technical problems of any kind with this device. I am thoroughly satisfied.",4
"Not much to say here. Good value. Works as described. A little bigger than it needs to be, but does the job.",4

"I bought this because my COMPAQ DVD drive is not working too well. The External drive installed and seemed to do its stuff without any problems on WIN7. It comes with an extra USB cable to provide extra power to the drive if your primary USB port is not sufficient,On the ACER I use for streaming to my TV, it was just Plug in and use, no further installation was required, also a WIN7 machine.",4
"The Acer Aspire Netbook is sold with Windows XP operating system.  This DVD/CD burner is sold with the Windows ME driver, a generation behind the XP.  I tried downloading an updated driver from Microsoft, no go.  I tried contacting cBear, hoping they would support their product, NOTHING!  $25 paperweight is now what I have.  Amazon should drop cBear as a re-seller.  (It's not Microsoft's job to support cBear's hardware, it's cBear's job to support their product.  Not even ansering my email is not acceptable.)",1
"I bought this drive to go with my Netbook, since netbooks are too small for a drive with removable media. I based my decision on size, price, and the fact that you do not need to use two USB cables to power this up. This plays CD's and DVD's as well as any internal drive in a laptop. I can watch movies, play music and install software. No big deal to pack it with the Netbook and take it with you. Excellent product, would highly recommed.",5
I have had this for a couple months. Used it to load Win7 on a Acer Netbook. Worked just great.,5
Dont buy this unit. It is a dvd-rom and i needed a Dvd writer. It does not read Dvds but read Cd. Absolute waste of money.,1
I have a 10 1/2 in. computer with no disk drive and I needed to get my computer updated as much as possible.  This is working wonders and I am slowly cleaning my computer off of the old stuff and putting on new or updated programs.,5
I just re-read the details of this product and still can not find any mention of the fact that this device is a READ ONLY device and will not create/burn CDs or DVDs.  I'm very very dis-satisfied with the product and with Amazon for carrying it.,1
"I had no problem with my red DVD/CD player. I pluged it in and worked immediately in my three laptops.  I have a ten year old HP laptop that I don't use much, but I pluged the external USB in it just to see if it would work on an old one, and it worked fine. I bought this DVD/CD player to use with a netbook that I bought, but it has not arrived yet, so I can not tell if it will work in the netbook. If I have any problems with it I will update this review later on.",5
Drive simply will not mount. I imagine this must be fine for the person it works for but I'm returning mine as non-functioning.,2
"I must add this review since this is a great product at a ridiculously low price.I needed a CD/DVD player to install programs to my new netbook. Installation was easy; just pluged in the two usb cables and it worked immediately.I upload Microsoft Professional Office 2007 quickly and easily.  It does play movies, I played my Harry Potter Movie with no problems. The VLC media player was already installed. I highly recommend this player",5
"This external USB DVD/CD drive is perfect for netbooks and laptops needing an external drive to handle CDs and DVDs.  The drive itself is slim and light, ready to travel with your netbook.  It conveniently draws its operating power through the connecting cord to a netbook or laptop USB port.  Assuming your laptop or netbook has a media player, you should be ready to utilize this drive right out of the box.  The drive is not necessarily ruggedized, so some care with handling is advisable. Highly recommended.",4
This goes great with my ACER netbook.  I use it a lot to import things from other computers.  It makes things so much more convenient.,5
"Works as advertised. I needed a replacement for the internal drive on my Lenovo Y510 which had failed. Since the failure on the internal drive had happened before, I didn't want to deal with that again. Having an external drive is a little unhandy but once the OS had been loaded on it, an internal drive would be rarely needed.",5
"I use this thing way more than I thought I ever would. Great little product, can be a pain if your USB ports are to close together.",5
"I bought the blue one for my son's blue Toshiba netbook, and it matches exactly. It arrived with two cables and instructions, but I only needed the USB cable. I plugged it in, the driver software loaded, and it worked! It's small and quiet, and works perfectly for a great price.",5
"This external drive has helped me a lot, it comes in handy when your mac, notebook or netbook cd/dvd drive is not working.",5

"I have purchased a small laptop (netbook type) for use as a large tablet.  It has a touch screen and Windows 8 installed.  However, it does not have an optical drive (too small of a footprint).  To load some of my favorite programs requires a CD/DVD drive.  This unit meets that need very nicely.  It is effective, quiet and seems to draw minimum power with just one USB cable.",5
"I got this to use with a Linux based XBMC media center on a ZBOX as the DVD player. It was recognized out of the box. It plays DVDs great, until it just quits. I'll have to buy another drive as this one is not working for me.",2
This drive was not recognizable by either a Windows 7 PC or a Windows 8 tablet.  Got similar item ($5 more) from Microcenter and it was plug and play.,1
"It's okay and easy to use but feels a bit flimsy although I don't use it often, so I'm glad I have it. But haven't had great luck with DVDs and not sure if wrong type disc or what.",3
"i bought this to replace another external drive that was only a dvr (i needed a cd/cdrw/dvd).  i opened my very carefully wrapped and packaged drive and was pleased to see that it stated cd/cdrw/dvd right on the front of it!  i was unsure of the 2 cords as well, but i plugged them both into my dell netbook, and it worked right away.  the only thing i don't like is that when you eject, you have to kind of pull the tray out.  it also seems just a tad sensitive if you touch it while it's working.  other than that, a great deal and good product!",4

All I had to do was hook it to the laptop, and it worked very smoothly and easily. This is a solidly good product, and for a good price, and so far it is working very well. However I felt that it is a bit sensitive to the touch when it is working, so the user has to be a little careful with it.",4
I bought this external usb for my netbook and it works great for downloading programs. In fact I've been lending out to other family members. No complaints here.,5
It works fine to play DVDs.  Haven't used it in other applications yet.  As others have said you have to download a media player if you have Windows 8.  I used VLC media free download.,5
Sometimes cheap is good. You go a long way with your buck. With this machine I ended up spending more money since it malfunctioned ever since the beginning. My computer wouldn't even recognize the damn thing. I had to install a load of drivers and still it malfunctioned. I would recommend getting a pricier apparatus that is guaranteed working from the moment you plug it in.,2
I like it but it does take a minute to come on and is quite a pain going from one science to another.  Other than that it is okay!,3
"The description didn't say what brand the DVD drive was, so I assumed I would be getting a cheap Chinese generic drive. However, when I opened the package, it was a brand new LG drive! I was very thrilled to get that for only $25. The drive is very thin and made of aluminum. The drive features a slide-tray and works decently. I used it to install Microsoft Office 2007 and Star Wars Battlefront II on my Asus T101MT tablet pc without any issues. Plus, LG is a name-brand you can trust! I highly recommend this DVD drive as you get the best bang for you buck!",5
"I bought this external drive when the built-in drive on my computer died. Buying an external drive was cheaper than hiring a computer repair person to come to my home and put in a new drive. The drive works OK, nothing spectacular -- it appears a little flimsy, but so far, no problems. I rarely use it, but bought it for those times when I want to watch a DVD movie or install new software that is delivered on a CD.",4
Pros: Full system in a small case.Cons: having t use 2 usb portsto transfer and power system is a drawback.Overall a good external system,5
"I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.  The picture on my daughters Acer Aspire one Netbook is sharper than the one on my Acer Laptop with widescreen HD. If you are an Acer Netbook lover, this is the external player for you.  Just a reminder, it is not a DVD/CD burner.Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.  Total thumbs up for quality and performance!!!  I upgraded to 5 stars, simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far.  For the price you simply CANNOT go wrong!!!",5
No problems so far except unable to upload a program CD. Not sure if it was the CD/dvd my computer or the software but just that one disc.  That disc works in my desk top but not in this unit.  Not sure why.  All other dvd's and CD's have been working without a problem.,4
"This USB DVD/CD external drive works like a charm! Very simple to set up, have been using it with my iMac that does not have an internal disk drive. Computer recognized it immediately. The drive is very light and portable.",5
"Item Description says nothing about this item being a DVD/CD R/W unit.  However after reading reviews, many said they were burning CDs with this unit so I purchased it.The unit i received installed easy and was identified in  device manager as a SONY CD-ROM DDU810aWhen I opened my burning software, no writers were recognized.Specs on this unit indicate writing function as N/AApparenty this company is shipping different items under this description as others have said that their unit was imprinted with DVD/CD R/wThe unit i received says DVD-ROMIts a nice external portable unit for playing CDs and DVDsTHIS IS NOT B A BURNER",3
Basic dvd player for the computer. Plug it in and it works. So far so good.,4
could not get my Acer netbook to accept this device.returned it .Eventually got a true plug and play LG  one--had much more luck,1
"I bought this external dvd for my mini dell.It works great but it does NOT play all region dvds.IT ONLY PLAYS REGIONS 1......Kept trying to view some anime & regular cartoons, but no can do.Otherwise it's a ok  drive.",4
"I use CR123A batteries like candy, I didn't know they were rechargeable till a colleague of mine happened to have a set. I quickly got on amazon and found this kit which has been a life saver. The ability to charge them either from a 120 wall outlet or a 12V car charger is invaluable, particularly if travel between countries..",5
"Very powerful batteries, use it a lot and doesn't have to care about spare batteries, great price for the package",5
"These batteries are good and so is the charger. For my husbands police small flashlight, this is great, especially the car charger!",5
"This is a great kit, everything works as it should. Fast service from the seller. Didn't realize there was a car plug adapter included, this will come in handy.",5
"I haven't had these long, but they appear to work.  Only time will tell how long they hold a charge and how many times I can recharge them.  Price was good though.",4
"If you are like us, and you have tactical flashlites and night lights on your firearms, you know it is no fun to pay $10 for 2 to 3 hours of light. These pay for themselves in no time at all.With that said, I will repost if they fail early or quit retaining full charge. So far we have about 15 charges and recharges. We have had them for about 6 months.",5
Two of the batteries never worked. I contacted them about replacements and they wanted me to jump through so many hoops I just figured it was not worth the effort. Lesson learned.,1
"I needed a replacement battery for a Davis Weather Station, which uses solar cells to power the remote sensors.  After finding out that non-rechargeable batteries only lasted 2-3 weeks, the realization finally penetrated my thick skull that a solar cell won't do much for a non-rechargeable battery.  I bought this product, and am very happy with it. My weather station is happy again, the charger itself (which I've only used for the initial charge) worked quickly and without a hitch.  The product design is pleasant and fool proof.  I'm a satisfied customer.",5
"The batteries work and the recharger, recharges. You cannot ask for more so this product has my blessing. It was also a great buy and saved me some coin so it REALLY has my blessing!!! Thanks for providing a great product at a great price!!",5
"ORIGINAL: These batteries have been excellent for my flashlight and work four about 2 hours on Full Power.  Not much else to say except that these are great money savers for high powered lights like mine.UPDATE 9/14/2013:  These batteries are still running as strong as they were when I purchased them, so I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  They work great in my work light, Fenix TK35, which is a highly demanding power consuming unit.  I completely recommend these for anyone who is a LEO, EMS or similar line of work.",5
"I made the mistake of abandoning my normal principal of ""you get what you pay for""I was excited to find these so inexpensively and had planned to use them in my SU-800 master controller for photography.  The ""quality"" batteries for this unit average around $16.00 each, so the idea of getting four batteries with a charger cheaper than the cost of two normal batteries was just appealing to my ""green sense"".Now I'm back to the single use batteries, as these rechargeable's let me down time and again...  when freshly charged, they often showed voltage ratings well above 4v and this isn't workable in my units.  So, I let them run down a tad and they are usable for a blink, then run down quickly under normal use.Also, if they are not equally discharged and charged in twos, the charger will show both charged, while they are not equal upon removal... one battery showing a voltage rating of 2.2 and the other 4.0 fresh from the charger.I consider this to be a real problem and potentially damaging sensitive equipment if using a battery that actually has a overcharged condition.  Batteries rated at 3 volts shouldn't show over 4 while in service.... and again, drain quickly.I should get 1000 cycles from my SU-800 by Nikon with a fresh battery... with these, it's more like 150-ishVery disappointed.I can't provide a review of how these batteries perform in other equipment, but if you need something that performs as ""rated"" with meaningful performance life, based on my experience with this group... please continue shopping for something better.Smart Charger-  charges unpredictably3.0V batteries hold unstable charges (based on my experience with those shipped to me)Charged life- very short, around 20% of that of a normal single use battery (based on the group I received)If you need something quick and cheap for equipment with a broad operating range, then you may get something out of these.  I just can't personally recommend them.Sorry.",3
"I bought some of these to try with a light using 123 A's. They work as advertised. When you check them with a meter they show over 3 volts, but under load they do not hurt the light. Have been using them for a while now. Hold a charge VERY well, and no longer have to buy throw away 123A's.",5
These batteries work flawlessly. The charger is why I dropped a star. Sometimes it doesn't recognize the batteries.,4
"I bought these for use in my flashlights, Steripen Adventurer, and MSR MiOx.  The chargers work better than the solar counterparts but any use overseas you better take the solar chargers.  Still, they arrived quickly and have worked well every time.",5
"I've had this kit for a few months now and have recharged a pair of the batteries 3 times, and a third battery once. So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 (Luxeon Rebel LED, 11 - 200 lumens), and a Fenix P1 CE (Cree 7090 XR-E LED - 90 lumens). For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 1-1/2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels I'm using. I don't use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so that's plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included, too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 11-14-09I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles (which is what is supposed to happen), so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11-17-2010I guess it's time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but that's because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer (2010). I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off (that how you replace the battery). I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well, it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery. I didn't have anything to lose so I trimmed off the plastic that was torn, and sealed the case up with some super glue. Fortunately, the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine - still had a full charge! I've since charged it twice and it is still working great. STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4
Run time in my regulated JetBEAM flashlight was about 40% of what it should be with these batteries which were freshly charged. Well under powered and capacity. They're going to be replaced immediately with any battery other than this one. These batteries will see second string duty.,2
The charger took about 4 hours to give two RC123A 3.0V 900mAh Rechargeable Li-Ion Protected Batteries a charge of 100%. So for 4 batterys figure 8 hours. I only use one at a time so that's roughly four nights on my NOD.Additional information - I used it by doing a direct plugin to my solar charger and it powered up two RC123A batteries to 90% charge in an 11 hour (sunrise till sunset) day.The link for the Amanzon solar charger is:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H36S0G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_sol_prd_title#sf,5
This is exactly what I needed for my SU-800 wireless flash commander. It sure beats buying these batteries as often as I was. I definitely recommend it.,5
"Got one for home, and one for the car.  Work great, but sometimes don't last as long as the non-rechargeable versions.  Great for training days for my tactical lights, as I can use one up and grab another from the charger.",5
"After just two cycles of the batteries, they stopped working in my tactical flashlight.  I measured the voltage and found them to be almost 4.2 volts fully charged (when it is supposed to be 3.0!!!).  I don't know if this can damage a voltage regulated light, but I'm not willing to take the chance (they don't work in two separate types of flashlights I have anyway because they immediately shut off when turned on with these batteries now).  I'm returning these and buying some surefire non-rechargeable batteries.  What good is a tactical flashlight if at the exact moment you need it to work, the batteries fail?  And if you aren't using it for tactical purposes, then why get a light with CR123A batteries in the first place?Even when this charger WAS working (only on the first cycle), it got way too hot for comfort while charging and took way longer than it says.  Also, the light turns halfway to green but stays halfway red, and doesn't charge both batteries evenly.",1
"Do NOT buy these batteries and this little 'handy kit' if you want a battery you can RELY on.  My experience using them in flashlights (Fenix, Sure Fire, etc) has been dismal.  Full charge = one hour of 'strobe'.  Contacted vendor and was told that ""these cells vary"" and that ""replacing them wouldn't help"".....so WHAT WOULD HELP?!?!Basically, the vendor says that these cells are worthless and unreliable.  Is that what you're looking for?  Go elsewhere.  The battery sucks and the vendor sucks.",1
Imagine that you dont have to worry that you forgot to turn your flash off or it got flipped on in your camera bag. Imagine you never have to worry that your battery will die on you.And it came fast in great packagaing.Thanks.,5
"I bought these to power my wife's first high output LED flashlight. They did work, but did't last nearly as long as I'd expected. The charger worked fine and we had no real issues with the batteries, we just weren't impressed.I ended up replacing each pair with a single Panasonic 3100 mA 18650 battery and have been much happier. We ended up giving these away, along with the flashlight to my step-daughter when we upgraded the wife's flashlight to something with a little more punch.",3
"The right charge slot works fine, but the left one insists on flashing (indicating bad cell) when ever I use it, even with cells that charge fine in the right slot.  Since I only need to charge one cell at a time, I can live with it, but it's peculiar.",3
Charges quickly. very good set for the price. will review more when field tested. using it for my tactical flashlight used for LE work.,5
"I bought this for my iPod 2G. I wanted to take advantage of Skype calling my family. The mic itself is small, about as big as a horse pill or a paperclip to you youngins who don't know that a horse pill is any big a** pill you try to swallow...LOL I have a little pouch in my purse I keep it in so I don't lose it...because you will lose it. The sound was good when I recorded a voice memo. But you have to remove it to hear anything back. THAT's the kicker!It's a restriction of the device, not the mic. I thought I could use the mic to speak and my Bluetooth headphones to listen at the same time. No such luck. You have to get the iPod headphones with built in mic/recorder to do that. So all I can use this for is to record stuff and listen later. But it was cheap, so it's still a cool addition to my toys. Oh, and I also got the iPod headphones with mic... those too live in my little pouch of goodies...LOL",5
"Worked well for my older iPods, but it was purchased to enhance iPhone recording. However, there is no increased quality or functionality with the iPhone over the built in mic.",3
"Works as advertised.  A bit large, so interferes with plugging in usb charge cord.  And, of course, with this plugged in it turns off the speakers.",3
"This little microphone transforms my iPod into something much more useful for recording events.  There is no way to listen at the same time, but that was advertised as such.  Thank you.",5
I just got my mini mic and my Chill Pill Rapcap in the mail today.I bought both for my iPod Class 120gig for recording lectures. I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me $.34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but I'm confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine. I have a flip open case so I can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great.Only complaint I have is that I bought the Rapcap too.,5
"When I wanted to use my iPod to record some reminders to myself I looked around for a compatible microphone expecting to pay $25 to $50 or more and having a twenty page instruction book to study, but then I found this little gem at a great price and no instruction book to study and it works like a charm for me, just plug it in and go. I wish all tech stuff could be this easy.",5
Ipod 5G/5.5G DO NOT SUPPORT LIN IN MICROPHONES!!!!!!DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE A 6g 120GB,1
"We received our order in three days which was super fast.  The microphone that we received is actually white but that is not an issue for us. We put it on our 5-6 year old I-pod touch that our son plays with so that he can play all of his talking animal games.  Despite reviews that stated it didn't work because the I-pod thinks there are headphones in, we have not had that issue with any of our talking games  with the exception of the talking Angela game.  I put the mic in and rebooted the I-pod and it worked perfectly.  I thought perhaps I would have to remove the case based on other reviews but there was no issue there either.  I was actually ready to take my I-pod to the Apple store and see if we could have a mic added but this $3.00 dollar microphone was the answer for us.",5
I have a ipod touch i bought this item before i realized that my ipod already has a built in mic and so haven't used this mic and never needed it.,3
These work for the itouch 64gb but they sometimes skip when recording. You can not hear what you are recording. The sound quality is okay.. I did get this product fast through the mail.,3
This products work for what i was using it for (an old iPod touch). I'm pleased but this is VERY easy to lose.,5
Wouldn't buy this again.  I never really used the product because it didnt fit the phone that well with the phone case on.,2
"i bought my mic from crazyfrog, not expecting that great of a mic due to the price. it shipped very fast, and i recieved it in perfect condition. it works just as well as, if not better than, my mic that came with an iphone. it works great with my ipod touch 2nd generation mc model. i would strongly advise anyone to buy this who's looking for a high quality mic at a low price. dont let those bad reviews scare you!! i dont know about the quality from other sellers, but crazyfrog delivered mine in perfect condition. great buy.",5
"I gave this five stars because for the price, this tiny microphone is excellent.  I needed a small unobtrusive mic to record university lectures to my 3rd Generation iPod Touch.  I can report that this mic works perfectly.If you need fancy cut offs, filters, or you expect concert quality results, please go elsewhere.  If you want something that works well for much less than $10, get this mic or get a couple of them.",5
"This mic sounds surprisingly great! It picks up a wide range of frequencies very nicely! My only complaint is that it is easy to lose, but there's nothing the manufacturer could do about that.",5
"I purchased from 24hourdispatch-Global and it arrived quickly.  The microphone was readily accepted by my iPod touch 3G and allows me to make Voice Memos.  I also tried it for a Skype call and it works!  Note other reviewers have noted you can't both have it in the iPod touch to use as a microphone and hear sound from the speakers - this is a limitation of the iPod touch, and I refuse to give this item a negative review based on the limitations of the iPod touch like so many others have.  You CAN use it to make a Skype call, and both speak into the microphone and hear through the speakers if you set the call to ""speaker,"" either when making or receiving a call.  It's about the size of a very large pill.  I'm very pleased with the seller and the item.",5
"Small, compact, easy to carry around.  Followed the instructions and it worked perfectly.  It's not a broadcast quality microphone, but for everyday voice use it's a great, portable solution.",5
"Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...",2
"When I bought my Itouch a few years back, I didnt like the fact that it had no mic.  So I started doing some searching here on amazon.com and I found one and still have it today.  i was able to PTT ( PRESS TO TALK) LIKE A WALKIE TALKIE AND OTHER stuff. I like it.",5
...you must unplug the microphone unit to hear any replay/sounds.  I'll hack it in the future in order to allow sounds while it's plugged in.,4
Didn't work on my iPhone or iPods. Loved that it is compact. Wasn't out much money luckily. Do not recommend.,1
This an awesome product.  It was cheap and works well.  I use it to record lectures in college so I can listen to them again.,4
It works perfect. The only thing is it is so small. lol. like I think I have seriously swallowed medications larger than this device. Good item. Would recomend to anyone.,5
I love this mic it works on itouch 3generation 8 gb so well. I love it too much and wat a money saver too . Nothing more to say but to order it soon!!!,5
"Received this item today.  Plugged it in and thought that I should have read the reviews first. But there were also alot of good reviews.  So, I tried to think what was going on, plugging it in first it said ""no microphone"" when I went to my recording app.  I don't know if it did not go in all the way with the case on my Ipod, but I had to charge it and when I tried again with the case off, it did work.  IN ORDER TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HAVE RECORDED, YOU HAVE TO DISCONNECT THE MICROPHONE. Made sure it was pushed in all the way when I put the case back on.",5
"This is a very good seller. The product arrived exactly on the estimated date of arrival. The only problem I have is that the mic has no speakers, so you need to unplug it to listen to the ipod again.",5
useless piece of device for a device that already has a mic... the performance is very average...!!! looks smooth tho.,1
I thought I could use something like this to enhance the tiny pin hole mic on my tablet but this thing is actually worse.  When doing a test recording the pin hole mic on the tablet was 5-6 times as loud during playback and the fidelity of the sound was higher from the built in tablet mic.  About the only way to could get anything to even register was to speak directly into the holes on this mic from an inch away.,1
"It does not work. When you plug it in, it disables the speakers and then the iPod is practically silent. Not a good idea.",1
I needed this for my iPod Touch and also ordered a few extras because I lose little things easily. This mic has provided much use and definitely of better quality than I was expecting it to be. I've even recommended this to a couple of friends.,5
"sensitivity is slightly on the low side...records loud static noise every three seconds...otherwise, it's a good product...",4
"This item works with an I-phone 4, 4s and a Samsung Galaxy S3.  The microphone picks up sound 10 time better than the built in phone mic.  The shipping time was a little long but that is clearly stated when you purchase it.  This lets you use your phone as a digital recorder.  I will buy another one",4
"As a microphone this thing works fine. However if you are trying to turn your itouch into a skype phone forget it as the volume on itouch just isn't loud enough. I have found out that the only way to use the itouch as s skype phone is to use the headphones that include a mic. And then if you have skype in, forget it because you will never hear the thing ring. But the mic works and it is little money.",2
Good product does the job. Good price. It has a carrying case. I used for the ipod  does a good job.,5
"I plugged it in and it worked. It is small, but taking it with you is a challenge. How about making it into a key chain?",4
"this is a fantastic tool if you are recording anything from Business meetings, you can even use it for the app Shazam... it really cool. not for use for the voip though...",5
"This microphone does what it states, but nothing more. It does record sound, and that can be very handy for an iDevice, but at the cost of the external speakers (if it has one) being shut off. The original reason I bought this was for the use of Skype, but I can't due to the speakers getting shut off. Also, the size can be helpful (not a obstruction), but it is also easily losable.PROS-Records sounds-Compact**CONS-No speaker when in use-CompactIn the end, buy this if you need it for the voice memos, shazam, an certain voice apps, but with other applications, such as Skype,this won't do very well.",3
"It's simple and works well for me. Sellers say you have to purchase an additional app, but mine works fine with the included 'Memo' app on my iPod Touch 2G. Down side is that you have unplug it to listen to the recording.",4
I use this product all the time since I am on Voxer.  I needed a microphone and this product is great because it is small and not as noticeable.  I really love it,5
I don't know what I was thinking buying this piece of junk.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Invest in quality and stay away from this thing.  Seriously.,1
Nice add on for those who have an iPod Touch.  Not a miracle worker but provides microphone capability.,4
SD Ultra Micro SDXC card has worked without flaw so far.  It's been trouble-free up to this point in transfering and managing all my audio files (~29GB) from my HP laptop to my Samsung Note 10.1 2014 Edition.  I've also purchased compatible SD micro cards for my Samsung Galaxy III cell phones which have worked out better than the Kingston cards that I had originally purchased.,5
"i like it, but a little expensive compared to others i saw online after purchasing.  Other than that, it's good.",4
"I bought this on March 4th, 2014. Suddenly even thought the Storage in settings showed the card with used and free space, no app could find any files on it. Had to dismount, remove it and reinsert it for it to work, BUT it is erratic! While in the middle of playing mp3s on it, all the files disappeared.. This is happening over and over. Very disappointing!",1
"I had a couple of problems with having to reset my device so it could read the sd card before.  I like to save any applications I can to it to save room on my device.  Worked great for a couple of months after that.  Then since yesterday, it just stopped reading and started saying damaged card and try to format.  I formatted it, and it still wont read the sd card.  This was a horrible waste of my money.  I am very upset.",1
Works as described. Have not had an issue with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. There was a surprise when it arrived though: there was an SD adapter card with it. Did not read that in the description when I ordered the card.,5
"Just got back from a week in London and Paris. I used this adapter to power my HP laptop and I used it's built-in USB port to charge my Blackberry Bold, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch with no problems at all. The built-in lights are really handy. The power light lets you know it's plugged into a working AC wall plug. I found that not all plugs in the Chicago and Houston airports are working, so having the light was really handy for finding a working outlet. The second, USB, light gets brighter or dimmer as power is pulled by the USB device. For example; when my Blackberry was plugged in and recharging, the light glowed somewhat dimmly, but when I made a call, the light glowed more brightly. So you can tell when you have a good connection to your USB device.Overall, it's well built and easy to operate. I'll be keeping this in my travel bag.",4
"Ordered Sept. 2012 from another company on Amazon for $5.24 which included shipping. I sent it with a gift to someone in the UK.Item is finished well, the different interlocking plugs cleverly designed and fit together snugly. Came with instructions and carrying pouch.Only trouble I had when testing it here before sending it was pushing my computer's power cord plug into the AC receptacle. Very difficult at first to force it without it seeming it would break but after many tries finally got it.  Much easier after that.The USB slot and its light worked, but the second light for the AC receptacle did not. However, the receptacle worked fine and charged my computer through it.The USB light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged. Also, another switch was shown in the instruction diagram (I don't remember what it was supposed to be for) that wasn't on the adapter.Recipient uses the USB slot to charge a camera and MP3 player and reports it is working fine for those devices. Thrilled to have the EU plug too.If it lasts, great product and VERY cost effective.",4
"I purchased 2 Universal Travel AC Wall Adapters, with USB Charger, for my daughters' trips to Europe.  Both units worked for about 1 day or less, when they stopped working during use.  They used them with dual voltage camera battery chargers.  I had also given them straight plug adapters.  Thank God that I did!  The straight plug adapters, which I bought in 1999, still worked, and lasted them the rest of the trip.  Good thing I also included USB charger units.  So they could not charge 2 items at the same time, since the new wall adapters broke, but they got their gadgets charged with the other plugs.I put in a request to return these to the seller (HandHelditems).  And they did NOT honor it because I bought it a few months back, but the kids' trips were not until the past few weeks.  I guess I should have tried them out after we first got them.",1
"This product does NOT deserve the 2 stars the other reviewers gave it.  One reviewer got the wrong product, apparently (which has to do with the seller), while the other doesn't seem to realize that the USB port is for charging peripherals, NOT a computer.Pros:-has basically all plug adapters you need built-in or easily removable.-compact-sturdy, good quality plastic, kind of like Lego-decent USB power port rated at 500mA-lights for AC Power and USB powerCons:-does not ground-instructions say 110V-250V, but unit says 100-250V. Should work in Japan, but haven't tested it.Notes:*Do not pay full price at a retailer for this item! I got mine from the seller in this listing. It was delivered in a simple bubble-envelope with instruction sheet, no maim-shell packaging.*I LOVE the lights on this thing.  You can plug in and know right away if there is AC.*Furthermore, the USB lights up depending on the current being drawn and thus flickers when something is trickle-charging.  Know what this means? It means you can tell AT A GLANCE if your device is 95% charged!!! Do NOT top-off your battery-powered devices to 100%! The ""memory effect"" is a myth.  The real culprit is topping-off your battery.  Charge your devices until the USB flickers and then remove them.*keep in mind that, as with all modern plug converters, your primary device must be rated to use 100-250V mains power.  This adapter will NOT step-up or step-down voltage (unnecessary with modern electronics).The only possible improvements to this would be if there was an extra USB port or if it was somehow rotatable.This thing kicks ASS and is a great bargain compared to the other name-brand junk out there that is either over-priced or over-priced AND doesn't have USB power.",5
"These are great, the USB port is especially handy. Small size, and all the adapters I could want. At first it seemed to light to do it's job but it is working great. It is the only adapter that I use when travelling.",5
"This is very handy and it charges two things at once easily. I usually charge my laptop and iPod touch in this at the same time and have not had problems with it so far. It also has all of its individual parts for the various plugs it is capable of fitting in all contained within itself, which is very handy because you don't have to remember where you put the EU plug or the US plug, etc!",5
"These were a life-saver! I bought 2 of these and I was a little unsure of the quality based on the price of this item, but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked for me over 6 weeks in Europe and UK.  Stayed in over 22 hotels and on a train sleeper car and never had a problem.  I travel with a CPAP breathing machine and it was critical to have power every night so I could sleep.  I also had an iPhone and my brother had an iPad and the USB charger was great for both.  I could also use one plug to both power the CPAP and charge the iPhone.  It was really nice to have the red lights that indicated that you had power since many outlets in Europe and UK have some sort of switch that turns the power off to each individual outlet.  Also, on the train, the red light wast coming on and let me know that the outlet wasn't working.  I worked with the conductor to get some circuit breakers on the train reset by letting him know when the red light came back on.  That was quite a time saver and great tool for that purpose.The only negative I have is that the part that holds the US plug into the device could be a little more snug.  It felt like it was going to fall out at times (and did fallout 1-2 times but that wasn't much over 6 weeks of use).There is one design enhancement that I would have put into this device: When using the UK converter, they could have made the bottom of the device a 2nd 110 outlet so that you would have 2 110 outlets (the regular one on the back and one on the bottom using the Euro converter) as well as the USB outlet.  Of course this may be over the amperage that one plug should carry, but it's a thought for the designers.",5
"I bought this device so I can use my laptop and charge my phone during travel to other European countries. But few hours after using it, the fuse blew up and the device didn't work after that. Very disapppointed.",2
"Product was shipped quickly from Toy 4 Kids. At first, I loved it. It's compact, has all kinds of adapters, and very lightweight -- seemed perfect for travel. My first night in Italy, it plugged right in and charged both my camera battery (in regular outlet) and ipad (using the USB port). Unfortunately, after the 2nd night, there were faint black burn marks on the white plastic and it failed to charge anything else after that. Burnt out after just 2 nights?  In short, great idea but very little durability.",1
"We are heading to Europe this summer.  Of course, we'll have an array of electronic devices with us (camera, kindle, phones, etc.) and I wanted to make sure we could keep things charged as needed during our trip no matter where we ended up.  This is a perfect solution at a very affordable price.",5
"Once upon a time I travelled with a heavy current converter and a handful of plugs to fit a variety of sockets outside the U.S., all in a bulky case.  Now that so many electrical devices have dual voltage, the issue is to find a convenient plug adapter, and this one fits the bill.  It's very cleverly designed so that all the plugs snap together into a single compact unit - no more lost parts! - and it has the added benefit of a USB port for charging MP3 players & the like.  Add to that a super-reasonable price, and I don't know how you could ask for more.",5
It is good and as expected. I love to have it with me for my international travel.I love it.,5
"This adapter is a very good investment. I've used this in Europe, Korea, Ethiopia (Africa)and the U.K. and it has not missed a beat. I really like the extra USB plugs. They work so well that I no longer carry an extra AC to USB adapter. It does have an internal fuse that cannot be replaced, but I have yet to encounter a problem.I plan to get another one.NOTE.. This is only an adapter, not a voltage converter. Most outlets outside of the USA are 220. So be sure what you plug in is duel voltage. Most cell phone chargers and laptops are duel voltage.EDIT: I've uploaded some pictures, please feel free to view.",5
"We have two of these and recently used them in both Ireland and Sweden. It includes plugs for UK, US, European, and Australian style plugs. Contrary to what one other reviewer says here, it does really support Australian plugs. To use it on an Australian outlet with the angled slots, just twist the blades of the US plug.The fuse in one of ours was blown while trying to run a hair dryer on it. I have removed the fuse and ordered replacements. When I get it working again, I'll post an update. It is marked as a 3 A, 250 V fast blowing fuse, which means that this is rated for about 750 W. That's about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer, so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question, but it's more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carry.The red indicator LEDs are helpful to know that it's working, but they are fairly bright, so if bright LEDs in a small hotel room are a distraction from sleeping, plan ahead to cover them up with something.Update: I replaced the blown fuse with one of these:QUALITY USA brand fuses!! Set of 5 pieces, 3AG3A250V, F3AL250V, F3A 250V, F3 L250V, F3A 250V, F3L250V cartridge GLASS fuses 6X30mm (1/4 in x 1-1/4 in) , 3A 250V, Fast-blow (Fast Acting). Everything appears to be working fine, and I now have 4 spares to take with me on my next trip.",5
"The usb charger socket was totally broken and never worked. I'm not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but I never saw either of them turn on either. It was difficult to fit grounded US plugs in without some serious shoving, and the fakey plastic ground doesn't retract so I couldn't use it on outlets that didn't have a ground socket (common in Hong Kong). It's also quite big and heavy to travel with.",2
"I'm in Europe right now using this, and it hasn't let me down. I use it every morning to heat water with a immersion heater I insert in my coffee mug to make coffee each day. At other times I use it to charge my kindle, backup batteries, camera and cellphone.I wish I had purchased 2 so I can use more than one outlet at a time. I did bring along an extension cord, but adding more than one gadget to it slows down the charging rate. Using 2 outlets is more efficient. I'm buying an additional one for my next trip.Highly recommend this one, as it is very versatile with the USB port.",5
"Great product but is not true as they say that it charges ipads, it does not charge them at all, i would rate this a perfect 5 stars if it did, its a pitty.",4
"There's not much to say, other than that the price was exceptional. The adapter set is compact and appears durable. I really wanted the USB charger plug, and figured I might as well get a complete adapter set into the bargain.",5
This is a cable.  It allows power to be transfered from and outside source to my Nexus 7.  It functions exactly as advertised.,5
"Cord worked great for awhile, but had recently not been working up to snuff. Can't understand how a cord like this can go bad in three months. It should last a lot longer than that. Won't keep my tablet fully charged when connected to the docking station. Switched back to the OEM cable, and what do you know? It's charging again.Definitely going to have to find a different cable.EDIT 10/1/2013: Nope, the cable is fine. It works great as an OTG cable...I was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone, as well as add files to my Nexus 7. It was actually the cheaply-made $9 Chinese charger I had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad. When I put this cable on my Nexus' OEM charger, it worked just fine. I do believe I'll be purchasing another Nexus 7 OEM charger in the near future.",5
Described as a better cable than the one that came with the Tablet. Not so! Mini USB doesn't fit and cord is very short. Sending it back ASAP.,1
"Original Review: This cable does the job but beware if you are looking for anything longer than the ASUS brand cable that came with the Nexus 7 It's the same length. But the price is right and the cable seems sturdy enough.Update: We recently made a trip and I took this cable along, along with the original ASUS charger. Big mistake! As noted in other reviews the cable was incredibly slow in charging my Nexus 7. I left it plugged in overnight and it was only at 22% the next morning. When I returned home I tried the charger with this cable and found that after 10 minutes the batter charge increased from 85% to 86%. Using the same charger and the original ASUS cable for the same 10 minutes, the battery had increases from 86% to 89%. I left the Nexus 7 connected to the charger with the ASUS cable and it reached 100% charge after about an hour.The cable works fine for copying music and image files back and forth from my PC but it is sorely deficient as a charger cable. Ergo the downgrade in my rating from 4 to 2 stars.",2
not worth your stress...fit loosely from the get go...I have two nexus 7 tablets and it was the same with both. went to wal-mart and bought a cheap generic one and it works great.,1
"It looks just like the real thing, however it does not hook into the port as well as the original one. Not a big issue considering the price.Google is selling those for way too much, they will not get my money for such overpriced item.",4
"This cable is fine, except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending. I dropped my nexus 7 from a height of 1 foot onto my bed and it bent about 45. Your best bet is the official nexus 7 charger, but beware, the USB and the cable have almost entirely seperated on the cable that came with my Nexus 7.",1
"A big improvement from the stock cord provided with the device, liked it so much I am going to buy several more,because I take my nexus everywhere",5
Perfect additional memory for my Samsung Galaxy 4 smart phone.  Easy to install and transfer data.  Could have not asked for anything better.,5
"I bought 2 of these thinking they were somehow specially formatted for the S4. I suppose I was naive. I could have purchased the same item, for less, with the 'special format.Yes, good product and works fine the phone. Special? No.",3
She put it in her Samsung Galaxy 4 phone to be able to hold more pictures and data and hopefully not lose it if she breaks her phone again,5
"Now so far I've only tested it out on a computer as my tablet has still not arrived(shipped out a week ago). So I will update when I get to test it out on the tablet as well. It works great, a bit slow in transfer items from my computer, but that's to be expected on my old laptop, so no problems there either. 16 gb, only 14 can be used on mine, but that is still more than enough space for me, since I only plan on storing apps, and ebooks on it, along with a few movies(maybe). Will look to buy this again if I need more room, or if my mom needs one.Update: Received Tablet today, and popped this in, works great, reads really fast! Great for holding my books, movies, and apps that I don't want taking space on the tablet.",5
"My last memory card for my Galaxy S4 got some water damage on a camping trip a few months ago, which became apparent when all my photos became inaccessible/got deleted. I needed a fairly large and reliable memory card to replace it. I've had this microSD card for a few months now, and it has been great! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable way to store data, especially photos on the Galaxy S4.",5
"I bought this for my son's GoPro and it's worked out great. I just wish I would have bought the 64gb instead of going cheap on the 32gb, but so far so good. He's a couple of months into using his camera with this card and no issues.",5
Purchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a 16gig. Got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare Amazon first. Haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait. Was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store price.,5
This card is very good. I use it in my Gopro because that need a fast writing and reading. I recommend it.,5
"I needed a class 10 card for my GOPRO and this one looked like the best deal for the size ,and I have always liked the Sandisk brand .",5
The micro sd card worked with no problem whatsoever. The adapter that came with it did not work at all. Luckily i had an extra.,4
This card works well with my GoPro. Lots of storage space in a small package. The price was fair for a SanDisk product.,4
Bought this for my new Gopro and away we go. Great SD card at a great price...love it love it love it.,5
I liked it. I is already formatted and no need for formatting it. My galaxy s4 recognized it easily and easy to use. The only reason I gave 4 star because it is not 32G as stated and it is only 29g. I don't know if that is supposed to be or not. I am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body . You won't never regret .,4
Very High Quality and what a deal! Fast shipping. I trippled the memory on my Galaxy S4 for only $22.90  ship. Anyway now i can have all my music and videos and pictures on my new external memory and my phone runs great. I have the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch so I needed more room to install programs for the gear. Awesome deal!,5
"this is OEM from Kingston.  i've had other data storage items from them.  all good.  this one, too.  have not used the adapter.",4
"Bought this since it said it was specifically formatted for the Galaxy S4, and for the first 2 months it was working fine.  Bought it to replace a SanDisk 64gb MicroSDHC card that was prone to have problems.After approx 2 months, the card stopped reading in the phone.  I tried other cards and they worked in the phone.  The Kingston MicroSDHC card was dead and will not even read in my laptop or desktop computer, using different SD card readers.  I can't format it, can't even read it in the Disk Management viewer, and can't do anything with the card now.  Thousands of pictures and videos are now lost and that doesn't make me happy at all.  JUNK card.FYI, I put the 64gb SanDisk card back in and that's been working great ever since.",1
"This is a good, inexpensive option for my camera. It works perfectly. Amazon sells it for less. Kingston is a reliable brand.",5
"I FINALLY have more than enough storage on my phone...more than I will probably ever need!!If others are like me, they save zillions of graphics, apps, pictures, videos, etc....and the constant warnings on my screen that I am almost out of room drive me crazy! ;)So...as much as I can, I add to my SD card & voila! no more warnings...even after all that I have in there, I still have between 28-29GB of room open...I don't think I will EVER be able to use it all up lol.Shipper was fast & the price was not too bad...so glad I ordered this card!!! :)",5
Slipped right into my Galaxy 4S and was able to transfer all media from my previous card to this one. Allows me to use my phone without worrying about running out of storage.,5
Fast delivery.  Works as described and does the job. Kingston reputation was final decision maker.  Would buy again.  Using with Samsung Galaxy S4.,5
"I used it for my Galaxy S4 for a good 6 months without any problems. And just today.. It's died. Won't work at all, can't recover any files, can't even format it to re-use it. It is now a worthless tiny chip... Thanks, Kingston. Won't be using this product again. Any one else who plans on using this for a phone, especially a Samsung, I would recommend you buy Samsung's brand for the SD card. I should have done that from the start, but I wasn't even aware they made an SD card brand at the time. (I should have known.. Samsung makes everything!)",1
"I bought the 32 gig. card for just that purpose, My Samsung phone, takes as good pictures as most cameras. In fact I like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the s-4. I would buy it again and again if I needed a lot of memory. I recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera. I like to take moving photos with my Samsung, and those 8 second runs take a lot of memory, now I don't have to worry and running out of memory",4
We bought two of these micro cards for my wife's new Samsung Galaxy 4 cell phone since she takes a lot of pictures and we wanted a second micro card for backup.  All I can say is that the card works well in the Samsung cell phone.,5
Fit inthe phone and worked fine.  It is tough to get enthusiastic about memory except as one ages and loses theirs.,4
Nice pack. Installed easily in my galaxy S4. Works great.. Instead of paying $100 for a 32gb phone get a 16Gb phone and add the SD card...,5
"Ordered this to leave connected to an HDMI port on the upstairs TV so my wife could connect her tablet to the TV. It works great and appears well made and should last a long time, especially where only the mini-HDMI connector will the inserted and removed multiple times. No issues with it being loose, weak, or ready to break. Hard to beat the price with a nominal shipping charge. It arrived in its own bag inside of a shipping bag in perfect condition, and the shipping was exactly when they said it would be.",5
Digital works or it doesn't (despite Monster Cable's hooey). This works and the price is right.,5
This cable for under $7 was every bit as good as the ones sold in camera stores for $40+ dollars.  I'm very happy with my purchase.,5
The cable works as advertised and the price is unbeatable. I am not using it for a camcorder but for a canon elph camera with HDMI out. The photos and videos look great,5
Bought this hoping it would be as good as the $20 one at Staples. For the price...why not try it? Works great. No graininess. No interruption of transmission. Perfect length for my purposes. They must have just had an abundance and wanted to get rid of them because they are top quality.,5
"Just to give you a brief history, I had contacted CITI electronics before buying this product, if it is going to be compatible with my Canon HF200 video camera. Their response; YES. Considering how much the original one costs, I went the cheaper route; and it bit me right back. THIS CABLE DOES NOT WORK. Citi electronics lied (Just another California bases electronics retailer selling Chinese junk). Now, they expect me to pay for shipping even if the product is defective. Wonder if Amazon even goes through a selection process anymore. Overall, a very very bad experience. Never buying anything from Citi electronics again. Will have to buy original canon cable. There should be a way of actually making it zero star.",1
I needed an hdmi cable to connect my camcorder to the flat screen tv.  Did not wanted to hassle and see it on rca cables.  Cables work and were cheap.,5
Prompt shipping. On time delivery. Excellent quality cable. Tested using my Canon SX 40 and it worked really well for images and for video. Good buy and great price.,5
What pay $50 for a Canon brand cable when you can get this one for under $10 and the quality is just as good. I highly recommend this mini HDMI cable.,5
this cable lets me show pictures and videos from my camera through my TV monitor.  Easy to use.  Clean picture.  It does what it's supposed to do.,5
We use this cable to hook our camera to the RV TV.  Works well and is long enough to be able to see at a table and operate the device.  The photos look nice on a large screen.,5
"Can view my pictures right from my Cannon 4Ti on my big screen TV with this.  It works great, but be sure to follow Cannon's directions.  You must have the cable connected and have the TV on before turning on the camera.  It is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good pictures.",5
"And I like the length....makes it much easier to make the connection between the cfamera and the TV.  My TV is mounted high on the wall, so length is essential if the camera is not to be dangling.  I haven't yet used the cable, but it appears to be strong and flexible.",4
This HDMI cable is perfect for sending image and video from my digital camera to my HDTV. Being told that it isn't necessary to spend outrageous money on HDMI cable has proven true. I now have several inexpensive HDMI cables that work perfectly. I would purchase additional cables from this seller in the future.,5
Works flawlessly to connect my new Canon camera to all the HD TVs that I have hooked it to.  Great pics and vids and sound.,5
Works just like my shorter cables only with more optional length.  A good price for adding distance flexibility for camera to TV hookup when viewing pictures.,5
I bought this to use with my Canon G10 camera. The Canon version costs about $40. This one works perfectly. No reason to pay a penny more.,5
"The cable is doing just what it is suppose to do. The connectors fit snuggly into the HDMI input on the TV and the output of my Canon 5D, Mark II. Saved a lot of money vs. the cable offered by Canon.",5
Just what I wanted to review photos on my camera via my HD TV.  I can sit across the room from the TV and get an excellent view.,5
"Works great to connect my Canon 60d or t5i camera to an HD TV. I directly connected it to two of my TV's and it works perfectly. When I connected it to a 3 port HDMI switch, it did not work. The price is great.",3
this cable does work with my 5D Mark iii and my canon point and shoot...Audio seems a little off ... not sure if it is the cable or not... I mean it does not sound as crisp as listen direct from card and from computer...  No more thought is given to that...,5
"I found a tiny HDMI jack on my the Canon SX20-IS powershot and found no one had one in-stock locally and special order- I needed to take out a loan. This cable worked perfectly, no issues. Now my still camera can output full HD video/audio. Signal delivered without errors to monitor. 10 feet is a good length for getting around to the back of monitors or wall mounts.",5
the cable itself is very flimsy compared to the OEM Canon.  Seems to work ok so represents exceptional value for money.,4
Very good and normal quality. You can use it instead of originals. cheap. suitable for Canon SX40HS. I haven't more words but the site required more words so I wrote that ;),5
"Simple accessory. Made well, good price, and the length is enough to give you access to a system from a table and run it across the floor.Clean audio and video. Good purchase.",5
"This was an error,however I shall keep it for a possible use,I find that the layman's description of the plug ids are lacking",3
"I chose this one because it was the cheapest, under 4 dollars. I tested it today on my GE DV-1 video recorder and used to to connect to my LCD tv's hdmi port. THe mini hdmi end went in the camera and the large end in the TV. It worked fine. I will just leave it plugged into my HDMI port 3 all the time, so I will be able to hook up the camera to it for big screen viewing whenever needed.",5
"Very good, working just as I wanted, plugged to my T2i, this is just what I was looking for.",5
"As everyone should know, any HDMI cable should be the same besides a few minor differences in version so I bought this cheap HDMI cable rather than expensive lies at retail stores, etc. I have to say that I am very satisfied with this product. You get a long cable that you can connect your tablet to your TV and still have the tablet not too far from you. The sound and video works perfectly. I haven't tested anything HD yet like 1080p movies but I'm sure it would work.So I would recommend you buy this if you want an affordable mini-HDMI to HDMI cable that works and is long.",5
Plug n play...resolution was awesome. Cord was nice quality did not feel like it was cheap. Now i can take the camera AND CABLE anywhere and plug it in.,5
Premium Canon Mini HDMI Cable is a great fits for my Canon Camera.  It is good low prices for a long 10ft cable.  I recommend it.,5
"its awsoooooooooome , i connect it with samsung LED and the picture is craaaaazy `mashallah` , i`m very happy becouse this produce",5
"Just forgo the aftermarket cables for this. The form and fit are hit-and-miss, but the Canon cable is both durable and made so that using it doesn't block off any other ports.",5
Glad this is available and at a decent price.  So many cables are overpriced just because the seller can get more for it.,4
I bought this so I can show video clips taken with my Canon EOS Digital SLR on my flat screen TV.  Works great.,5
THIS CABLE HAS GOOD CONSTRUCTION AND WORKS WELL WITH MY CANON 7D TO WATCH MOVIES FROM THE CF CARD ON THE CAMERA TO THE PANASONIC PLASMA HDTV.A GREAT PRICE FOR QUALITY AND THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF CABLE.,5
I have a Canon Power Shot SX20IS. The mini plug of this cable fits the receptacle of the SX20IS perfectly. Great buy at a great price!,5
Premium Canon Mini HDMI cable is a very good product for the price. So far it is working very well for me,5
"This is a nice cable for a good price.  It works well with my Canon 300hs point and shoot camera, fits well and delivers a good picture.  Sent to me in nice packaging on time.",5
"Given the rip-off prices of HDMI cables these days, what a pleasant surprise to buy this very functional, fully operational cable for such a great price.  It works.  It's long.  Perfect.",5
"Great producct, great price, and very happy with it!  We used it with my wifes Canon T3i and it was nice to see the pics on our 55&#34; LCD.",5
This cable is 10 feet long and at that length I doubt you'd need anything longer.It connects to my TV well and the audio and video comes through perfectly.5-Stars!,5
This HDMI Cable works just fine.  The price is so much lower than local retail stores.  I recommend the site.,5
"I have this slot in my Canon 60D which states it is for a HDMI cable that can be hooked up to a HDTV.  It is supposed to provide a sharper picture so I thought I would get one.  Canon wants $50+ for the cable - no thanks.  On Amazon I found a cable for less than $4.00 - can you believe that?  It works great.  Sorry, Canon, but I have found the price of all your accessories way out of line.",4
Cable works looks just as any one you would find in retail store for 10 times the price don't hesitate to buy.,5
"It is not thin and light.  You can put it in your camera bag, so it is very portable.The pictures from my camera look awesome on my big tv.I am hesitant to give it 5 stars, because the first time I tried using it, it did not work.I had to pull it in and out of the camera a few time for it to actually work.",4
"This cable works well with my T3i, this best thing is that it is 10ft. long so you don't have to be right next to your tv to review your photos and video....",4
"Very easy for my father to use on his tablet. Literally, plug it in to an HDTV and it shows the image on both the tablet and the TV. As simple as that. No need to mess with any settings",5
Cost under $4.00 shipped and works just as good as HDMI 6'length I paid $25.00 at Best Buy.No complaints here. Now I have a 10' so I can connect to the TV and still reach my lazyboy.,5
What can you say about a cheap cable? It works well and doesn't break the bank. Comes with end protectors. I did not have any problems with using this to display the HD output from my camera to a large screen.,5
"The price seems to reflect the product here unfortunately. I bought this to be used during a short film production. It worked about 60% of the time. It would either drop out or give a distorted image to the monitor. Haven't tested on other monitor as we were to busy working, but this cable negatively affected my production having to wait to start rolling as we didn't have an image.I will like be returning this product. You get what you pay for.",2
Works great.  I lost the original and this one is perfect for my needs. Without it my camera is useless.,5
"These cables are good. Not top of the line. However, they do get the job done and seem to work well with my DSLR.",4
"Perfect mini HDMI and it's a real bargain! There are some HDMI cables that have a very high price range, but this one has a really low price and it works great! I am using this cable on my Canon 600D/Rebel T3i. The T3i takes 18 Mega Pixel pictures and I can now see them on my HDTV. I played back HD video on it to and there was no lag what so ever. Personally, this cable seems to do just as great as those other more expensive brand cables. I would recommend this mini HDMI if you are going to be using it for your DSLR camera. 1080P Capable!I hope this review helped you out.",5
"I ordered this cable to use with my Ainol NOVO7 Elf II.  The cable was 10' as described and produces a flicker free, clear 1080p image.  Mine has rounded edges where the connectors meet the cable.",5
"No problems running from computer to monitor, great value compared to other options and seems to be holding up just fine.",5
Cable is great...allows me to bridge TV to PC and watch the pictures taken in travel...this past year... for a low price,5
Very stable for tablet to TV....love it. Pricing is best out there. Ordering 2 more. Absolutely love this for the price and function.,5
"Ordered this little package for some real connecting,came fast enough for me to say.Hav'nt got the rest of my order to perform my hook-up yet,so being fast did'nt work for me this time(LOL)  THANKS FOR THE FAST SERVICE..........",5
"Nice, economic hdmi cable. I got it for my mom to use with her new tablet. So she can connect it to the tv if she ever wants. It works just great. Nice and long cable. I was surprised how thin the cable was, but everything works fine with connecting her asus transformer to her led and lcd tvs.",4
"This cable is pretty long at 10feet. There are gold plated connectors on either end. I'm able to control my camera with the TV remote via HDMI. So, why spend more money than you have to?",5
"Worked great, no issues. I didn't realize it was 10' wanted a 6' but that was my fault.Cant beat the price",5
"The cable works as it is described, it is thinner then some other brand cables like Belkin etc. Can't beat the price.",5
"Although the name of the item is ""Premium Canon Mini HDMI cable (10 ft)"" it's definitely not from Canon. For the price I had my doubts that it ever was, but it does work and still looks to be a quality cable. Only 3 stars as the description is misleading.",3
I bought this for my tablet that has a mini hdmi port it works's excellent with my tablet the lengthily cable helps so that you can still control your tablet and this would be good for any other mini hdmi application you desire i definitely would recommend this product,5
I already used this on my recorder. I got this at the right price. Everything here is reasonable and a person can't go wrong.,5
Arrived on time and as described.  Plugged directly from my Canon DSLR to my TV.  Pictures were clear and bright.  Great price when I combined this purchase with other cables I needed.,5
"If you have a Canon camera with a port suitable for connecting to this cable... but this NOW.  For just a few dollars, you can enjoy HD pictures and video on your HD television.  Cable is nice and long for easy use with the TV.  I would recommend to anyone.",5
"This 10' cable works great with my Canon T2i and my LCD TV.  Leaves plenty of room to reach the input on the TV and step back to enjoy the pictures.  Picture quality on my 46"" tv is amazing compared to the RCA video cord that is included with the camera.",5
"Wonderful deal on a good length cable with no adapters required. I use this frequently for previewing on large screens, works like a charm.",5
I used this to connect an older NVidia GTX460 video card in a PC with a low clearance backplate mini-HDMI port to me AV receiver on a home theater system. Cable worked perfectly with no issues!,5
"The cable arrived quickly, and is well made with Gold Connectors .  This conversion of one smaller than the other also will fit most digital devices (ie) Android Tablets, Digital Cameras, Cellphones etc",5
It seems to work ok to connect my TV with a Canon DSLR. . . . . . . .,5
"this cable made it possible to connect my tablet to my big flat screen, so i could see videos better",4
"Perfect length! Sturdy, and works as good as any other major brands out there. It's the best bang for the buck!",5
Does what it supposed to and so far no problems. Length is good too as I don't have to be right in front of the TV.,5
"All the new graphics card seem to be going to mini-HDMI or DisplayPort, I hooked this up from my PC to my 42 inch LCD HDTV and it works great, the display is fabulous! Playing games like Starcraft 2 is just awesome.",5
"I bought this for my tablet (Ainol Novo 7A) which features mini HDMI out and the ability to play really high bitrate content, and 3D bluray rips.  I liked this cable because of the small profile at the mini HDMI end and I figured the thin cable would provide less strain on the tablet's port.Cutting to the chase - I'd get flicker on certain scenes during movie playback.  Always the same scenes, at the exact same time - so it wasn't a fit issue.  But the scenes played perfectly when I switched back to my old adapter and cable.  Also - I found I wasn't able to play big (20 gig+) 3D rips, when the other cable could.So . . . for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine.  I suspect this cable will be fine for the Tegra 2 tablets (Original Transformer, Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia, etc.) since playback is generally limited to 720P.  But if you play high quality video - it could be a problem - I don't know what the actual limitation is.",3
"NOTE: This is an adapter to go from full size hdmi to mini hdmi, this is for digital cameras and other equipment with mini HDMI. This is not for cell phones and tablets that have Micro HDMI adapters like the HTC Evo, Motorolla Droid, Nexus 10, etc.Not much to say here, it works just as I expect it to work on any digital camera I've used. Plug it in and you're ready to view files on the big screen!",5
Works fine when I use it to connect my android tablet to TV. Only used it 6or7 times but happy for now.,5
"Canon wanted $70 for a similar cable, but I bought this cable for my Canon Rebel T1 digital SLR at this remarkable price.  The cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear.  The standard analog cable that was included with the Rebel is disappointing and there is a night and day difference between a digital signal and an analog signal.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.",5
"I bought this for my 7D, it good, material seems ok, bit cheap, but it works. But I think it is still a bit expensive compared to same cables from MonoPrice.The thing is that I discovered that having a converter from mini and regular HDMI and a cable works better for me.",4
"I ordered this as ""Sold by Cable Matters, Fulfilled by Amazon"" because of the Prime shipment and having received defective products from Eforcity previously. For less than five bucks for a 10' HDMI, as long as it works I'm happy. Oddly, if you go to the Cable Matters store, they have one for a few cents more with a different photo. I received one that looks a bit different from that photo and the one on this listing. The one received has very square-edged plastic around the connectors rather than the  rounded sides shown.It arrived in two days and fits my Lumix DMC-ZS15. Photos and video look great on my flat screen TV. So it does what I want, but appears a bit different from the photo.",4
I bought this exclusively to use withCanon EOS 60Dand I happy to report that this cable works flawlessly with this camera.I was initially concerned about the quality based on the price it is been offered and also was worried that the extra length (10 Ft) would be an issue when it comes to signal degradation etc; But as the cable is of good quality I did not notice any sync issues or signal degradation.Having the extra length allowed me to keep the camera close to me on the couch and view the breath taking pictures and 1080p videos that theCanon EOS 60Dis capable of.It is a nice cable very good purchase!Highly recommended! - Get one to use with any device that has a Mini HDMI interface.,5
"Tested this out to connect a MK808 Android stick to my Panasonic plasma TV.  Works fine, no problems I could tell.",5
"plugged in my tablet - works fine.I haven't tested it on my DSLRs, but I'm sure those work fine too.",5
"This HDMI cable got shipped the same day I ordered it. I was thinking it would work from my Canon SLR to my laptop to view photos after I shoot them, but it doesn't. I have a small lcd screen I use, and it works perfect...",5
I bought this for the convenience of hooking up the HDMI port on my Canon camera to my HDMI tv. The length is just enough to sit back and scroll through your pictures (back and forth) at your own speed. Plugging the memory stick into the tv works as well; but you're stuck using the TV's slide show or other program to view.,5
THIS MINI HDMI CABLE  WORKS GREAT WHEN CONNECTING IT TO MY DIGITAL CAMERA. I COULD VIEW MY PHOTOS IN HD WITH MY LARGE SCREEN HDTV.,4
I got this to connect my Canon 7D to the TV. I like the low price and the quality of picture i get on TV but the cable is a bit hard to windup for storing in the bag. I wish the rubber compound used to make the cable is a bit softer to handle.,4
"This cable has simple small ends, not overly flexible or stiff.  Great value for the dollar.You can purchase with confidence.",5
Perfect. Does what it says. Very reasonably priced. I use this cable for my Canon 5D mkII with various monitors and televisions.,5
What can I say - it works at a fraction of the price Canon wants.  I would buy again.  Prompt delivery. Useful product to review photos on HDTV.,5
"I needed a Mini-HDMI to HDMI cable to hook up my computer to my TV.  This is exactly what I needed.It works without any problems, and I've had it for awhile; and moved my PC / TV many times.  Good durability.",5
"it works great, for a canon mini type slr, detected the camera and samsung tv with no problems, great price.",5
Needed it so I can watch my recordings on the big screen instead of having to transfer the files on my computer all the time. Basically just got it to share fast and it does the job.,5
"...at the price i paid for this.  using two--one as a camera-to-computer and the other as a monitor-to-computer cord, and have had zero problems with either of them to date.",5
I needed this cable to connect my Epson project to my laptop. Works great and the price made it a no brainer purchase.,5
...you can buy this 10foot cable for such a great price? The length is great.  It allows you to sit on the couch or recliner and view your photos and videos in comfort.  I recommend this cable.,4
"Got this to connect my 550 ti to my tv, and it works perfectly. Audio and Video are both delivered fine. It's good length, too. Not sure what else you could want from a cable. I suppose it's a little loose in the 550, but I'm not sure if that's the cable or the graphics card itself.Anyhow, let me know if you have any questions, I'll try to answer them!",5
"This cable works well for connecting our camcorder directly to the TV.  It's long enough to allow me to sit a comfortable distance from the TV while using the controls on my camcorder.  The connectors on the ends are not bulky, and the cable is not unnecessarily stiff.  I can coil it up small enough to tuck into the camera bag while we're on the go.  We'll see how long it lasts, but it's working great for now.",5
A cable runs lifetime. Excellent product that is no longer wearing and giving good care never going to hurt you. Product 100 percent recommended,5
Quality of connection and video seems good with my Fujifilm F550EXR camera connected to my HDTV. 10 foot of cable really helps so I can sit comfortably in front of the TV at a little distance and manipulate the camera.,5
"What is there to say?  I needed a cable to run from the camera to my TV and this is what was needed.  It works as expected, and allows me to view my videos and pictures that are on my camera directly on my television.",5
I can find nothing wrong with this cable.  It works perfectly and has a great price.  I do not understand why the HDMI cables are so expensive at the brick and mortar stores.,5
"Works perfectly at 1080p HD and in all other Canon EOS 7d modes. Costs less than 1/4 the price of the Canon equivalent. Expensive ""high end"" cables are a scam. It would be crazy to pay more. Tip: If you have never tried displaying your HD video or stills on an HD TV through an HDMI input, you will be shocked by the magnificent quality. Absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputs.",5
"I was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer. Used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders, and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer.  Changed to a heaver-weight cable that worked fine.  I plan to try it with a canon camcorder, but I suspect it will work no better. I'll probably end up returning them.",1
"Bought this to hook up my Motorola Photon 4G to my 60 inch TV. worked like a charm. you cant beat the price too. all in all, its a good product to have if your internet is down and you want to stream HDMI from your phone/device to your TV like Netflix etc.",5
"On many cars the electric outlets turn off after a period of time when the car is turned off. So, if you want to charge from an electric outlet you need this charger. Works well and fast.",5
I like to know that when I need a device I can use it when I feel like so the need to have it ready and going made me get this at home charger for my Garmin. Now I can go and around on foot and know that where there is an outlet I can charge up again and go. SLM,5
"This appears to be a generic charger, not specifically designed for the Garmin Nuvi 1450 GPS, at least I could find no data with the charger that tied it to this GPS.  I decided no to use the charger on my GPS for fear I may damage it.  To return it would cost more in shipping than the charger is worth.",1
"This product is of sturdy construction. Works well with the Garmin, and you can't beat the low price of this vender.",5
"He used it a few weeks and it didn't work after that. He had to return it and they sent him another one. As far as I know, this one is working fine. I know initially he enjoyed using it.",5
"I use a car charger more than i use the wall charger, but the wall charger comes in handy at the house",5
I bought this AC charger for my GPS so that I could charge it in the house when I get home from a trip instead of leaving it in the car to charge.  I would recomend this to anyone.,5
"What can I say....it does the job with no problems.  Actually, since I use my Garmin a lot in my car, it keeps a charge without having to charge it at home.",5
"The price was certainly right!  However, at ANY price, the product was worthless.  The adapter size was OK and the cord was long enough... BUT the connector end was wrong.  The shape was correct, but the size of the connector was much too small and would not fit the GPS device it was intended for, even though the Amazon description was very specific that this adapter was correct for the Garmin Nuvi 1450 it was bought for.  Since the cost was nearly nil (other than a couple of bucks for shipping), I did not pursue replacement.  I am still without an AC charger.",1
"This is not a Garmin charger ,it is a MOT-V3CE .It works ,but it not as advertised .This also doesnt matter but the light is Green not Red also as advertised",1
I didn't expect this camera to  be as good as it is. Takes good pictures and videos. But I am glad that I didn't buy from Kodac: their price is pricey. I gave less than $100 and consider this money well spent.I would recommend this camera.,4
"Well it seemed to be working fine for about six hours, then it began discharging my GPS completely.  Had to charge it several hours in car to get it working again.",1
Just recieved my charger works fine ! did not understand all the negative reviews. can't beat the price. shipped on time. like HDE,5
"First of all, this product charges my Garmin 1450 very slowly. I had it plugged in using this device for 3 hours and it still was not fully charged. You may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge; it also takes this long to charge the device. The car charger will charge the 1450 fully in about 1 hour. Waste of my money.",1
these were a great addition to my gps but i wish i didn't have to buy everything seperatly but this is necessary to the gps,5
I bought the wall charger because I bring my Garmin into the house each night.  I thought it would be easier to have it charge at night for use the following day. Now I don't need to use the car charger unless the battery gets low during extended use.,5
Works as escribed. Shiiping container damaged but no harm to the charger. I use it to charge my Garminwhen I use it at home.,5
This product was ultra cheap at $3.18 however it didn't work. Apparently it is possible to spend too little. You get what you pay for! For $8.50 I purchased a plug adapter and lighter adapter that works by allowing a standard USB cord to be plugged into either. The alternate vendor's product worked well.,1
"BOTTOM LINE>DOESN'T WORK AT ALL&lt;>DOES NOT CHARGE NUVI 1450&lt;SELLER TOOK MY MONEY, CAUSE NOT WORTH RETURNING. Plug it in, turns on, turns off, no charge. Can't even work on it while plugged in.",1
"I don't use this very much, but when my Nuvi has sat in my car for a few months, I'll pull this baby out and let it charge overnight when I'm about to take a trip.  Works well with no problems so far.  A good buy!",5
"wanted a spare charger to keep at home for my gps.this one works fine and  gives convenience at a low price.i keep it plugged in at home to use there.  the other chargers are packed in a bag with the gps for when i travel.  no wondering to remember if i packed the chargers for travel or left it at home.in a pinch, should the car charger fail while traveling, i can use the other a/c charger with my inverter to keep going until i can get a replacement.the usb charger that came with the other set i bought is totally useless.  i wish it had two a/c chargers instead.  if i have a pc then i have a/c and would not need a usb charger.but this one was cheap enough that paying for a useless usb cable from that other company is not that big a deal.",5
"does exactly as it is supposed to do, it charges the gps. best to leave it plugged in over night as it takes a while to do the full charge",4
"It is designed to charge your GPS, and protect the GPS' battery. OF COURSE IT TAKES LONGER! Works fine. I love it. 'nuf said.",5
Excellent. this product is lovely and is very good for use in my new iPhones and others thing to me,4
"At a much lower cost than many cost this does the job very well if you want to do extended work with your Garmin GPS away from a car, like when I was adding all my addresses to it.",5
It has worked well with no problems. That is the short and sweet. This sentence is added  to satisfy the word count.,5
This unit works as advertised.  Not the best charger I have ever used but not the worst.  It allows me to keep my Garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip.  (Could be real useful if you use your GPS city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot.)  All in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other GPS accessories.,3
"I no longer buy any accessories for a GPS (or cell phone accessories or other tech accessories)directly from the retail shop where I've purchased these items, as Amazon offers these accessories at a much better price and the Generic versions I've purchased are excellent and reliable - in this case, a charger for my Garmin NUVI 1490T.  Very happy with my purchase.  I've had the item for over 2 years now and it still charges perfectly.  Trust Amazon's sellers on items like this.",5
The charger that came with my Garmin was no longer functioning so I was pleased to find this item.  It is worth buying.  It was packaged securely and arrived very quickly.,5
"I got this charger along with a Garmin n&uuml;vi 855. The charger does what it says it does, and charges the GPS just fine. The only problem I have isn't really with the charger, but with the GPS. When the charging through the USB port like this charger does. The GPS stays powered on in ""USB Connected Mode"" the whole time. You can't turn it off, and so the screen, back-light, and maybe the GPS antenna are running while charging. Thus, increasing the time needed to charge.",3
"Garmin Nuvi 800 series Standard Red LED Wall / AC / Home Charger is a time and Battery Saver, also, the price was right.I needed it for a phone and GPS battery charger.So far it's a work horse and worth the money, if you needed it of coarse.",5
It worked perfectly. Nothing more that I could ask from a home charger. If you need one it will do the job.,5
"It's a wall wart.  It's black.  It works.  It looks just like the ones for my pocket camera, iPod amp, cell phone... I'm going to have to start labeling these things.",5
I used it once. Worked jus' real good.Can't find it now - it's probably with the 87 other AC adaptors I have because the idiots in the electronics industries can't agree on one or two standard charger voltages and connector shapes... grrrr....,5
"The thing I liked best about this charger is that one can actually use the GPS while it is being charged.  As you probably know, when the Garmin is plugged into ones laptop via USB, it enters charge-only mode and you cannot use the device while it's being charged that way.  This unit enables one to charge the device in a hotel room without the need for a laptop and allows use in order to find an expensive Italian restaurant nearby.By the way, though the title says the LED is red, mine was actually blue (Horrors!)  That slight misrepresentation aside, I think this unit is well worth the investment.",5
"I really don't have one of these wall chargers.  I did buy the accessory kit for the Garmin 260W, and use the USB cable attached to my desk top to charge my Nuvi - for what it's worth.  Also, I might mention that the Sandisk 2GB SD card I bought for my 260w may not serve to increase ""memory"" for GPS Garmin Nuvi functions.  The SD card will hold photos and recall them to display on the Nuvi, but I don't know that it will service ""routine"" GPS functions.  If anyone has, knows, or gets information about this, I would like to hear about it.I conveyed this info so that people won't buy stuff that they really don't need, and expect it to do what it won't do.",4
It's difficult to write a specific review for this product.  It either works or it don't.  It works.  That's what I want it to do.,5
Very happy with it I bought this for my Garmin GPS it does what it should without any problems great price to,5
"Installed into my Garmin 1450 and was able to download entire map of North America. Good price, quick delivery and happy customer.",5
I uploaded All of United States and Canada via Garmin and have all the space I need for my GPS.,5
I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.,5
This is the card that is needed to fit the rest of the maps and traffic updates onto the Garmin nuvi 1450. Works great.,5
Works fine in my Garmin and for a 4GB card the price is right.  I would recommend it to a friend.,5
"I bought two of these for use with two Garmin nuvi 1450  units. In my opinion, it is unfortunate that the Garmin nuvi 1450 requires extra storage capacity to handle updates; I think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the United States and Canada. I don't know yet whether I am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and I don't know whether a bigger card is available.",4
"Very pleased with my purchase. I needed a AD card for my GPS to download updates, maps, and fun vehicles. This works great. No problems.",5
I needed this card to update my maps in my Garmin because there was not enough room on the Garmin to fit all the new maps.  This card worked fine.,5
"I have purchased many Kingston Micro Cards over time and have always found them reliable, fast and easy to handle.  I use them on my GPS, HD video camera, Samsung tablet, laptops and including my desktop.  I do not remember one failing me as they are totally reliable. That is important to me as I handle them a lot...back and forth from my laptop and my other electronic equipment for my music, my guitar recordings, lyrics....etc.  I have not hesitation to recommend them highly to others.",5
"Now I can install the full maps on the micro SD card (4 GB), and have the full 1.8 GB available on the GPS for vehicle, voices and other extras.Awesome memory. Highly recommended",5
"I have been trying to update my Garmin Nuvi 1450 with the latest maps for quite some time with no success.  I had a 2GB Micro SD card installed in the Nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update, but it would never complete the download.  On an off chance I ordered this Micro SD and it worked perfectly the first time.  I have no idea why the old card would not work, but now it doesn't matter.  For the low price and free shipping, this is a great deal.",5
The sd card is fine. But it doesn't work with the Garmin Nuvi 1450 LMT. I specifically ordered this for my GPS. But it doesn't seem to be compatible with it.,1
"Got this for my Garmin nuvi. I understand the original use of card was for portable devices. Nevertheless, it is too small and easy to lose. Now I have to lug around this slightly larger SD card to adapt it to my PC. I'll probably lose it before the next time I try to update the software on the really tiny card. Clunky design overall.",3
"I bought this for my Garmin Nuvi (can't remember the model number) with lifetime map updates, a 5 inch screen, and live traffic updates.  It works great to update the US & Canada Maps because you need about 1.6GB to update those!",5
I was having problems with my Garmin nuvi 1450.  I could not download map updates. This 4gb card solved the problem perfectly.It was easy to install and now I have updated my maps.,5
When I began updating the maps I was confronted with &#34;no memory&#34;. I didn't realize my Garmin had a place for a SD card! duh&#8230;I ordered this one because Kingston is a quality company and the price was right. Perfect. I'm all caught up on my GPS updates and assume this 4GB card will last the life of the GPS and not fill up.,5
"I was not happy that I needed a micro card for my nuvi - I get lifetime maps but nowhere to put them, lol. and the card available through garmin cost three times the price of this one!! I was happy to find this at such a great price. It arrived quickly and works great. Thanks for saving my nuvi Kingston!! :)",5
"Great little drive.  It gave me the additional space to load more maps on my Nuvi.  I also use one in my wife's camera.  Any time I use her camera, I swap out the memory card so my pictures are not on her card.  She has about 3000 pictures on her card and uses her camera with that card as a portable photo album.  This card is so inexpensive that I use one to back up her photos even though I have never had one of these cards fail.",5
I`m a musician and I record almost everyday . These tapes is an excelent way to check my self. Very clean recordings and excelent playback.Good tapes,5
"Like another reviewer here, I can verify that these tapes have too much drag in the mechanism. On my Nakamichi BX-300, they frequently stop during recording or playback. It's a tension problem, wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage; basically, it thinks the tape is stuck. Cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes. I've had no problem with other, commercially available cassettes on this deck.My advice, if you have these tapes, is to run them a bit before you record to them. Pop 'em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape, then rewind fully. Maybe a few times. With one tape, after recording one side just fine it was stopping every 3 seconds no matter where I started from on the opposite side, until I performed the above. YMMV. Recorded audio sounds fine.I would add that these are recommended in the Nakamichi owner's manual. Go figure.",2
"As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the 60's and 70's.I have used thousands of Maxell cassette tapes over the years and the quality has been superlative.The Maxell XL2 is high bias, also known as chrome, position 2, and CRo2.  They are specifically engineered for music.  If you are recording rock, jazz, or classical the quality will surpass your expectations.Maxell's reputation for tapes was solidified as far back as the 1970's when the majority of the sound crews would use Maxell at the mixing board for playback after a live performance.In order to get the best result it is imperative the tape deck you use has clean heads all the time.  Failure to keep dirt away from the internal parts will result in sub-par recordings even with first class tapes.If you are recording voice only, look for the normal bias, position 1 tapes by Maxell.Try to avoid using tapes over 100 minutes you will have less headaches with breakage.  The 110 and 120 minutes are thinner and will tear fairly often.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent""",5
For some reason couldn't find high bias cassette tapes around town. Amazon to the rescue. No problems or complaints with this product.,5
"THIS PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT J AND R.  YOU ENTER  YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS: ""PLACE YOUR ORDER"" AND THE CART GOES TO ""0"".  REAL DRAG.  i CALLED JANDR TWICE ABOUT REMOVING THIS PAGE FROM AMAZON BUT THEY SAID IT TAKES TIME.",1
"let's just get past all the bs, okay? they--as in maxell--should still be selling these. I record on them all the time and it's just so fng ridiculous that they could be discontinued, or be sold for fifty dollars. It's true, that no tape really sounds better than these, unless they were to start releasing metal tapes again, which is impossible in this market.I record lps onto these tapes, and listen to them in the car. It took me a long time to get the peaks right for recording, as in where I should average the peak decibels to record at. I eventually came to five plus, which means the bars never go above four decibels. I believe my peak levels are in line with the balance of sound, that while the directional booklet for my cassette player (a tck670 sony three-head) says record at plus three, letting it go a little bit above that but average at +3, means you're getting as much sound  without breaking your eardrums. They also say to record two decibels below the distortion point, and for me that's like 7+ on a lot of stuff[some records are louder or softer than others when it comes to decibels. For instance Prince sign O' the Times is very loud, and I record at around five+ or below, while the smiths queen is dead, the newly remastered version, is softer, and I record at a 7 recording level. Recording level is how much sound is filtered through the cassette player onto the recording medium, while the decibel count meter shows you how--scientifically that is--loud what you are recording really is].Now I'm not gonna' say it's always pretty, sometimes there's an album like let it bleed, where the lp was put together rather shoddily, and the acoustic tracks are subzero to the rockier tracks. In such cases I've tried to record each track at the peak individually, though I haven't really heard them enough yet to know if this works. I will say that listening to these on a car stereo, well, the car stereo is a lot more sensitive than floor-standers and a good sony receiver. You have to be accurate to get the best sounding tape, but the reward can be fantastic.You see, I used to listen to cds, like all through college, but then my ears started to turn negative to the extreme highs and mids. Plus, you never understand the music in your brain from a cd like you do on an lp. Basically I cannot barely stand to listen to digital unless I have extremely good speakers, and that's not often.So lps it is for me, but I wanted to hear them in my car, so began this whole trek to get the tapes to sound right. High bias is much more difficult to get right than normal bias, which if you listen through a good stereo, reveals all the definition of a rough sketch on paper. The high bias is pretty accurate, though someday I would wish to maybe improve the class of cassette player I have and see if I can't do even better? Oh well, right now I have a system and it works pretty well.And to think they're not putting cassette players into new cars anymore! I rather think the record industry would not be suffering now as it is, if it had kept true to fidelity and analogue, and most importantly vinyl, which cannot hardly be digitally downloaded without gutting the sound and a lot of work! It's what they get for years of $20 for new cds and the nightmare of sam goody. They wanted to profit by everyone buying their collections all over again, and look where it has got them! People listen to music--if at all--as a casual thing, where they never really listen and wouldn't spend a dime for the crap they do in fact hear. The labels killed their own business by choosing the cd over the lp.But at least I can find used lps for bargain prices now, eh?Or prohibitively expensive boxsets. ):",4
"I have found, through my experience, that Maxell XLII high bias cassette tapes are highly durable, long lasting, and play back very clear sound.  While high bias tapes are not the absolute best for recording from CDs (metal bias tapes are), they are a big step up from normal bias tapes.  I have used these Maxell tapes for about 15 years for everything from voice recordings, to sound effects, to music.  About 10 years ago I started getting into CD burning for some of my music needs, including burning my own original music from tapes onto CD through the computer, but I still use these Maxell tapes to this day for certain things.Cassette tapes and tape decks are becoming more and more a thing of the past.  If you still have use for them, then I highly recommend these Maxell tapes.",5
"EDIT: Turns out there are a few companies out there that still make high end cassette tapes for recording. See the link from the commenter below, and also try musicians friend. Don't buy this aged overstock overpriced junk!We who still love the warm sound that only analog provides and are still die hard, DIY recorders using analog 4tracks are forced to pay ridiculous prices for OLD overstock hi-bias tapes from the 90s since the only brand name cassettes you can buy at a store like Walgreens is a 5 pack cheapo Maxell normal bias (even these are being hard to come by). This is the case with Amazon and eBay - all I can find are overpriced overstock still sealed high bias cassettes for five bucks each plus shipping - Neither TDK nor Maxell make Hi-Bias anymore so all we have is old leftover stock and these sellers exploit that fact. I'm not sure if the cassettes lose any of their quality after a certain amount of time (please comment if someone knows), but regardless, I don't recall paying these prices when they were new!I don't know if anyone manufactures new Hi-Bias tapes... if anyone knows, please comment... Anyway, this is very discouraging. A home made tape was a labor of love and a sound you cannot get from digital. I still am a die hard analog DIY recorder, and I use an 8 channel analog Tascam 4track, one of the best models of 4 tracks made, using Shure studio mics, and I often master to a CD burner, not a PC (depending on what I'm working with). The tracks only become mp3s when I rip the master CD into the computer. It has become increasingly harder to do this because of this. Now I use my 4track mostly to record solo recordings but I have used it to record full band demos and have been able to produce near professional quality recordings! Sublime's ""Robbin' in the Hood"" was recorded entirely on an analog 4track, as have others.Doubtful, but any sellers reading this? Your 10-15 year old overstock hi-bias tapes aren't gold, jerks.",1
"Maxell manufactures excellent ""Xlii high bias"" 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. Record lectures, music, conversations, piano playing and more--whatever you want! The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.The tapes are extremely well made in that they DO allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.If you pay the current Amazon price of $13.77 for the five-pack you spend roughly $2.75 per tape. Some people will find that to be too expensive while others will want these blank cassette tapes anyway, not minding having to pay the price.Unfortunately, these tapes still cannot produce 100% the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be at least somewhat sharper and clearer with less background noise than these Maxell cassette tapes will give you. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording. I also agree with the gentleman who suggests that you clean the heads of the tape deck before using these cassette tapes to maximize the quality of the recording.Overall, Maxell Xlii high bias cassette tapes makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.",4
"I have used Maxell XLII for over two decades.  I've used them on a Nakamichi 581 cassette deck, a Tandberg TCD320 cassette deck, and small hand-held recorders from Sony (with built-in microphone).I've used the Maxell XLII tapes for recording albums from vinyl, recording from compact discs, and recording live, e.g., parties, waterfalls, and my own electric-guitar playing using a Nakamichi microphone.When I first got my Nakamichi 581, I did a side-by-side test of an actual vinyl record, and my taped copy of the vinyl recording.  I was not able to tell the difference.  This demonstrates the high quality of the Maxell XLII tape.  The particular recording was a duet with Max Roach on drums and Anthony Braxton on saxophone.  This recording was an especial challenge to the tape's ability to record at higher frequencies.  The Maxell tape passed the test, so to speak.  Also, I recently listened to recordings that I made in the year 1980.  I have no reason to believe that the recordings on my Maxell tape have deteriorated.  This is another good thing about the Maxell XLII tape.I have nothing bad to say about the 90 minute Maxell XLII tape.But I do have bad things to say about tape recorders.  First of all, my Tandberg is a risky machine.  Perhaps, one time out of 100 times that I use the Tandberg, the tape gets tangled up.  I blame this on the Tandberg, not on the tape.  Another problem is that my Nakamichi 581 has been broken for many years, and I have not been able to find anybody who repairs this sort of machine.  The Nakamichi 581 was, and probably still is, the highest quality cassette deck known to mankind.  But I can't find anybody who can fix mine.  Again, this is not the fault of the tape.Finally, Sony had an excellent little hand-held cassette player/recorder, the TCM-454VK.  The sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds and children's music concerts.  However, I dropped this Sony machine, and it broke, and it is not manufactured anymore.  Instead, Sony does make a similar, newer model, but the sound quality of this Sony cassette recorder is garbage (please see my reviews of the newer Sony machine).  But this is not the fault of the tape. Sony TCM-200DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder adds a high-pitched whining sound to your tapes.  A similar recorder, the Panasonic RQ-L31 Portable Cassette Recorder with Slide Microphone, adds a high-pitched chirping sound to your tapes.The following applies only to recording nature sounds, children's marching bands, and so on.  The following does not apply to making tape recordings from commercially available music on compact discs.Last year, I bought a digital voice recorder, the Olympus DS-40.  Please see my review of the Olympus DS-40.  The Olympus DS-40 is an absolute dream and a miracle  -- because of the very low background noise, because of the absence of clicking sounds when starting/stopping or when pausing/restarting recordings, because of the extreme length of recordability, and because of its extremely compact size.  Therefore, at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds, marching bands, and parties, cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choice.",5
"I use this in my car to play mp3's of Rock, D+B, Electronic and some Metal and it all sounds good. Convenient feature allows the cord to come out of either of 4 spots on the cassette so it can fit in any car and lets you control where the cord goes. No problems yet, it does as advertised and as always Amazon rocks with fulfillment.",5
"Yeah, yeah, so if we're looking at these cassette adapters we already know we're not on the cutting edge of the tech world.  But this is still a great way to couple audiobooks and music from my smart phone to the sound system in my ancient crate.  Works way better than any FM transmitter I've ever tried (although I admit I gave up after the first one or two).  And the quality of this Maxell unit is at least as good as anything else I've come up with the last few years, particularly for the price.  The heads look well made (I've seen others that were downright crude) and the mechanism is quiet after six months' use.  Sound quality is certainly good enough, although my car is noisy enough that it's not a big issue.  I can't discern any difference between what comes through this adapter and sound off CDs in the factory player, so it's sure good enough for me.  I'm not an audiophile, but if I was I wouldn't be messing with cassette adapters!",5
"How do audio cassettes load in your car's cassette deck? Do you insert them with the narrow side or the wide side? The problem is that most cassette adaptors can't accommodate both types of cassette decks.With this Maxell adaptor, that isn't a problem. The great thing about this cassette adaptor is that the audio cable that leads out of it can be configured to exit from the narrow or wide side meaning no compatibility issues.NOTES-----------If you're not hearing anything, try switching the audio cable to exit the cassette adaptor on the opposite side. In my Rav4, cassettes load by inserting the narrow end. But since I didn't hear any audio, I thought this adaptor was broken. It turned out that if I made the audio cable exit on the *other* narrow end of the cassette, then there was no problem.Also try increasing the output volume of your iPod.TESTED WITH :------------A 2001 RAV4 and an iPod 30 gig and also an iPod Touch. They worked fine except for the set-up issue mentioned above.",5
"I drive an old car, without a CD drive. It has a cassette drive, though and I had an additional MP3Player I did not use anymore, so I bought this gadget - and it works! Sound quality is surprisingly good, the basic volume could be a bit higher but otherwiese it produces a clear and rich sound. The only little annoyance is, that now a cable is sticking out of the cassette deck and hangs around the front panel. But eventually I will fix it somewhere, where it is not in the way anymore.",5
"The cassette, as other have said, makes a clicking noise as it runs.  I have it in a 2001 Rav4 OEM stereo.  It will also cut out when tracks change on the music player.  Very annoying.  I would not have bought this except for the Maxell name.  Disappointed.",2
"I'm actually a bit shocked. I've been using this cassette adapter for the past two years. The sound quality is good, although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes. The cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well. In cold weather, it sometimes sticks a bit. But overall, it has worked quite well. I don't leave my mp3 player in the car, so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging. It managed to last 2 years, which is excellent considering how quickly 8mm stereo cables can develop shorts.",4
Use this to play my ipod in my nissan maxima tape player. Works great and the audio is pretty good. Better then radio quality but not cd quality.,4
It works fine and is a pretty good product.  I picked this one over 4 other ones because it was cheaper and had okay reviews.  It does the job well.,4
I got this several years ago so my daughter could listen to her iPod through the family car radio which does not have an AUX input.It does not provide super fidelity but such a device can't ever be compared to a direct connection.It works good (certainly met my expectation) and it still gets used occasionally to play mp3s from my phone.,5
"I purchased this to listen to podcasts off my BlackBerry Curve 8330 (Sprint).  I have found that the sound quality varies from podcast to podcast due to the level of compression used.  Generally I turn my BlackBerry up to full volume and almost do the same in my car stereo.  The sound quality is ok - it is a cassette after all.  The cord is not very thick so you need to be careful not to snap it or pull on it roughly.  I might try another adapter to see if there is any difference in sound quality.Also, the Dolby noise reduction is a must, otherwise you will get a lot of hissing.  I would say overall the purchase was positive, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.",3
"So I just got an iPod 4GB from Amazon and was dying to play it in my ride. Unintentioanlly I saw this in a friend's car and I did some research and a week later it's in my hands. Well, I have to say this is an impressive tape adaptor. The sound quality is just as good as playing a CD and the stereo in my car reads it smoothly. On top of that, it's inexpensive!So if you are looking for a tape adapto for your iPod, you should get this one! :)",5
My other adapter was taken from my car so I needed a replacement. I am satisfied with this one. It does the job well! I'm glad I bought it. :),5
"Folks let me be honest, i ran through several loops till  i put the money on this adapter!1. i tried several in car radio wave adapters in car radio listing to my iPod video (all of them are crap!) i wasted 70bucks)2. I tried several no Brand cassette adapters (crap! i wasted like 20 bucks on no name version)I say if u are an audiophile in your car and your iPod is a must everyday, get this Maxell adapter! its the only one i found to work fantastically on a lexus GS300 and a Honda and a Merc and Toyota factory installed players.This stuff i think has improved over the years. I don't hear any hissing even during classical performances!",5
This works perfect for hooking up my phone to my old tape player in the car. The cord is probably 4 feet so plenty of room to move and it seems to be quality. Mine does make a slight clicking sound when playing but this could be caused by the car tape player and not he adapter.,4
"This works great and saved me $$$$ that a newer vehicle would have cost.  Plug it in and listen to whatever you've got on your phone or access stations through your phone.  It's fun to listen to foreign stations, etc.",4
"I ordered this after much searching.  I ordered this one to go in my Toyota Sienna 2001 which has a cassette deck. I chose this brand because I trust it more than the cheaper ones.  It plays good through my car stereo.  The sound is good enough, not as  great as when you have earphones on, but nothing will sound that good when you are in a car anyway. So far I am satisfied with it.",5
Works fine. The only Caveat is that you may need to manually switch the end where the cable comes out to match the  direction of your cassette player.  When used as configured my player rejected it until I changed the end the cable came out.  I would have preferred a product that did not require configuration.,4
"I bought this to replace my old sony tape adapter I've had since the Discman days. That one worked great until my car (Acura TL) decided to start doing the auto-reverse deal and constantly spit it out. Being the cheapo that I am, I wanted to find another tape adapter instead of getting an audio input installed in my car, and I was hopeful when I saw the reviews on this adapter. However, this product constantly clicks, and loud enough to distract me from the music playing. Also the quality on this adapter is much worse than my 15-year old sony adapter. There's a lot of white noise, and I have to crank up the volume on both my ipod and my car speakers to get it to a volume where I can actually hear the lyrics of the songs.  I've tried fiddling with the wire, moving it in different positions, and pulling the wire straight, but it doesn't help. I've rendered the adapter pretty much useless, and for now am stuck listening to the radio until I decide to suck it up and stop being cheap about installing an audio jack in my car.",1
"Has a little hum, but the highs are crystal clear. Sounds as good as cd.",5
"Works great.  It is excellent quality.  I use it for my mp3 player in my car, and the sound quality exceeds the ones I've used in the past.  I had a couple ones from Radio Shack before this one that didn't hold up for very long, and broke after a short while.  The problem area with other one is where the cord connects to the tape and on the other end of the cord where it connects to your audio player.  This Cassette Adapter uses a much more durable cord, which gives it better reliability and sound quality.  I have had no problems whatsoever with this unit and would recommend it to anyone.  I have a discerning ear for sound quality, and this exceeds all other units I've tried.UPDATE:  I lost my old one when I got a new car, and liked it so much I got another to replace the old one.  I had the old one for 2-years without any issues.",5
I use this in my older model truck to listen to my ipod. I have used different FM transmitters in the past and was never really happy with the sound quality. This is the way to go. I wish I had tried it before!,5
"I was force to buy this since the one that came with my Sony portable CD player and my cassette player in my car didn't get along! I had one of these for years but time got the best of it. SO if I have to get another one, this was my only choice since it works without ANY drama!",5
arrived on time.  Was brand new as described. I like this product because it brings out a little more bass in the sound.  This is actually the first stereo cassette adapter I've seen that has an extra bass feature.  I recommend it very highly...,5
"Works but got rid of it because of the loud mechanical sounds from the internal gears -- squeaking, grinding, crunching sounds. Much worse than my previous Maxell adapter.  Poor manufacturing! Ordered the Philips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter for which the Amazon reviews about noise are much better (and it's a buck cheaper to boot).  Indeed, the Philips was very good.  Buy it. Don't buy the Maxell. You'll be happier.UPDATE to review: about a year after purchase, the Philips is making louder and louder noises.  I guess noise is endemic to these adapters.",1
We got this player because another brand would not work in my husband's Taurus. It kept giving us an error message and he could not use it with his Ipod. This one does not have the same problems. It works every time. We are very happy.,5
LOVE these adaptors ! i got this one  mainly for my car... since it  has a  combo cd/cassette deck(which is awesome)this little  gem  does the trick...i use this to play  my mp3 players (sony and an ipod )  the audio quality is superb.. its  crystal clear..  i  also use this in the house on my stereo system...this is a great buy! and its worth it  to have a few of these on hand...you never know when youll need one.,5
"Works well, purchased as a replacement for another that just wore out over time. Sound quality is very good with no sounds or squeaks from the cassette player.",4
"I was really surprised at how good the sound quality is with this unit.  My old adapter distorted if turned up to loud at the source, but not this one.",5
"This thing works great.  Being able to move the cord around is very handy when using this in various places.  I use it in my car & home stereo & the sound quality is very close to a CD. There is not very much ""airy"" sounding feedback either. Make sure to turn the volume all the way up on the device so it will sound the best.I love being able to plug in my Android phone & stream things from the internet through my car stereo!I highly recommend this if you are considering one of these.",5
"I did a lot of investigating before buying this product. I ended up buying it mainly because it was the only one with decent reviews that I could find in stores. However, I am not disappointed at all. The sound isn't quite CD quality but it's pretty darn good and definitely better than a regular tape. I don't have an FM adapter but from what I read, the cassette adapters have a much better sound.The other big bonus is that it doesn't matter which way the larger opening is on your tape deck because this adapter has a latch you can open on the bottom to change the cord over to the other side if needed. Warning, some brand name adapters will only work in tape players facing a certain direction! Every once in a while I have to put the tape in twice for it to work right; otherwise I haven't had any other problems with this and it gives my mp3 player a great sound! Another tip: if you don't have an equalizer on your car stereo or mp3 player, what you can do is adjust the volume on the player and your stereo to balance the bass and treble (for me, if I have the mp3 player sound lower and the car stereo louder, I'll have more treble...and a little more static, too).As an aside, I doubt the product itself was the problem for the person with the bad car speakers who reviewed this product negatively.",4
"After ordering and returning the Coby brand version, which did not work at all, I am pleased to report this one works fine.  I bought it to play tunes from my Sandisk mp3 player on my car cassette deck, and this unit fits the bill nicely!",5
"I was pretty skeptical that this item would produce acceptable output through my Honda CR-V's cassette player when connected to a Sansa Fuze.  However, I was pleasantly surprised -- not only that the sound was acceptable, but it is actually quite good!  As a professional MIDI musician, I'm pretty demanding in what I consider ""good""; this Maxell adapter far exceeds what I was expecting from this type of technology.I understand that there are going to be numerous variables in play with what every consumer can expect in the way of sound quality.  Probably the largest factor is going to be the quality of the cassette deck that will be using the device, specifically, the playback heads.  The results weren't quite as impressive in one of my in-home cassette decks, though still good.Another very important factor is the quality of the MP3's being played; the better the playback device, the more readily you'll hear the shortcomings of a MP3 or other digital file.  After all, some people are happy with 128 kbps MP3's (which are pretty low quality to begin with) and none of my MP3's are less than 256 kbps ... even those I've purchased from Amazon.Overall, I'm very happy with this device and consider it a very good, inexpensive alternative to having a dedicated LINE IN/LINE OUT option like those you find on newer in-car decks.  Near CD-quality, to be sure.",4
This works great. It shouldn't be that difficult and it isn't. We used it to connect an iPod to my wife's car stereo. The sound is just fine--much better than an FM transmitter we used in the past.,5
It works. It wasn't expensive. What more can you ask for?  Only use it for the car. And so for 15 bucks it represents the cheapest way to wire my pod.,5
"I have a single CD plyer in my 2003 car.  Never cleaned the lens the entire time I own it.  Lately it's been scratching my CDs, and frequently not playing them.Put this lens cleaner in.  At first it wasn't doing anything, but the CD player just spit the CD right out.  Apparently the lens is really dirty.  After a couple times of putting the CD back in I heard instruction in track 1 saying that tract 2 only needs to be played the minimum of 20 seconds to get the lense cleaned.My player required 5 playings of full tract 2 to function properly again.When I took the lens cleaner out, I see a lot of dust on the little brush, and on the bottom surface of the disk (picked up by static?).  I think it has done its job, and now the CD player is playing my music again.",5
"This makes it easy to clean your cd player. It tells you what to do when you play it and is not liquid based. Good cleaner and for dirtier lenses, make sure you use a few times to get it good. Always good to have one of these around.",4
This arrived in only two days so I popped it in on the way to pick up the kiddos. This directions are on the disc and really simple. The cd makes an annoying beeping sounds while cleaning ( I turned the radio down and kept checking for it to finish) but that is my only dislike. The packaging was very study.  I will definitely buy from this seller again.,5
"My 2002 Pontiac Montana's CD player started acting up a few months ago. Almost every time I put a CD in, the player would spit it back out and the display would say ""CHECK CD."" After 3 or 4 tries, the player would finally accept the CD. But it sure was frustrating. So I stopped at the dealership and inquired about this problem. The first thing the service advisor suggested was to try a CD lens cleaner. I had never used one of these in my life. And I've had CD players since 1984. But when I went to my brother-in-law's house for Thanksgiving, he had just purchased this same identical CD lens cleaner at the local Meijer store. I asked him if I could try it out in my car's CD player and he gladly obliged. Well, after one cleaning, so far the CD player hasn't rejected any of my CDs. And we drove back home after Thanksgiving...almost 300 miles...and played many CDs. So, for now at least, I'm convinced. I came right home and ordered this Maxell CD lens cleaner for myself. I don't know if I'd feel comfortable enough to try it in my Mac desktop or PowerBook...but I think I'd feel safe using it in my Sony CD player or PlayStation. In fact, the PS2 will be the first device to get cleaned when this arrives. It's been rejecting discs, too. Maybe the lens is just gunked up with dust. Anyways...it fixed my car CD player trouble and saved me a lot of money that the dealership would've charged me to service the darn thing. I'd recommend it highly.",5
Did not resolve the issue with my car dvd drive.  When I put it in the drive ejected it as it did with dvds.I beleive it is ok. Just haven't tried it in any other dvd drives I have.,4
"I am unsure of the benefit of using this CD lens cleaner.  It MAY have solved the problem of a dirty/dusty lens, but it may not have, as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved.  Another CD player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only music.  Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs.  If nothing else, this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix, but if your CD player's lens needs cleaning, there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem.",2
I don't know why I purchased it. I don't even understand how its supposed to work anyway. Mawell makes cheap products anyway. Pretty sure you can find it in the dollar store.,1
"After trying the memorex lens cleaner obtained from wal mart and returning it because neither of my computers' CD/DVD drives recognized it, I bought this product [the Maxell CD-340] from Amazon. Shipping via prime was rapid and arrival was in excellent condition. The product works just fine* thus hardening my position/opinion that Maxell products are of good quality and Memorex products are of lower quality.* My computer's drive can now burn a music CD at full speed and make a product which is playable on the same drive. Before cleaning, I had to reduce writing speed from &#34;fastest&#34; to &#34;medium&#34; to burn readable disks.",5
"The product is not recommended for note book optical drives, but I used it anyways and it seemed to work.",3
"Hey, I am a music professional. I make many recordings and service equipment so I know what's going on in the world!This disc has a 1/8th&#34; by 1/8th&#34; piece of felt glued to a blank CD. I could have done that but I wanted PROFESSIONAL!Again, 1/8th&#34; x 1/8th&#34;. if you look on the internet it even tells you how to make these. Because the lens moves you need the felt to be the entire distance of the CD plus on both side for balance. However this is a tiny dot. You would have to leave it in the player for a week in order for it to clean the lens correctly. Shame On You Maxell... Shame Shame!",1
"It worked great for me, but look out the handle on it may break off as it did me. I found out that you really don't need it. The reason I gave it 5 stars is the fact it really works.",5
"I tried to use it in my 2008 Ford Explorer factory CD changer.  No luck.  It would just spit it out when it got to the brush section.I know some others had said it worked for them in their car decks and changers, but sadly, it did not work for me.If anyone has any ideas or tips that might help it work, I'm all ears.",3
"I just needed something, Any brand would have done. Worked great, helped alot and was pretty cheap. (under $10)No Cons.",5
Just as described.,5
"I've used the maxell CD-340 cleaner in my car and home players (two of them -- one a recorder where I've cleaned its mirror too) for 10 years and they've never failed. These things don't do much; you stick it in, listen to some jingoism and a pleasing voice on the first track, then advance to the cleaning track and wait for 20 seconds while a continuous beep ensures you turn the volume way down. Afterward, your lens is clean. That's all there is to it.Why does the lens have to be cleaned? I can't answer that since I've never seen one. In the cassette era, I bought a clumsy plug-in electrical wand with a metal probe that I had to physically touch to my recording and playback heads (on reel-to-reel players too) to demagnitize them. Apparently all that tape going through left some kind of magnetic charge behind that would foul the signal at some point. It's questionable whether the gadget I owned ever actually worked, unlike this product, which works every time.There's no such issue with the digital CD lens cleaner. This disk has some encoded voice commands and about a dozen little brushes the protrude about 1/8 of an inch from the surface of the disk. I guess the disk spins and the brushes rub off the bad stuff from the CD lens. If there's another explanation, I'd like to hear it. It works every time.Unfortunately, the thing this product won't do is eliminate age from cranky car CD players. I've owned a couple GM models where the player had to be replaced and the player in my 2006 Chevy Malibu is becoming increasingly wearisome. It has a habit of failing to play disks that are thicker than the norm. You'd think there would be a standard in the digital industry but there is not. Sometime spinning my maxell CD-340 arrests this behavior but typically it does not. I usually have to burn myself a homemade disk on a maxell CD-R blank disk Maxell 32x CD-R For Music - 30 Spindle to get the recalcitrant player to spin the music.As for the cleaner, it works in spades every time. Buy with confidence for that purpose.",5
"Received the shipment on-time, but the first thing I noticed when opening the box were the words ""not for laptop use"" written on the package.  There was no mention anywhere in the specs or description of this item on the site that said it was only for laptops, so since I only have a laptop, I have now needlessly purchased a product I cannot use.",1
This is one of the best Dvd cleaners . I use it to clean my Sony Dvd burner head once a week.,5
"Did the job I needed to clean all discs components, very handy and use ful to have, for all cleaning",3
"I have not use it yet, so I can not write a review for this item at this point, but I will as soon as I use it.",5
"Easy to use and cleans a CD or DVD completely. Try it and you will think it is good also. Great price, much better than buying locally.;",4
"Been having trouble with both my PC DVD drive and video recorder in getting a good clean start and/or play/record. Put this in today and followed instructions and after just 30-45 seconds, removed the cleaner disc and tried some prerecorded discs that have given me trouble in the past. No problems now!!! everything I tried out started up lickety split and played perfectly. Probably saved me from ordering a new DVD drive for the PC. Should have had one of these discs months or years ago. Highly recommended.",5
"I was having problems burning DVDs in my Macbook Pro SuperDrive.  Bought this and didn't realize it said ""not for use in laptops"" until after inserting disk and it getting ejected without being recognized by the drive.BUT...it worked!  Tried burning a DVD afterwards and it worked.  I guess it spinning in the drive trying to be recognized did the trick.How 'bout that...",4
"This CD Lens Cleaner didn't work for our broken system that could no longer read CDs.  But it has worked on systems in the past.  Simple and fast to use, you just pop it into the player like a regular CD.  There is none of the nonsense with fluids like they had in the old days.  It's a simple mechanism- it has a small brush-like device that gently cleans the laser lens.So look at it like this: this is a cheap investment to try something that might work for your broken CD/DVD player.",3
"Started having issues with my in-dash CD player after 12yrs. Kept getting read errors.Cleaned the reader and not having any additional issues. Nothing more than a little dust.Also cleaned the 6 CD system, thought it was having overheating issues.since it is still cold weather, may still have the issue, however no new problems after using the cleaning disk.",4
I was ready to purchase a new CD Player because the one I had wouldn't recognize any CD/DVD's.  I read quite a few ofthe reviews and based on price and reviews I decided on this one.  I installed this cleaner into the player and followedthe instructions and in less than a minute everything was working like new.  Great product.,5
got this to clean a dvd drive and it wokred as intended . its good and useful good buy recommened,5
"I used this product on a Philips DVD Recorder. Horrible Mistake!!! It must have screwed up the lens alignment because all discs that are now inserted into the drive come back with the message ""NO DISC"" and no playing or recording can be done. It ruined my machine!",1
"I bought this CD lens cleaner a while ago for use with my computer. It seems to work fine, and I have had no problems with it!",5
"This is one of those products where you can never be completely sure if it is doing anything. But I just finished using it for the 40th time, after which it is recommended that you buy a new one, and all the players/burners I've used it on seem to be in fine working order. Whether they would be working as well if I didn't periodically clean them is impossible to say.The disc has several small brushes on it that clean the equipment's lens. It takes about one minute. There are also some additional features which I have never used.",5
"I was having a lot of problems with my CD player skipping, refusing to play certain CDs, and randomly changing CDs. I thought I would have to replace it, which I didn't want to because it's a high-end one, and I just love the sound quality. In the process of shopping for a new player, I came across information on CD lens cleaners. People were saying that they saved their CD player. Well, it's true! Don't believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out! My 12 year-old CD player just had a dirty lens, it wasn't broken.This one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens. Some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the CD player accepted, so that was the reason I picked this one.You put the CD in the player, in my case a 5 CD changer, and hit play. It then plays a little music and talks to you! When it's done cleaning your CD player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check - basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels. I was glad to hear that mine were indeed hooked up correctly.Tonight I put in a CD that had previously skipped or gotten stuck on a part of a song. Will wonders never cease...it played perfectly!Couldn't ask for a better product. Saved me a ton of money on a new, high end (I was going to choose a Yamaha) player.",5
"Had trouble with recorder playing and then recording, used this cleaner and now works like new. Will use on a regular basis from now on.",5
How can you tell that these things are actually cleaning your DVD player?  I haven't had any problems but I'm just curious if it's actually cleaning...,3
"Easy to use, cleaned the CD player - but the CDs still skip.Ordering a CD cleaner next. Sigh...the CD's are borrowed from the libary -so maybe they are in really bad shape?  Worked for most I guess...",2
"this product was wonderful,i have cd player in my basement which quit playing cd and i used it once and thsat is all it took the lens was clean and have not had any troubles since",5
"i have my doubts as to whether these things do any good or not. never once have i had one clear up a burn problem. there is no substitute for opening the cabinet and blowing it out w/ something like a Datavac (see product on Amazon; it replaces all those cans of compressed air. one of the best investments i've ever made. i blow the dust of discs BEFORE i put them in the player. that's how most dust get's in them, on the discs!), and cleaning the lens w/ a foam tipped swab and pure alcohol.",3
Totally disappointed with this product. Purchased it after reading several positive ratings on Amazon but the disc did not work in my car. The car CD player kept on displaying werror while reading this disc.,1
"I tried this with a CD-ROM player that was not recognizing the CD. Initially it seemed to help a little bit. But the problem returned quite soon. So I tried using the cleaner again, I think three times in a row. The problem really never went away.",2
"I purchased this particular disk cleaner based on the reviews I read. It cost a little more but I know Maxell to be a good brand. The directions are not clear enough for me - they assume you already understand how the thing works. Then, I couldn't get it to work. It was supposed to go in and then start talking. Of the 4 slots I tried it in it only worked inone AND it wouldn't come out without tweezers that scratched the disk. I have a Bose player withthe extra disk player which is a very good machine. I had some minor problems with one slot and I was assured the cleaner would take care of it. I never even got the disk to work let alone clean anything. I am afraid to put it in anything for fear I won't be able to get it out again. I don't know if this was a problem with my player but some disclaimer about not working with some players should be added more clearly and should list the brands it doesn't work with.",2
"It really worked for me I noticed a difference after the first application but I actually had to run it maybe 5 times total but now no more skips! Might depend on just how dirty your lens is. Another plus is the equipment test it can also run on your system, found out my system was out of phase and I didn't know it. Just a fantastic product get it!!Tom",5
Good  headphones.  I like (very much) that they only have a wire on one side  and they are lightweight..The sound is pretty good. I enjoy using them.,4
"My job involves wearing earphones ALL THE TIME.  so if they are tight, my ears get sore and especially where my eyeglasses go behind my ears.  These are perfect with really good sound.",5
"Obviously these headphones are not for the audiophile. Nor are they for the person who expects anything they buy to last for a decade or more.These headphones are for the person who wants tolerably decent sound reproduction in a compact package. Commuters, some travelers and others with modest expectations will love these. They fold into a pretty small package that can be tucked into a somewhat large package or a fanny pack or backback or mesenger bag or what have you. The headband has a wide range of adjustment and maintains the position you set it in.The earphones are large enough to cover most ears and are comfortable for extended wear. (I've been wearing them while sitting at the computer for the laat five hours without any discomfort.)If you don't demand much in the way of bass or treble, the audio range is acceptable. As I said, these headphones are not intended for audiophiles. That said, distortion isn't a problem even with the audio cranked up.These headphones don't pretend to be noise-cancelling. They are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor. They are sturdy within a limited degree and should last for several months. Considering their price, the need to replace them from time to time is hardly a pain.Overall, a good value as long as you don't demand or expect more than the product can deliver.Jerry",5
"These headphones are perfect for the walking iPod/iPhone listener. No buds in ear, no strand ear canal. I use other headphones but these are good, like the fold in ear pads. Cord could be about 6&#34; longer, but still okay.",4
"Another good buy.  Again, very affordable, and they work.  Far less expensive than buying them in a drugstore.  I like the single wire, it seems to be much easier to manage than two of them..",4
This is a great set of headphones cheap only in price.Fidelity is fine.Design and light weight are impressive.,5
"I have several pairs of another brand for my classroom and they're pretty good. I bought this one to compare and it just feels a little cheap. Considering that I buy a pair every month or so, I'll try some other brands.",4
"I'm not a fussy headphone buyer. I like 'em simple and cheap, so long as they get the job done.Sound Quality: Well, they sound good to me. I've had some headphones sound tinny or &#34;weird&#34;, but these sound pretty normal. Mind you, I'm certainly no audiophile and I abhor &#34;bass&#34; in my music and whatnot, so take that into consideration. For basic computer usage and pop music, these sound perfectly fine.Comfort: Actually, these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. I get headaches if I wear a pair of headphones for too long, due to the pressure on my head. I also can't wear headbands for the same reason. These headphones are so lightweight and flexible that I can barely tell I'm wearing them - and so far, no headaches, even though I've worn them for some longer periods than I normally wear headphones.Overall, I'd say I'm surprisingly impressed with these headphones. I got them expecting the usual cheap headphones I buy (the brand changes, since I just buy the cheapest 'phones I can find by a brand I've actually heard of) and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of these headphones. I haven't had them for long, so I can't speak to the endurance of them, but even if they only last a short bit, I think I'd actually just replace them with these same ones. They're really that comfortable.",5
"I bought these headphones at a Tower Records about 2 years ago.  They are nice in that you can fold them and put them in a big pocket or purse and carry them to the gym.  Today I couldn't hear anything out of the right side so I'll need to toss them.  I was shopping around on Amazon and noticed the other review with the similar problem so I thought I'd add to it, seeing that it may be a common problem with this model.  I had only paid around $10-$15 in the first place.",3
really nice headset--especially for the price--i use it for my radio while i am walking--no more ear buds for me,5
"Not even me but also my friends used it for our car cassette players. Worked well, no bad comments. I am happy.",5
"I did not have any problem using it but my cassette player (in car) is still showing ""clean player"" message. It is playing the tapes as before and I cannot tell any difference in sound quality, but I should say that the quality was never that bad. I used this product because the player started showing me that message and that problem is not solved. I really don't know whether the cleaner did not do its job or simply my player is faulty (or have other issues).",3
"We bought this Maxell Audio Head Cleaner to clean our tape heads on our tape cassette player (which is now obsolete being that it was created and used by us in the dinosaur age). It performed exactly as described. It cleaned up the audio heads quite nicely...the music doesn't sound muffled or unclear. Now we can play and listen to the oldies of our time the way we used to. If you own a ""retro"" tape cassette player, then by all means, get this audio head cleaner, it'll make it as good as new. Great product, highly recommend.",5
"As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60's and 70's.Maxell 191018 Audio Tape Head Cleaner (Wet)A cassette deck can be cleaned two ways.  The Maxell 19 10 18 offers the quicker approach (It will not give you the results of the more time consuming).  The labor intensified cleaning means taking the door off the deck (For the units that allow this) and cleaning the pinch rollers and heads with specifically designed swabs and fluid.If you want faster results, Maxell has done almost all the work for us.  The cleaner looks like a standard cassette.  The instructions will specify the amount of liquid to add to the cleaning tape and the length of time to play in the deck.  Presto that is it!As always, try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.  Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent""",3
I use this in conjunction with a demagnetizing tape head cleaner cassette.  Both are the same exact thing except that this one has no rotating magnet in it.  I wet this cassette with plenty of cleaning fluid and it improves the quality of my playback after playing filthy old cassettes.  I play it with the dry demagnetizing tape to dry it off and polish it while demagnetizing it.  I recommend this tape in conjunction with a demagnetizing head cleaner cassette as well.,5
"I'm copying old cassettes to MP3s, and some of the tapes are a real mess, so after running a couple through the tape player, the player starts to sound really mushy.  A couple runs through with this tape head cleaner, and it's back to clear sound again.One thing ... I noticed another reviewer complained that they were not able to get the liquid out of the bottle because the bottle was too stiff to squeeze ... I also had this problem until I realized that you have to stick a pin inside the dropper to break the seal - after that it worked perfectly.",5
"This product arrived from High N Low Trading with a cracked cleaning fluid container, and all the fluid long gone and dried up.  It was functionally worthless, and not worth the cost to ship it back for a refund.  I might consider buying one again, but not from High N Low Trading.",1
The first of these loaded into the VCR and refused to come out. I trashed that VCR. The second one loaded into a more expensive VCR seemed to work fine (6 hrs) but after 4 uses the edge was crinkled and making noise on rewind. Again this my be my old VCR's that I no longer own as I switched to a Magnavox MDR515H DVR and no more tape plus it also burns CD's or 500 GB hard drive! (LinkMagnavox MDR515H 500GB HDD and DVD-R with Digital Tuner,3
"I use tapes over and over. Maxell has been the best so far, use to use TDK but they failed way to soon. I have a Maxell standard I've used 25 times. I tape a lot of stuff Maxell high grade is superior to thier Maxell standard,  for movies you want to save, Maxell high grade will do the job.",5
Maxell has always been a good brand of vhs tape and this did not disappoint me. I like it alot.,5
i use this brand because they last me for years. i use them weekly and they have good video and audio qualities.,5
"VHS tapes are becoming harder to come by. I normally buy Sony blank VHS tapes, but Maxell had the better deal and work just as well. I have used their products before.",5
"After I initially had some problems, the seller sent me a replacement tape free of charge via Priority Mail.  (Initial delivery was also more rapid than expected.)  The problems now appear to have been because of some programming inconsistency with one of my VCR recorders. Both tapes are now serving well.",5
"We were getting very grained tapes that we could not play back very well. After cleaning the heads with this wet cleaner, we now get a very clear play back picture. Good product.",5
"Works great!  If you still have the old VCR, this product will do a good job of cleaning it.  It is simple to use.",5
"I have used this product time and time again over the years. And when my VCR heads get dirty, and when I play my old VHS tapes, and the picture is scratchy. I clean my VCR heads with the Maxell VP-200 VHS Wet Cleaner. And after the simple yet highly efficient cleaning this product does, I rewatch the same tape, and the picture quality is as excellent as it was, if I was watching it off my my plasma TV for the first time! You are not going to find a better VCR head cleaner than the Maxell VP-200 VHS Wet Cleaner guys!. No one can go wrong with this fantastic product. Thank you Maxell!",5
Worked as described. Cleaned the heads on my vcr/dvd player and the picture quality was better. Very easy to use.,5
This cleaner works very well and is so easy to use. I will order more when this one runs out!,5
"I bought this to clean the VCR player component on a combo machine when we noticed the picture from the VCR was pretty shaky. Despite using the dry head cleaner that was on hand, we noticed no improvement. Apparently this wet cleaner was exactly what was needed. The picture shaking disappeared and did not return.Consider this a remedy for treating a dinosaur in the tech world. Glad this was still available.",4
"Who still uses VHS tapes these days?  People that haven't converted their beloved old school workout tapes by Jane Fonda to DVD.  I do not fall into this category, but, I was responsible for getting a VCR to work.  The old one was eating tapes, received a ""new"" one from a friend.  Didn't chew up tapes, but it only showed a quick 2 seconds of a tape, then everything was garbled beyond recognition.  No matter how much I played with the tracking, it did not improve.  Ran the Maxell VCR cleaner through a few times, seemed like a slight improvement.  Ignored the direction and instead of putting the fluid through the hole, applied generous amounts directly on the tape ribbon.  Put it back in the VCR, ran it a few more times, BINGO, works again.I read other reviews saying this was not the original Maxell VCR cleaner.  It seems like it is to me, but bottom line, I could care less, it worked.  I will say this though, if you want to convert precious home movies to DVD/digital from VHS, don't use an old VCR.  This improved the VCR by magnitudes, but in my opinion, it's not going to be as good as new VCR's that are made specifically for converting and compensating bad track.  Either that, or, pay one of those send-away services to do it.",5
This is a good wet cleaner. Works great and cleans the tape head so you no longer see static. Simple to use and can be used many times.,4
"I have used this product many times before, so knew just what I was getting.  It does a very good job of cleaning the track system of your VCR.  You will notice a big difference in the clarification of your tapes once you have used this product.",5
Received the Maxell VCR Head Cleaner and loved it. I have always been leary of the dry ones....I have previously had these that had a built in button you pushed to put the cleaner on the cleaning tape. They were a very professional way to go and I loved them. This is about as close as you can get to that. I mostly use my professional vcr to convert my old videos to dvd's so is nice to keep the heads clean so as to do a great job. I would recommend this to anyone...,5
"I have two VCRs that are 15 years old.  This wet system gently cleans the heads where a dry system might harm them.  Do not order the CleanDR 60128 VHS video head cleaning system just because it is cheaper than this brand.  The CleanDR shows a bottle of fluid and describes it as a wet system, but it is not.  I ordered that first and was sent a totally dry cleaning tape which I cannot safely use with my old VCRs.  So I had to return and then I ordered this brand.  I am very happy with this purchase.  The boxes (I ordered 2) I received look just like the product pictured here.",5
"Believe it or not, some of us still use VHSOnly because we are digitizing them now. Converting an analog tape to digital media takes its toll on a VCR and the heads get dirty beyond recognition. Eventually I'll have to tear down my deck to clean it properly but for now this cleaning tape really helps",3
"I tried to play some tapes I'd had stored for a long while, they were defective from age and humidity and made my VCR dirty and unusable.  This headcleaner took a few uses to clean the heads, but it got the gunk off and now the VCR works as well as when it was new.",5
"These products are hard to find anymore. While it does appear that this product does clean the heads, the one thing it does not appear to do, is rewind the tape upon completion. Do not know why it is becoming difficult to find tape head cleaning products such as this anymore considering that the DVD/VHS players are still being sold.",4
"My hubby and I bought this Wet Cleaner, due to the fact that we still have VCR's at home. Needed this cleaner to keep the heads clean after much usage. We liked it, but eventually, we will have to join the 21st Century and start getting DVR's  since it is impossible to but new (old) VCR's. It did the job, but this product can not be used all the time!",4
"This was the perfect fix for my VCR!!  I did have to run it through about three times before it was clean and functional, but worth the time and effort.  Liquid drops do come with it.",5
I used this Wet Head Cleaner and my VCR is working much better.I recommned this product to those who still use a VCR.,4
"I have a Sony VHS player that had seen very little use yet I managed to apparently ruin by carelessly slotting a home tape inside which ants had made their lair (life in the tropics!).  Debated cleaning the contaminated heads, but fearing ruining the device I ordered this wet cleaner cartridge instead.  It wiped clean the contaminated heads in one single pass and the playback is as good as new.",5
"This cleaning tape has solved the problem with two VCR's that I still use.  I don't know how the heads get dirty, but this worked well.",5
This product was as advertised and came with all of the parts. Reviewers who downgraded it must have received a different item.,5
"did the job, worked as instructions said and removed the dirt that it needed to. My player was worn out, so it did not help that problem in the tape jumping",4
"I wasn't able to find one of these in local outlets.  I have a bunch of VCR tapes I want to convert to digital, but my VHS player had given me a &#34;Clean heads&#34; message, and I had noticed more than usual static when I was playing the videos.  This cleared that problem up. ( The &#34;wet&#34; media in the package appears to be isopropyl alcohol, which I will use when the small bottle runs out.)",5
This piece of garbage destroyed my brand-new Magnavox ZV450MW8 combo player so that nothing works anymore. Amazon owes me a new recorder!!!,1
"Did the perfect job for me,, I have an old VCR, i thought was not working,, so I thought I would at least try cleaning the heads,,Most stores now a days do not sell this product anymore,, but Luckily I found it on Amazon,, and A GREAT price too,, It worked Excellent,, MY VCR is working again,, just from the cleaning tape,,,thanks",5
this cleaner works very well it is just as advertised and I would recommend this to anyone who needs a cleaner.,5
We still use our VCRs to watch older tapes and occasionally the units get dirty and project striations on the screen so that the picture is obscured.  This happens probably once a month.  A couple drops of the Maxell VCR Wet Cleaner on the cleaner unit clears up all problems.  The product does exactly what it advertises.,5
cleaned my old vcr heads pretty good.  quality of the tape playing after cleaning increased slightly enough to backup a good vcr tape to dvd,4
"I was volunteered by my wife to record her friend's home VHS tapes onto DVDs.  I have 2 VCRs, both of which I rarely use anymore.  Between her old tapes and my old VCRs the picture and particularly the sound quality was awful.  After I used the Maxwell VP200 VHS Wet Cleaner, the picture and sound improved greatly - probably the same quality as it was when the tapes were originally made about 10 years ago.Product arrived quickly, and was easy to use.5 stars.",5
"I have three VCR's - A Sony DVD and VCR Player/ Recorder, a DVD and VCR  Recorder and Player, and a third VCR player/recorder.  All take the Maxell cleaner in but after about a second of play, they stop.  Virtually no cleaning results.",1
"I have to say its a bit over priced for the fact that most dont even use VHS anymore, but I actually prefer VHS still over dvds because I dont have to worry about resurfacing when scratched so that the move will work again. My VCR had never been cleaned when i purchased it many yrs ago, found this one here on Amazon, was not happy that this was the cheapest and not cheap, but had to get it anyway. It did work though!",5
I could only see a snow screen on my VCR.  Now it's like new!!  I went with the wet cleaner since it looks like that is the best way to clean it if you have big problems.,5
"I whole-heartedly give this product my ringing endorsement. In all the years of owning VCRs, I've never really felt the need to use a head cleaner-never really had a problem.Long story made short, what I originally thought was a hardware problem turned out to be dirty heads. I was getting sound but only noise on the video. This started again shortly after purchasing a second VCR to replace one doing the same thing which replaced two previously-owned, older units doing the same thing. There had to be something else. So, after checking all my connections and cables, I purchased this head cleaner. After adding the included cleaning liquid, I ran it for about 25-30 seconds. The thing plays like new; well, it was new, but I guess all these OLD tapes are depositing a LOT of residue on the heads as I run them through.I'll definitely be using this head cleaner regularly.",5
Excellent VHS head cleaner! Been buying Maxwell products for years now and have never had any problem's or anything at all wrong with them!,5
It fits in a VCR and shuts it off. Doesn't do anything but jam the VCR and I had to power on and off just to eject this worthless thing.,1
"keeps the vhs recorder in top shape, great if you use the vcr alot. highly recomend this product. happy taping!!",5
The Maxell VP-200 VHS Wet Cleaner far exceeded my expections and I will be ordering more of them from you soon. I highly recommend this seller and this product.,5
I was and still am having thumping noise whenever we use the VCR.  This did nothing to help or fix the problem.  Years ago I used a similar product with great results for a similar problem.... is it because the VCR is old or this cleaner???,3
The head cleaner works fine.  I have no issues that I have seen from this product.  It works as advertised.,5
but VCRs are getting old and so are tapes. Can only remove so much. Good as far as it goes.,3
"Tried this in my Sony, JVC, Magnavox and Panasonic VHS VCR's and it does not work on any of them.Don't wast your money.",1
I needed my old VHS player to work to transfer videos to .MP4 files. This did the trick! Thank you.,5
"It works but it's expensive.On a side note, I was just playing with it yesterday and i happen to stick it on a hood of a canon 50 1.4 (ES-71II) and to my surprise, it fits it like a glove! It stays there and does fall off. You would think it was made for it! I just thought that was super cool.",4
Title says it all. This product is so simple and easy to use that even novice photographers should buy this.,5
"I heard others rave about the Expodisc for some time.  I thought the cost was a little high, especially since there are many other less expensive ways to set white balance (in camera settings, grey card, coffee filters...don't laugh, I did this and it was actually the next best thing to the Expodisc).  Well, I bought my Expodisc and I am a convert to the church of Expodisc.  This thing is awesome.  It gets me perfect WB every time, whether I'm using natural light, bounced flash, strobes, or a combination of all different kinds of light.  I have never once had to change the WB in post and my photos look awesome SOOC.  You can also use the Expodisc as an incedent light meter, which is pretty awesome.  I would totally buy it again.",5
"I bought the current Expodisc to replace an earlier model recently stolen. The old model seemed overpriced, but it was hand-made in a low volume production. Current models made by new owners are priced about 170% more than the old, for which you get a fancy box and a few instructions on a CD rather than on a peice of paper - big deal. However, the new models have a lens mounting arrangement which is much superior to the prior model and much more expensive to make. As to function, nothing really replaces an Expodisc if you need one for white balancing a color photo exposure. I use mine to shoot ""grey"" color negatives to automate traditional color printing. I have no experience as to whether they provide superior white balancing in digital systems as claimed, but logically they should do so. Unless you plan to be very exacting about color reproduction in your color printing, the excessive cost of an Expodisc versus the marginal benefit seems questionable. If you Photoshop your pictures to death, you will get no value from this item.",5
"Works just like it should. Serves as a great way to get proper white balance. Just place in front of lens, depress shutter button to focus and light meter, then remove and shoot. Images look much better now.",4
"[Update 8/19/08: it's over a year since I wrote the original review - radio looks almost new, cleans easily, works great, and still doesn't require frequent battery changes - still love it!]10. You've lost faith that there is such a thing as a good shower radio9. It would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good rock while gettin' clean8. It would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good NPR Morning Edition while getting clean7. It would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some the morning TV news while gettin' clean6. All of the above also applies to shaving or putting on makeup5. Tend to dawdle?  It has a timer.  Get out the door before the rest of the nuts get on the road4. It doesn't mind getting wet along with you3. Batteries have lasted me a month so far. Though I don't care. The sound is so good for a shower radio I'd happily replace them weekly2. Oh, the weather channel - very nice, although a bit repetitiveAnd the top reason you should buy this radio is:1. Ahhh, nine are enough. Just buy the thing.",5
"I have used this radio for over a year, almost every morning for 30 minutes, and I have only replaced the batteries once.  Great sound, easy to use.  It is a Sony, what else do I say?",5
"Surprisingly long battery life. After doing the research, this Sony was the one to buy, and it didn't disappoint.",5
,5
I've had this radio for months now and really like it. I like the digital tuning and timer function. The battery life is great. I am thinking of buying another one.,5
"I owned a Sharper Image shower radio (the kind with suction cups that sticks to the shower wall) for years until it died on me, and thought the poor sound quality is the price you pay for a waterproof radio.  I'm so sorry I didn't buy the Sony sooner!  The sound quality is tremendous.  It isn't waterproof but I keep it on a shelf in the shower and it withstands regular spraying with water with no problem.  I love the big preset selection (including local TV channels), the easy to use buttons and the timer that turns it off on its own.  Great machine.",5
"I agree that this is the best shower radio. I have been through (3) other radios, all bad. This unit is true 100% digitial, great reception, good sound quality, and easy to use.",5
"it's one of the better shower radios for sure, but it still sounds like a shower radio.",4
"PROS: Good audio, easy to program, good features.CONS:However, the FCC will require broadcasters to switch to a digital format in February 2009.  At that time, the radio WILL NO LONGERr receive televison broadcast audio.  Therefore, a good percentage of the radio's value is gone!Nationwide, the FCC has reserved 10 weather channel frequencies available.  Usually all 10 can't be received.  This radio only has 5 channels for weather.  In my case, none of those 5 channels contains any weather signals.",3
"Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  She's had it for a little over a year now, and it is working great.  I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality shower radio.  She keeps it outside the shower to help keep any water from ruining it.",5
"I recently purchased my second Sony ICF-S79V to replace the first one I purchased almost seven years ago!  That's right...  my first Sony ICF-S79V lasted almost seven years which is why I had no problem replacing it with the same model.  The reason why I had to replace the radio is because the plastic lining that covers the buttons on the top of the radio started to crack and water was entering into the radio causing it to not work from time to time.  The second reason is because after seven years it started to get discolored due to the humid / wet conditons.  I would totally recommend this product because it looks great, last a long time, gets great reception, a huge amount of digital presets and much more!",5
"I looked at several brands of AM FM TV Weather radios for use during severe weather when power might be out. I was searching for specific features:1. Battery power (for power outages)2. TV band (tornado tracking is sophisticated enough to get down to street-level tracking on TV. NWS hasn't caught up yet)3. Decent sound qualityThis radio met all my needs with the added bonus of being water-resistant. (I must admit I am baffled by the term as EVERYTHING is water-resistant to one degree or another.)Reception is good in all areas of my home (including those areas where we cower when tornados are lurking). The radio includes a wire antenna for FM reception which stows in the battery compartment.Sony recommends leaving the three &quot;C&quot; cells in the radio and changing them every year. This maintains the time and radio presets.Pros:  Good reception, solid design, handy controls, good sound.Cons:  Bigger than some.To avoid finding the radio with dead batteries (or worse, corrosion in the battery compartment), I set reminders in my Palm to change various batteries annually.",4
"I've bought Sony shower radios for 20 years - this is the third (and by far the best) model, and I've had at least one of all three models.  The digital tuning is essential - you never have to worry about finding or keeping your station.  I love the presets, and listening to 60 Minutes and similar TV shows is great.  The solid base means it's less likely to fall over, or off of things.  The radio is pretty tough - I've dropped it and had nothing happen, but once the AM antenna broke and that was that for talk radio.  And the batteries really do seem to last forever!  On the one I have now (five years old), the plastic waterproof top is cracking, and the FM antenna caught on something and pulled loose.  So, I'm buying another.  Don't EVER stop making this radio, Sony!",5
"I've had this radio for over 3 years now and the only problem is with the FM tuner (it died in less than one year).  It still works with AM, weather, and TV.  Since I use it for primarily AM, it's not a big deal.  Speaking of AM, this has absolutely the best AM reception of any radio I've had.One last comment: the batteries last quite a while.  I use it at least 20 - 30 mintues a day and have only replaced the batteries once in three years.If you're looking for a shower radio, this is it!",5
"No need in me going thru all of the features... you can see them in the product description.A few things that are important though before you purchase a radio for your bathroom.1. Make sure it has a digital tuner. You want to know you are on the right station and you don't want it to drift.2. Get one that has a large battery capacity.3. Ensure it has a power-off timer. You don't want to have to remember to shut it off when you leave the room.As far as reception - mine picks up great! (even without the antenna extension)This unit has all of these features, plus many more. I think you will be very pleased if you purchase this unit - I know I am!!",5
"I have had this shower radio for several months.  I purchased a similar model for my parents several years ago.  I liked is so much, that I finally decided to purchase one for myself.  Not only can this shower radio withstand exposure to water, but the quality of the sound and reception is excellent for its size.  It is very intuitive to use.",5
"I'm on my second one - had my first one for a year before my sister swiped it and took it back to Alabama with her. I guess she must have liked it a lot too. After about a week without it I had to buy another.  I do not use it in the shower but I do keep it in the bathroom on top of the toilet tank.  Wow is it great.  One push on top and the radio is on. You don't even need to have your glasses on because the button is big.  Push another button and you set a timer for it to go off after 15 or 30 minutes so you don't have to remember to go back in and turn it off. I'm listening to the morning news while I brush my teeth and dry my hair and put makeup on, and I can put it on a classical music station for a soak in the tub after work.  It's not too big, the controls are simple and intuitive, and it looks nice. The battery lasted in the first one for the whole year before my sister took it - it's probably still running at her house on the same battery. I looked at a lot of radios before I found this one - I wanted waterproof, not too big, no cord - there just isn't anything close. Highly recommended if you'd like a radio in the bathroom.",5
Picked this one up based on the reviews of this site.  Absolutely worth it.  Great sound and ease of use.,5
"I've always listened to news radio in the mornings and I like to take long showers. This is absolutely the way to go if you want to listen to radio in the shower. I've had it for over 2 years now and it has been through just 5 batteries. It comes with a bundled antennae which you can stick to the shower's wall and reception is amazing. Buttons are easy to operate and it can even tune into local TV stations so you get the audio. Sometimes I do have to crank up the volume to hear over the shower noise, but I never go more than half way up. This shower radio is excellent, get it now.",5
"I purchased this radio from Amazon in May of 2003. It's now January 2005 and the radio is still on the first set of batteries. I use it at least a 1/2 hour a day and on weekends as much as 3-4 hours per day. Fantastic. It shows no sign of wear even though it has spent hundreds of hours in the shower, and has even been in light rain beside our spa.It gets great reception (no TV signals in our town), is easy to use, and sounds great.I highly recommend this radio.UPDATE Oct 28, 2010After 7 1/2 years of daily use my Sony shower radio finally quit. As many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked, water got into the Off button area and the radio would no longer work. However I just ordered another one.This radio has some very good qualities.Pros:1) Clear and loud sound2) Battery life is so long it is ridiculous. I don't think I used more than three sets of batteries in 7 years, and I use the radio every day.3) Good reception.4) Ease of use. I really appreciate an AM/FM radio with station presets.5) It is waterproof enough that I take it in the shower every day. I don't leave it there though because I use it on the bathroom counter while I shave too. Perhaps mine lasted longer than many others because it isn't in the damp shower area 24/7.6) I like the top buttons. They are easy to hit with one hand. If the buttons were on the side or front it might require two hands. My radio is never mounted high so I don't have the issue others complain about where they can't see the buttons. Even if I did have it high it is easy to feel where the buttons are as they all have a raised bump.Cons:1) $49 is a very high price to pay for an AM/FM radio.2) It does seem Sony could do some research and improve the plastic top so it would last longer.I was pleased to see this radio is still available for sale. I looked at a few others but nothing matched, in my opinion, this one.",5
"The Sony ICF-S79V is a another good example of the old phrase ""you get what you pay for"". At $50 I was hesitant to purchase this radio but I'm delighted I did, it is worth every cent.1. Battery life is simply amazing, I listen to it for a minimum of 1-2 hours each and every day and I'm still on the first set of batteries after 5 months, I've even accidentally left it on for the entire day several times. Wow!2. Excellent reception for all bands; Am, Fm, Tv, and Weather.3. Simple, convenient buttons and operation. The o4. Peace of mind with water resistance, I've not placed it in the shower but do have it in the bathroom which often gets quite steamy.5. Excellent sound for the type of radio it is, clear and loud.6. Small footprint takes up little space.7. Like the wire antenna, didn't think I would at first. It is better than a hard antenna sticking up waiting to be bumped and/or broken.8. Timer and auto-off timer are quite nice also, even though I sometimes forget to use the auto-off timer.9. Digital tuning and display makes it simple to find the station you are looking for.10. The fit and finish is outstanding, the radio looks and feels very well constructed.Overall a worthy purchase.",5
This is a nice little radio.  It has good sound quality & it's easy to tune and to set up the clock and the station presets.  The timer function is useful since it does run on batteries.  My only issue is that I wish an AC adapter was included so that I didn't always have to run it on batteries.,5
"By far the best waterproof multi-band radio on the market.  I am purchasing my second radio only because after nearly several years of abuse from twin teenagers, it finally is starting to wear out.  I will not be without one in my bathroom.",5
"This is a classic little gizmo. We've used one since the late '90s and, even though the OFF button has long since worn through, it still works like a charm.I've purchased others as gifts for bewildered friends and once they've spent a little time with it they love it.Target and other stores have stopped selling them as off-the-shelf retail, but I hope SONY continues to make this little C-battery shower radio and doesn't screw it up with any ""improvements.""",5
"I have had one of these for about ten years and love it.  It lives in my shower.  The plastic on top has cracked over the years but it works fine.  i use it to listen to the local tv station news in the morning.  i just bought two more for my kids.***** Note- Since TV has gone digital, I can no longer catch the TV station in the morning.",5
"This radio has been good - I have owned several Sony shower-type radios, and this unit's quality is among the best.  Very good sound, built very solidly, controls are easy to use and understand.  My only wish is that they had better mounting options - I have it hanging from a shower mirror now, there has got to be a better way to mount a radio, with a holster-type bracket or something...",4
"Great reception, easy to use and good sound for a one speaker radio.",5
I have tried several waterproof radios and these Sony's are the only ones that work well. If the volume went a little louder I would have given it 5 stars.,4
The sound quality is pretty good and the radio reception is very good.  Previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas.  I especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations.  Even though the screen fogs the LCD is still readbale.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the price is a bit high for a shower radio.,4
"A wonderful product. Well-built. Very clear reception. Easy set-up. The flat, broad bottom is a great feature as it prevents tipping it over when it is placed on a surface such as a sink.Be aware that the TV channel reception feature will cease in 2009 when all transmission goes digital. Until then, enjoy it!",5
"Now I don't have to miss ten or fifteen minutes of my favorite morning talk shows while I get ready for work.  I've got this little jewel sitting on the toilet tank where it can project sound into the entire bathroom!I love having the waterproof controls on the top and the station presets.  This radio also has very good reception, bringing in one of the weaker stations I like loud and clear.My one complaint is that it has two very little rubber pads on the bottom.  That means the designers thought of slide resistance (like when the radio sits on something made of porcelan) but they didn't do enough to prevent it.  This radio needs big high-traction rubber pads on the bottom, and then it would be perfect.",5
"When home, I have the radio on a lot of the day, mainly talk radio.  I bought 2 of this radio in August 2000 (yes, three zeros) and they bit the dust in late 2007.  I got about 7 years of EXCELLENT performance from these radios.  I have 2 because one sits on bathroom sink and goes back & forth from bedroom to bathroom while getting dressed.  The other goes between kitchen and office constantly.  There's 5 presets for AM.  I wish there were more.  There's 10 presets for FM.  One used to be for Howard until he left (a huge Howard fan here who has not gone Sirius) and now I basically only use one for WCBS-FM (when they got smart and realized, in the immortal words of NY Daily News, that they didn't know jack), and the others go unused.  The TV channel part of this radio, I never use and couldn't comment.The radio is excellent.  The controls are responsive, the battery life is very decent, and most importantly, the reception is excellent.The reason my radios now need to be replaced (I just ordered one from Amazon and will try the Sangean for the second) is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic.  After 7 years of pressing the on/off button I'm sure thousands of times, the plastic over the on/off button ate through.  The on/off button needs that plastic over it to work!!  The damn thing won't turn on/off now!!  I tried turning the volume down to zero to ""turn it off"" but the batteries do wear out and it's annoying.So I figure that 7 years of constant usage is pretty good and I am not complaining and have even come back for more!In spite of the 7-year life, I still give this radio the highest rating.  Fair is fair, right?  Can't complain about 7 years of perfect performance, can we?  I say no.",5
"This is without a double the 'best' shower radio I have ever owned.  The reception is crisp and clear and I love the pre-programmable stations.  It is also a very attractive radio and so when not in the shower with me, it looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter.  It's very user friendly; no complicated directions.  Perfect for us 50+ technically challenged.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.",5
"The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is because it isn't very loud.  I honestly didn't expect it to be, especially with a single speaker.Everything else works as advertised.  I can get TV/AM/FM/Weather stations well.  The old Curtis shower radio I had was very spotty.  Digital tuning is awesome.  The old one was analog and a real pain to lock on to stations that had a great signal.  The presets work wonderfully, and the timer feature was an added bonus.Only time will tell if it lasts though.  The Curtis died after a year and a half.  If the Sony lasts that long I will be more than happy.",4
"Notice this unit was introduced two and a half years ago and still going strong which indicates to me people really like it and it holds up well.  I've had mine about six months.  It's got everything a radio should have and nothing it doesn't need, except maybe the digital clock.  The knob on the right top is volume.  The rest of the controls are push buttons on the top that include five presets for each of three bands.  The buttons are under a protective rubber cover so no need to worry about humidity or splashes.  It has an 18"" antenna with a little suction cup at the end so you can hook it on a mirror.  And it has a loop of twine on the back for carrying it around or for hanging it on a coat hook or something similar.I find its clunkiness sort of endearing.  The sound quality is all you could ask for, and the reception is excellent.  So for what it is, it's probably as good as it gets.",5
"I purchased this for my dad who uses it in a basement sauna.  The radio sounds nice and is easy to use, but does need to be positioned a bit for good reception.  He is very happy with the radio.",4
"After researching shower radios and looking at ones that cost almost twice as much, I decided on the Sony ICF-S79V and I am impressed with the following points:1. Great fit and finish.2. Not too big. Seems smaller out of the box than photos on Internet suggest. This is good for cluttered showers.3. Easy-to-use controls for clock, tuning and presets. I didn't even need to consult the manual.4. Excellent sensitivity for AM (internal ferrite antenna) and FM (a pull-out wire from the battery compartment).5. Full sound to overcome shower noise.6. Sony's decision to require 3 C batteries insures long-lasting life between battery changes.So far I have not found any weaknesses with the radio. Sony has found a niche in their shower radio. I give it the fullest recommendation, especially for the 45-dollar price (and free shipping no less) I found on Amazon.",5
"Update: I've had the unit now for about two years. It still works fine, although the material covering the on/off button has worn completely off. Actually, it started wearing off after less than a year. In light of the fact that this is designed to be a ""shower radio,"" this is really an inexcusable flaw: after all, you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio. Fortunately, I never used the radio in the shower itself. But, still, I'd have to take at least one star, even two stars off, for this defect (which I know other reviewers have commented on as well).The radio was a little smaller than I expected, but that's good. It takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive. The reception is generally very good, although I tend to listen to only one station (89.3 KPCC). Still, I had trouble getting good reception with my last radio (an Aiwa), so the Sony is a big improvement. Occassionally, I still get a little static (depending on where I am standing in relation to the radio), but overall I would give it a score of 4.5/5.0 in terms of reception (I still occassionally get some static). I also tested all of the TV stations, and the Sony had no problem tuning them all in. No static to speak of, although the volume was low. I would definitely recommend this radio.The sound quality is quite good for a radio as small as this. I have to crank it fairly high to hear when I'm taking a shower (even though it's waterproof, I don't put in the shower with me). However, there's not distortion at high volume.I cannot say anything about the battery life yet, but overall I'm very satisfied with the radio.",4
"Edit:  Well it has been over 7 years since I purchased and reviewed this shower radio and it finally bit the dust.  Radio still works (though lately I need to move it around a bit for best reception)and the clock is still really hard to see.  It is the volume button that is kaput. I can only get very loud and painfully loud.  Husband tried to fix it but couldn't do it.  Seven years is pretty good, I guess. I don't see anything better on Amazon, at least for this price, so I will probably purchase another of the same.  Something I did not mention in my original review:  the batteries seem to last forever.  Same number of stars for the same reasons.Original Review: This shower radio is attractive, compact and has great sound and station range. It is a 5 for the radio and a 1 for the clock. Unfortunately, the clock is very small and hard to read.  I purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink, but could not read the digital clock from there.  If the radio is placed too high or too low, the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame.  There is no back light which adds to the difficulty.  I had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where I stand and I still have to bend down slightly to check the time. If having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you, this Sony is for you.  If you really need a clock in the bathroom, this is not the one for you.",3
This radio is nice with digital display and nice membrain push buttons. the battery capacity is good.. lasts a long time.. the thing that is disapointing is that you can not recieve any weather stations even though other radios in the area do!! also the am reception is no better than the 20 year old radio I replaced..,4
"The radio seems good at first but they don't hold up to long-term use in the shower. I've had two of these which have died after several months of use, and am trying a different brand instead.",2
"I selected this radio for myself several years ago and I have found that all claims for it are true.  It has excellent reception, clear sound, and the batteries last forever.I don't use mine in the shower itself, but sitting on the cabinet. Volume is very good.My recent purchase was a gift; there was no other shower radio that seemed to work as well. They were cheaper, but if they don't work, what have you gained?",5
"Sony does it again.  They have put together a great radio for the bathroom.  It is easy to set up the time, presets, etc.  The sound and reception are great.  The controls are on top and protected.  The display could be brighter and I wish it had a way to hang it on the wall when not in use (it comes with a cord for hanging in the shower), but it is compact and does not take up too much space on the counter and it looks nice.  I haven't actually put it in the shower since I can hear it just fine from the counter.",4
"If your looking for a radio for your shower, then look no further.  This gets great reception and the timer to shutoff feature is very handy.",5
"This product gets used 20-40 minutes per day on average. I also use it around the house as a portable radio so it gets 1-3 hrs of use maybe once every other week.  They say the battery life is 80 hrs, but that must be if you use it 80 straight hours.  We received the radio in early March, put in 3 batteries, and they are still going strong (it is now December).  Amazing.  Sometimes I am shocked when I find a consumer electronic product that works well, works simply, and works reliably.  This is one of those products.",5
Reception is outstanding.  Easy to set up stations.  Timed on/off is automatic. Easy to read display. Great sound for a mono speaker.  Battery life is amazing.  Worth the price.  I would happily repeat the purchase if I manage to wreck this radio.Update:  The TV function of this radio is not functional with the digital TV change over.,5
"Very easy to use basic functions. Good tone, sufficient volume. Don't know what I would change, if I could. Well done.",5
"Worked well, but after about one year it died.  I'm guessing water got into it.  My daughter used it in her shower, and I'm thinking she allowed it to be directly exposed to the shower.",2
"I was given this shower radio 13 years ago as a gift.  I have listened to NPR in the shower almost every day since then, and it has lasted and performed well.  Finally the plastic cover over some of the buttons on top started to crack and break off, so I just bought a new one.  It lasts many months (6 months?) on 3 'C' batteries. The reception is pretty good.  I was hoping that Sony would have made it a bit more modern in appearance, but it looks decent enough for a shower radio.  I like the countdown timer, as I can turn it on for 30 minutes when I take a shower, and by the time I am done dressing it shuts off automatically.  Thus, I don't have to get back in the shower (wet floor) to turn it off.",5
"I have to say, this radio works flawless in my shower.  I've had it for a little over 3 months and I listen to it daily for about 15 minutes at a time and I still have yet to change the batteries on it (2 AA I believe).  Prior to this shower radio I had a Brookstone am/fm shower radio which took 4 C batteries and I would have to change them about once a month.  I get great reception of my FM stations and I even get some TV audio through it, to listen to the Football games.  It's very small and sits nicely on my pedastel and comes with a suction cup antenna.  All in all, I strongly recommend this shower radio over any other on the market.  No problems, no complaints....",5
"We've had ours for a year, use it daily (in the shower and all over the house), and it still looks and works like new. We may have replaced the batteries once. Maybe not, I can't remember.Keep in mind that it's not designed or sold as a hi-fi radio. It's not stereo, and the speaker is not large enough to provide a wide frequency response. But for its size and shape, it's as loud and clear as it can possibly be.You will never find a better radio for use in the shower: the reception is outstanding. The speaker is clear and loud enough to hear in the shower. The case is attractive and tough. The controls are easy to operate, even with wet hands. How often do you buy a product that's reasonably affordable and absolutely flawless?Update 11/7/08: My wife still won't just leave this radio in the shower, to my occasional chagrin. She carries it around the house to listen to NPR while she works on stuff and I can never find it when I want it. Today she dropped it on our hardwood floor. The battery door popped off, and and the batteries spilled out. She put them back in and NPR was again heard from the radio. Why haven't you bought one of these yet?Update 8/31/2010: Still going strong. This radio is no longer available, but theICFS79Wseems to be an able replacement. What a workhorse this radio has been!",5
"I've been using these for over a year now.  Basically, in a quiet environment these sound pretty good.  They aren't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets, but you're paying for the noise cancelling.  The raw capability is pretty decent, and has acceptable detail in treble, vocal, and bass ranges.The noise cancelling works pretty well.  I've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids.  They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices, which is nice in the office.However, I must have pretty big ears, and I've found that the foam cups aren't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear.  After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.The cord is plenty long, and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control.  An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.They're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in.  I'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me, since the MDR-NC20's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets.  I haven't had any spills yet, but active travellers may wish to find a case that's more rigid.All in all, I'm pretty happy with these.  The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price... I couldn't justify the $300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups.",4
"I will admit that I recently gave up my Sony Headphones for the Bang and Olufsen A8's ----- however, that was more for portabilities sake, than soundwith regards to sound, this is the BEST pair of headphones that I have usedThe noise cancelling features are excellent! -- putting these things on, along with the noise cancellers, allows you to hear sounds that you never knew existed within many of your favorite songsI compared these headphones, head to head, on an airplane, against the Bose Quiet Comfort 2, and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently, and equally, within the airplane environment ---- however, the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDon't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort ---- grab a pair of these and you'll fall in love quick!",5
"I bought these thinking they were the ticket to noise-free, pleasant air travel.  They fall short for two reasons.  The first is that they just don't cancel that much noise.  If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit.  To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal.  The second problem is that they generate noise of their own.  If it's not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz.  So I'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs, or a set of headphones with a better seal.",3
"I've owned these for years. I used to fly two round trips a week, and I wore these constantly, whether or not there was any reason to (in flight entertainment, a CD player).The first benefit is that the noise reduction made speech more audible. I could hear the person in the next seat better, and, in fact, I found that I could eavesdrop on people a row or two away, since the noise that would normally have masked their conversation was masked, but the speech came through.The loud, constant background sound in airplanes is very draining. I was more likely to be able to nap with these on, and I was more likely to be able to concentrate on reading with less background noise.Don't get a unit that simply insulates the sound - you might as well use earplugs or sealing earbuds. There is nothing wrong with that solution, it is just that the solution of generated countersound (exactly out of phase, exactly the right amount and frequency for the sound that is incoming), especially when the countersound is based on microphones that are right at the earphones - as far as I am concerned, nothing works as well.Microphones that are placed in an off-headphone device can't tell where the headphones are direction, or what in the environment might be changing the sound at the headphones. This effect is not as important at low frequencies, but it becomes more important at higher frequencies, so this unit can provide more coverage. The design is simply the best possible - microphones as close to the ear as possible is a huge design benefit.Well, being in a quiet environment works better, but that is not always available.When you are flying, especially if you fly a lot, small incremental increases in comfort really are worth it. These cost me less than a quarter per flight, have lasted years and are still going strong.Sound quality was fine. I could head spoken voice programming just fine, and, far as I was concerned, music was enjoyable. Airline provided programming was much better than the provided headphones.",5
"I have used the headphones for 2 years -- they offer a material reduction in the ""droning"" noise on airplanes.Even when I am ready to sleep and I turn my music off, I leave the headphones on and it reduces the ambient noise.I think you arrive much less fatigued.",5
I own these and the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 ($250.00) and I can honestly tell you the Bose phones are NOT impressively better and certainly not worth $250.00.,5
"I have owned these for over two years and wore them about 30 times, mostly on plane rides.I have a relatively small head, so I keep them at the first expansion level.  Even so, there is a lot of pressure.  After about an hour they start to hurt my ears.  I have tried to ""stretch"" them, but they always return to the same size.  I also put extra foam padding in the ear cups, which helped a little.They still have good sound quality, and cut noise- although they are not as effective as when I first bought them.I tried the new Bose.  They fit better and they do a much better job of eliminating noise, but of course they are much more expensive.",3
"VHS-C is out of date these days, but these are just as good a quality as they were when they were the main format. Recorded a few things with my old camcorder, no issues.",5
A very good product.,5
"These tapes worked nicely in my old JVC camcorder. They did make a bit of noise when recording and playing back, though. For some reason other tapes didn't do this. But it was a very faint sound, and I am happy.",4
I cannot find thm anywhere else!!  You all have a good price for them too. I wonder if I may order more? But first I'd like to find the ones I needed!! You sent them to the Wrong place!,1
havent had chance to use the tapes in camcorder yet. I bet i will use this year welll i hope,5
I recommend this products but today may Concorde not use more but it is good  when I have 6 years ago,4
I have only used it one time and so far I am quite satisfied. Will order again in the future.,5
"worked just as i needed,, I know its old style ,,but hey this works for me and my older video camera",4
this tapes came out o.k just like i expected for my camcorder real nice colors and easy to deal with.,5
"These are great tapes and are getting harder to find,I love my old camera and these tapes keep it working for me.",5
These tpes fit perfectly and have been very reliabl eon my video shoots. I will be purchasing more in the future.,5
"She loves these!  Although Prime is no longer a 2 day process, she still received it in soon enough to take more recordings of her grandchildren.",5
"These Maxell 8 mm camcorder tapes are a pretty good product.  I bought these years ago when I needed to borrow my brother's camcorder that requires 8 mm tapes.  Nowadays, they're getting harder and harder to find, as everything now is digital/hard disk.  The picture and sound quality on these tapes isn't quite as good as the more expensive 8 mm metal tapes, but it's decent enough to do an adequate job of capturing your moments.  I swear, the picture and sound quality on the 8 mm camcorders and 8 mm metal tapes is sometimes better than some of the top-of-the-line hard disk camcorders.  I have a hard disk camcorder, but sometimes I wish I had an 8 mm camcorder.I recommend these Maxell 8 mm tapes, but I would try to get the metal kind if you want REALLY good picture and sound quality.",4
"It works for me. That's all it has to do. It was and still is, an interesting idea who's time came and is still with us.",5
"I've had my Palm IIIx for over a year now, but I'm going to have to get another, because I dropped it. The Palm didn't fall far -- 3 feet or so -- but it is now useless. White lines cover the display, and the digitizer no  longer works reliably. I have tried opening up the case and re-seating the  circuit boards, which fixed most of the problems, but the digitizer is  permanently inaccurate. Even with re-calibration of the digitizer using  preferences, the location the Palm thinks I'm hitting with the stylus is  wrong, and this makes using the Palm impossible.I bought the slimline  leather case, but this clearly failed to protect the Palm in any way. Also,  the velcro has now come unstuck, so my Palm won't stay in the case.This  is a real shame, as my Palm IIIx is indispensable. I bought Intellisync  software to syncrhonize it to the calendaring software I have on my PC, and  I use it every day to navigate my schedule. Combined with the address book  for names and phone numbers, I have one place to work out what I'm supposed  to be doing and whom I'm doing it with.I don't use the other  applications much. I tried out the e-mail application, but it is way too  simplistic. I get over 200 e-mails a day, and I really need e-mail folders  with automatic filtering to manage that kind of volume. I use Eudora, and  the Palm e-mail application doesn't support its folders or filtering. I  can't even convince it to just download the messages left in my  &quot;in&quot; box after all the others have been filtered out.Being  able to upgrade the operating system on the IIIx turned out to be  important. Version 3.3 of PalmOS supports infra-red sync with a laptop.  This is a godsend when I'm travelling, and for syncing during long  meetings. Being able to upgrade easily from PalmOS 3.1 made it  possible.I have also downloaded a few games to while away long plane  trips -- PocketChess is my favourite. Very easy to play -- just drag 'n'  drop the pieces.I have looked at the Handspring Visor as a replacement,  but lack of upgradeabile OS is a key sticking point. Handspring devices are  stuck at Palm OS 3.1, and Handspring's code seems to have diverged at this  point with no hope of picking up any changes post-version 3.1. Long term,  this could turn into a real problem assuming Palm continues to improve  PalmOS. The Springboard expansion slot is a great idea, but there are so  few expansion cards available that its utility is a joke. Color cases  looked cool -- until I saw them in real life vs. a photo on the web. They  look kinda cheap &amp; nasty.So, I'll probably buy another Palm IIIx.  The IIIe isn't expandable, and I can't see how color is so useful that it  justifies the staggering price of the IIIc. The Palm V looks cool but I'm  even more worried about its fragility, and the Palm VII could be great if  it could actually surf the web, rather than use extraordinarily limited  &quot;web clippings&quot;.",3
"The palm will certainly revolutionize the way you arrange your life. At the touch of a button, you can connect it to your PC and transfer all of its information (which also means you can input information to your palm  from your PC). There's a myriad of freeware available on the net that will  enhance the performance of the Palm IIIx. The screen is great for viewing.  4MB is more than you'll ever need (I have many programs loaded, and  thousands of phone numbers and appointments, and I only use 1.3 MB).The  great advantage of the Palm IIIx is that it uses batteries (versus the Palm  V and Vx, which are rechargeable), which means you don't have to carry your  cradle when you travel, and you can get batteries for it anywhere! Small,  lightweight, highly efficient. I highly recommend it.",5
Pretty easy to use and down load programs for someone that can spell kompooter 2 out of 3 times.,4
"Having used a paper Daytimer for years, I was a little skeptical about going electronic with my datebook and phone listing.  Boy, have I been converted!  The Palm IIIx (my second Palm - the first being a III) is, for  me, a great value.It has enough memory for anyone but the most  compulsive note-taking, yellow page totin' workaholic among us.  (I  download an average of 300 Palm formatted web pages a day and have had no  problem with space in memory at all.  I also keep about 700 phone listings  and several hundred appointments in the unit at all times)  It has the  improved screen and processor versus the III.  And it has the benefit of  the Palm community of software developers that is what sets Palm devices  apart from Windows CE (and other) devices.I like the fold-over cover  both for protection and for the Star Trek communicator look :) and feel.  The backlight takes a little getting used to.  It is not useful at all for  dim daylight use, but works just fine in dark situations.I really want  the Palm Vx for the sexy size and industrial feel, but I have no real  reason to move away from a device that does everything I need and more (and  costs a lot less).",4
"I have had my Palm IIIx for almost 5 years now, and it is still working as well as the day I bought it!  I am more than satisfied with Palm products, and am currently looking into a Tungsten as an upgrade.  The Windows based palmtops are nice too, but they cannot beat the Palm's reliability and ease of use.  The software is also very stable and easy to use.  This is the only device of its kind I own that has never lost data or become corrupted.  Reliability goes a long way with me, so I give it 5 stars!",5
"The big questions these days is what organizer to get. I'll assume you are reading these reviews because you already know that the Palm OS beats CE any day. So the choice is a Palm Vx, a Palm V, a IIIx or a Visor. I can't recommend the Visor right now due to the horrible problems people are  having with Handspring...maybe in another year, but not now.The new Vx  is a good choice, lots of memory and the other advantages of the Palm V  like a better screen, and rechargeable battery. But the darn thing is still  overpriced. If money is no problem though, I'd probably go with the Vx.The V is good too, but only 2 meg of memory...yuck! Now, 2 meg of memory  is going to be enough for a lot of people. If all you want to do is the  basic appointment/phone book/to-do stuff, 2 meg is more than you'll ever  need. But that's it...you're stuck with 2 meg and can't upgrade (easily).  If you are interested in using your Palm to do internet stuff, grab  webpages with AvantGo, play games, read books, etc. you're going to find  yourself a bit squeezed by 2 meg. You can still do quite a bit, but it's a  bit more work to manage your space.Now, for less money you can get the  IIIx. You'll have twice as much memory, and the ability to upgrade. I  personally put on the TRG xtra xtra pro board which gave me 4 meg more of  RAM and 2 meg more Flash...it's like having an 11 meg Palm! Really great.  Of course, I bought this before the Palm Vx came out, today it's not quite  as good a deal to do.One other reason I like the Palm IIIx is that I  have a lot of add-ons that only work with it...the Palm Navigator  (compass), the Weatherguide, Landware's GoVox voice recorder, etc. I don't  believe these will fit a Palm V. Of course, it goes both ways....Palm's new  33.6 modem and the new wireless Omnisky modem only fit the Palm V.I do  believe the Palm V has a better screen, it doesn't seem to have the streaks  that a lot of the Palm IIIx's have. And there's no doubt it has a certain  &quot;coolness&quot; factor. Most of my friends at work went with the Palm  V. But they are fairly impressed with the space and the accessories I have  for my Palm IIIx.",4
"I have to say that I've grown very dependent on my IIIx.  I'd give it a score of 5 except for the streaking problem.  Mine didn't do this right away.  It started hapening about 6 months after I began to use it.  Sometimes its there sometimes it isn't.  When its there, the streaking  (looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing) can make the  screen totally unreadable.  Five minutes later, all can be fine.  PDA need  to be dependable.  Mine isn't always.  Before I started reading other  reviews, I thought mine was just broken.  I was considering buying another  but not if by luck, I get another &quot;streaker&quot;.  Even though I like  the IIIx, its reasonably priced (though still expensive), has great  software options, I'd be cautious about buying another one.  Probably  wouldn't go with the IIIx if I had known about the streaking problem in  advance.",3
"I absolutely love my Palm IIIx.  Originally, my wife ordered a Handspring Visor for my birthday.  Six weeks later, with no indication of when (if ever) the Visor would be shipping, she cancelled it and ordered the Palm  IIIx for me instead.  I've been playing endless with it since.I find,  for example, it's easier to write on the PDA than on paper in a moving car;  hence, car rides can be much more productive.Then I found out about  downloading games from the Internet.  I've been wasting endless amounts of  time playing a beloved game from my college days (&quot;Rogue&quot;).",5
"This is my first DVD after thinking about it for two months.  I've only purchased it since DVD's are entering the Rental market.  With 500 lines of resolution (Using the S-video connector cable), this system has the same  picture quality of any current DVD player (dont be fooled!), The sound can  still be decoded for dolby surround.  Great Buy!",5
"This dvd player is cheap for a reason. You get what you pay for. Most of the time this player works fine. But sometimes the picture will cut out and give you just a blue screen. You can sometimes just tap the machine and it  comes back on, other times you have to stop the movie and open the tray  just to get rid of the blue screen. Luckily this doesn't happen that often.  If you don't have a lot of money to spend on a dvd player, go for it, but  if you can spend more i would recommend something on the higher end of the  scale.",3
"I've had the displeasure of owning two RCA brand DVD players and neither one made it more than a year before breaking.  I had this DVD player and a Proscan DVD/DIVX (which the salesman at [...] SWORE was the best that money could buy).  The RCA DVD just quit working entirely after 11 months (microprocesor).  My [$] Proscan DVD player now displays a ""NO DISC"" message seemingly at random, and for no particular reason.  Sometimes you can put a disc in and it will play the first time, others you have to try it a few times, and on the worst days you may have to try 15-20 times and it still may not work.In both cases I called RCA, sat on hold for some ridiculous amount of time, spoke to someone in technical support who knew nothing about technical support, and was ultimately told it would cost more to repair than to replace.RCA's warranty is useless, their technical support line is an exercise in futility, and I personally don't think it's worth the money to repair any of their poorly engineered products.  I've learned my lesson with RCA and will specifically avoid their products in the future.",1
"Gave it to my brother - not because the first one broke!  I've had it for a year now - and not ONCE did it ever give me a problem - watch the matrix regularly.  I get rental DVD's (more scratched - usually &quot;more  difficult to play&quot;) about twice a week - and in the last 6 months of  renting so frequently I have never had a disc that gave me a problem.Overall, I think there's no reason to buy a more expensive DVD player -  like cd players, they're one and the same unless you're really descriminate  about quality or features not detectable to an average consumer.",5
"I was initially concerned about buying the RCA 5220P DVD player after several of the reviews I read here. However, I decided to give it a try and am thoroughly glad I did. Great picture, great sound! Plenty of features. I  have not experienced a single problem with error messages on any of the  DVD's I've purchased. This is one great little machine for the price!",5
"Not having either a DVD or CD player (I just feed discs to my iMac), I found the discounted price on this model to be all the rationale I needed to invest in such a device.  It's capable of producing flawless images and sounds--unless it chooses not to acknowledge the presence of a disc in its drive, which happens far too often with my temperamental (fastidious?) machine.  I would also advise prospective purchasers to check dimensions, as this model requires extra deep shelves.  Finally, its remote switch is more likely to be compatible with GE or other RCA monitors than with  Philips, Magnavox, or Sylvania monitors.  (It may be important to remember that  a VCR plus DVD assembly requires running the latter in &quot;auxilliary mode,&quot; which is hidden away somewhere in my set's menu choices and virtually inaccessible.)  In short, the machine has done little to alter my high regard for similar products produced by Sony, Panasonic, and other Japanese manufacturers.",3
"I bought this player about a year and a half ago.  It worked great (for about 3 months).  It played all the DVDs and CDs.  Unfortunately, it cannot read VCDs or CD-R/RWs.  For most people that doesn't matter, I guess.  However, only after about 3 months of light usage, the player started to act-up.  Sometimes, it won't read the DVDs--the player indicated &quot;no disc&quot; in player.  I unplugged it and it worked after re-plugging it 1 minute later.  Then, it doesn't work again, and I repeated the same procedure of unplugging.  Finally, I sent the player back to RCA.  Since it was still under warranty, all I had to do was pay for shipping.  It came back after about a month.  It worked, and then I started to see the problem again within a couple of days. I was confused.  Why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work?  So, I tested it out to see the prob. myself.  It appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak, and being unable to read the disc, I thought, could be due to the fact that RCA had provided a weak motor part.  I was half right.  I removed the plug from the UPS/power supply and plugged it directly into the wall.  Ever since, the player was plugged directly into the wall, it shows no problem.  I think I may have found a solution (for now)--the difficulty in reading the disc, I concluded, was due to lack of power [believe it or not].  Well, if you have the same problem, try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player. It might work.Beside this, the machine is good.  It played every single DVDs I've ever rented or bought. I have this hooked up to my reciever through TosLink (optical cable).  The sound is excellent--good proportion of sound from center, satellite, rear and subwoofer.  It plays CD but it takes a second or 2 to skip to songs.  Basically, don't expect it to play it like a real cd player.  It sounded just as good though.  The picture quality is excellent.  Eventhough I don't have an HDTV, I could still clearly see the improvement over the VHS, or BETAMax tapes. I'm getting rid of it now because I want a new and better player that also plays VCDs.",2
"This is a simple, no frills, no gimmicks radio.  Believe it or not, it was hard to find a radio with those qualities.  Modern radios are teeny-tiny, and have tons of &quot;features&quot;.  I needed this radio for someone who was visually impaired, had severe arthritis, and was well beyond the age of dealing with multi-functional gadgets.  Fortunately (?) GE is still in the business of making things &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;.To me, the GE brand has always meant &quot;cheaply made&quot;.  To be fair, it once meant superior quality and cutting-edge innovation, but GE along with General Motors and a few other &quot;Super Conglomerates&quot;, took a vacation from quality and innovation in the latter half of the last century. Now they're madly playing catch-up, and this little radio, even though it's a throwback, is the first sign I've seen that they're making progress.It's a simple am/fm radio.  It's a little too bulky, has very nice monoraural sound, and the knobs are a bit too small for arthritic fingers.  Still, it's just what I needed, and it's the first GE product I've intentionally purchased in over thirty years.  Either my standards are coming down, or they're actually improving their quality.",4
"This is ok if you just want a cheap, portable radio but the reception leaves a lot to be desired. Many AM stations that are easy to get on my other radios were non-existent on this.",3
"I was looking around for a small radio to have at my desk at work. I figured with a smaller unit, I would save space and not have a very good sound. I was wrong about this unit. I was very pleased to listen to the quality of sound from this unit. 2 people that sit near me in my office have enjoyed this radio as well and have ordered one for themselves as well. I highly recommend this product. It is a good price, small, and has a great sound.",5
I wanted a radio to listen to NPR for a few minutes in the morning without putting on the stereo.  I did not want a CD or tape player.  This is a good little basic radio and I am pleased with it.,5
"I bought this for listening to NPR while working on painting and  stenciling projects on our backporch.  I was pleasantly surprised to  discover that it does a good job with music as well as spoken words.  I  also like the fact that it has a solid, metal antenna instead of one of  those thin, whispy wire ones that so interest the feline members of our  household (my husband recently bought a clock radio with one of those  antennas -- after two days it was summarily detached and removed to the  living room for the 2000 Antenna Olympics).  Another nice feature is the  little compartment in back in which you can store the electrical cord.",5
"This radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals. In the fringe area I live in, it doesn't work at all,whereas the little ten dollar Panasonic RF-P50 Pocket AM / FM Radio works quite well.",1
"I needed a cheap radio for background music.  All I wanted was  decent sound and to receive FM radio.  I wasn't interested in playing CDs or MP3s.  Since I do a lot of work around the homestead, I wanted it to be small and easily portable and still have decent sound.  This GE radio delivers on all counts.  I live rurally but still close enough to town that I can't comment on long-distance reception.  All I can say is that I get all the radio stations that I want to listen to, the quality of the speaker is plenty good enough for my taste and level of loudness in FM music, and I don't get any frequency drift so that I don't have to constantly fiddle with the tuning knob.  It's just a great little radio for a very decent price.  The only downside is that the FM antenna is quite flimsy and can be all-too-easily bent if you knock the radio over with the antenna extended.",5
"I bought this radio in order to listen to an AM station in my area that is very weak.  Prior to getting this radio, I couldn't get it to come in on any radio in my house.  Now, I can get it very strong and clear.  The only complaint I have is that the dials on the front for volume, etc. don't seem well made and seems like they could break or come off.  Since I leave it on the same station and same volume all the time, it probably won't be a problem.  It also looks sturdier in the picture than it feels.  It's pretty lightweight plastic.  But, the only reason I got it was to receive this one station, and it does that job well.",4
"Being one of those people that likes to chase late-night AM signals, I was convinced that this was a radio I had to have. I was a bit disappointed in some areas, but still see it as something good. This radio is big. Period. Once loaded with ""D"" batteries, it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions. Quality control seems to vary from set to set, but a few things off the bat that I found were awry for my $50 were:1) Build quality. The switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side, with the chrome finish easy to rub off.2) Dial Markings. For claiming to be a ""DX Machine"", both AM and FM fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy. Best bet is to find your local stations and re-mark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency re-written by hand.3) Audio. For using a large woofer,tweeter, and separate bass and treble controls, the audio quality could be better than it is. It still sounds good, but should be better.On the plus side:1) AM reception is fantastic. By turning the radio to null signals, I was able to pick up a small local on 1040 AM near Rochester, NY, then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on 1040 AM in Salt Lake City. The wide/narrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds2) FM reception is quite good. Picking up low-power locals and larger 75+ mile stations is no problem for this unit. I didn't realize there were so many FM's around until I purchased this radio3) AC power cord. Fits neatly in the back of the radio (albeit a bit cramped), and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signals.Although not quite as good as its predecessor the SuperRadioII, it does what it is designed to do - allow good reception of AM and FM without any bells or whistles to get in the way.If you can find it discounted, then pick one up and listen away. Otherwise, there are better choices to be found in this price range.",3
"So great, I bought one for everyone in my family.  The ultimate Christmas present.  Great range, clear sound and when plugged in it charges the batteries.  Incredibly durable too.",5
"For the price, you can't beat this sturdy radio.  Great sound, and durable.  Use it in the garage and around the deck and it's got great volumn and clarity.  You can't beat the deal that GE is providing.  Second model owned, had their original model for 13 yrs and was so impressed I got a new one.",5
"Most radios you can buy have pretty cabinets, nice paint, and will sound pretty good if you're tuned to a station whose radio beams are about strong enough to cook an egg.  They're designed to impress you in the big box store, where looks and the sound of the most powerful station in town are all you have to go on.  It isn't until you get them home that you find out how miserable they are in real-world performance, trying to pick up that weak station that's the only one carrying the game you want to hear.The GE Superadio is a whole 'nother deal.It's just an AM-FM radio, aggressively avoiding any other features whatsoever.  But it's the gold standard of the type.  When a radio geek wants to say whether some other set is good on FM and, especially, AM, s/he will compare it to the Superadio.To give you an idea how good it is; I live in a semi-remote area without any really strong AM stations.  Sitting side by side on my couch, a typical 'personal stereo' type radio picks up one AM station.  A cheap transistor radio picks up three.  The Superadio picks up 37.I recommend my friends get these as part of their blackout kits.  For one thing, it will run about two hours less than forever on its six D-cells.  For another, this set can pull in AM stations at least two, three hundred miles away, in daylight, any time.  If your blackout extends farther than this radio's range, you've got more important things to worry about.Incidently, it runs off AC also.  It switches to AC automatically when you plug it in, switches back to batteries automatically if AC isn't available.Sound quality is excellent.  It's mono, but it has a good and large speaker and enough audio power to drive it properly.  It also has separate treble and bass controls.I give it four stars instead of five for three reasons:1.  Some of them don't work.  The first one I bought didn't.2.  Stations are hard for me to tune toward the upper end of the AM band.  They're packed very tightly together there, and getting from one to another nearby is fiddly.3.  The ""wide"" bandwidth is useless to me.  There is no radio signal in my area strong enough for it.  I have to use the narrow setting, intended for weak and distant stations, for everything.Still, it's a heck of a radio for remote areas, for camping trips, or if you want to know how well a radio can work if somebody at the company gives a darn.",4
"A friend of mine had this radio for listening to sports.  We live in a small town and have trouble receiving AM stations from the city on normal radios.  With the Superadio, there's no problem.  The tuner is sensitive and easy to use, the speaker sounds good, and the dials are tough.  I think this radio is a perfect part of anyone's emergency kit.  You'd be able to tune in stations from far away in the event of a power outage in your area.  So far I've used mostly the batteries for power and they're lasting nicely (the product instructions say they'll last for 460 hours of on time).  Do yourself a favor and buy this radio, it's a fun toy and a useful tool.",5
"I got this radio to pull in both remote stations, and to have better reception. I also wanted something battery-powered for emergency purposes in case of power failures/earthquakes, etc.First impression is that this is one big, ugly, heavy radio. That impression never goes away, because it is big, ugly, and heavy. The apparent workmanship, fit and finish, looks like it was put together in the dark,  by a developmentally-challeneged monkey, who had lost the instructions. It just looks, frankly, awful. Cheap plastic, poorly made (with all sorts of ""color swirls""), with chrome paint. About like the interior of a mid-70's Chevy.It uses no fewer than 6 ""D"" cells. But the radio is so big you hardly notice. Most of the size comes from the 6"" diameter of the speaker and the enclosure behind it. It probably to about half a barrel of oil to make all the plastic. There's also a very crude perforated metal grate over the speakers. All the knobs and switch *seem* like they will fall of at any moment, and the tuning dial and linear indicator are similarly questionable. It has a handle, and while you can carry it around, it's a ""portable"" radio in the same sense that the original ""beige toaster"" 128k Macintosh was portable.As far as entertainment products go, this radio is the opposite end of the spectrum from the iPod ""Nano"".You might think that you will get some pretty great sound from a 6"" ""woofer"" and a about a 3/4"" ""tweeter. But no - the sound quality, overall, it not very good at all. It always sounds ""tinny"" and while it's plenty good enough for AM voice it's really not much better on FM.But, by golly, it does have absolutely terrific AM reception. Right away, all the""problem"" stations I had before were perfectly clear. With a Terk loop antenna, I spent a few late nights trying to see how many of the 50kW ""clear channel"" stations I could get. With care in tuning the antenna and the radio, I got the Hartford, CT, station on the first try. Didn't last too long, but I got it. This from *Sunnyvale, California*. It's relatively easy to get stations in Wyoming and Nebraska on good nights. Seattle, LA, Salt Lake, no problem anytime, even with the internal antenna.The tuning indicator is nowhere close to accurate and in any case the markings are so crude that you can't reliably set the radio using the existing marks. I just put some paper correction tape on the scale and marked the frequencies with a pencil.One thing that I didn't see in the other reviews, or anywhere else except the instructions, is that the radio is capable of being set to use 20 kHz bandwidth instead of the usual 10, meaning you get a lot better sound than normal. The speakers stink, but the reception is better and the incoming information is less compressed. Of course you want narrow for long-distance listening but if you listen to nearby stations it helps quite a bit.The FM performance is nothing to write home about, hardly any different from any other radio you might buy. It has AFC to help control the drift, and it seems to work just fine. But it's a mono radio, and the speaker quality limits the sound quality. It's bad enough that it will wear you out if you listen to music for long. There are tone controls, but no amount of fiddling with the bass and treble will fix it. If you want a good-sounding FM Radio, get the Tivoli Model One. It's about 3x the price but the sound is about 10x better. It's clear to me that virtually all the price of the GE went into the AM receiver part, and the rest of it was compromised to meet the *very low* price.With the huge battery pack, I suspect it will run a very, very long time on one set. Of course, it can also use AC.Crudity aside, the radio works exactly as advertised, has brilliant AM reception, will probably run forever on a set of batteries, and is so inexpensive for the performance that you really can't go too wrong.p.s.  to clarify, my review is for the *GE* version, not the RCA version, which is still big, ugly, and poorly made - and also has terrible performance. The GE version works well, the RCA does not",4
"As someone who worked for the GE Audio division back when the first Superadio was developed, I can attest to the fact that the product was seriously designed as a very high quality piece.  The engineers had their GE radio reputations on the line, and the concept of good mono vs. bad stereo obviously had market appeal.Over the years, inevitable cost compromise decisions have undoubtedly been made (I was part of some of these types of discussions as well), but when I was looking for a good portable radio, this version was high on the list.  We have been satisfied with our recent purchase and would recommend a listen to anyone interested in good reception and sound.  One problem is that there are relatively few retail outlets at which to check this out, but that's why we have Amazon, right?",4
I bought the original version of this radio back in the late 70s. We've had this one for over two years.  It's a great basic radio with loud enough sound for shop/work use.  We left it in the Vegas sun and it melted the case a little.  It still works!,4
This radio does a great job of receiving local channels and picks up AM stations from hundred of miles away.,5
"Within a couple of hours of unpacking this radio and without an external antenna, I was able to hear and identify five AM stations that were each over 500 miles away from my home here in Mesa Arizona: 1 in Salt Lake City, 505 miles; 1 in Denver, 577 miles; 2 in San Francisco, 666 miles; and 1 in San Antonio, 831 miles. I should point out that this was in the evening, when radio signals travel best.One station that has always been problematic for me (KBAQ 89.5 FM transmitting from the other side of Phoenix) came in loud and almost perfectly clear. Unfortunately, selectivity on this radio's FM band is poor (GE chose fidelity over selectivity in this case), so 90.5 FM in Tucson is completely drowned out by 90.3 FM here in Phoenix. After opening the unit and replacing the stock IF filter with a 150 kHz filter (please read the Superadio FAQ on the Internet for more information), I can now pull in 90.5 as well.Thankfully, the radio has a narrow/wide band switch that lets you choose selectivity on the AM band: ""narrow"" for pulling in those hard-to-tune stations, and ""wide"" for getting extra fidelity from closer stations.At $40, it's hard to go wrong with this radio. The next step up would be a shortwave radio like the Grundig S350 ($100) or the Sangean CCRadio Plus ($150).UPDATE: I have only 2 complaints about this radio:1. Moving the volume control has a big effect on volume at low volume, but a small effect at high volume.2. Because this radio doesn't have a digital PLL tuner, it can be difficult to find a specific station when it also picks up so many other stations on the same part of the dial that you weren't looking for.",5
"If you like to listen to AM talk radion, sports or news this radio is unbeatable.  I have the Sony ICF SW7600GR and the AM section can't hold a candle to the Superadio III.Personally I think the tuning and volume pods are smooth and fairly precise compared to what others have found.  I am amased that this unit gets the job done for $40.00.It does what it says.  Hope this is helpful.",5
"It is very large but does have pretty good sound and reception, I live in an area where some people cannot get half of what I get on this unit....buy again because of performance...yes.....buy again .... maybe not because of size being so large....",4
"I've owned my GE superadio III for about 3 months now.  I'd heard a lot of (mostly) favorable things about this legendary series of radios, and had to get one.  I'm glad I did.  Here's what I think.....Strong points:1)  Great AM reception.  Even during the day it's not difficult to pick up stations up to a couple of hundred miles away.  At night, it can be several hundred miles.  This radio has an 8"" ferrite antenna, and when you hook up an external antenna like the C Crane Twin Ferrite, it really gets good.2)  Very good FM reception (although I must admit I mostly just listen to AM talk radio.)3)  Big 2-way speaker puts out nice, full sound.4)  Separate bass and treble controls.5)  Very long battery life (6 D-cells)6)  AC cord included (but not used most of the time.)7)  Great VALUE.  You could easily spend 2 or 3 times as much to get a radio that doesn't approach this performance.Not-so-strong points:1)  It's a big radio.  It won't fit in your pocket or briefcase, but it's no boombox either.2)  The analog tuning dial is not very accurate (as noted by many others.)3)  Build quality is about middle of the road.  (But still good for the price.)4)  No presets, no clock, no weather band, no SWI currently do not own a C Crane Radio Plus, which I find the Superadio III most often compared to, but it's also 1/3 the price.I own a lot of radios (more than 75 at last count).  I listen to this one almost every day (for at least part of the day), so I think that says something.If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive, but highly appreciated gift for a talk radio fan, this is it.  If you're looking for a cool radio for a young person, this probably ain't it.  If you're into talk radio, or you want to have some fun with AM DX-ing, then get one for yourself.",4
This was my third purchase of this Model.  I had been using these for listening to stations distant to my rural home for several years but this 'New' set didn't have near the range or tone quality of the prior sets that I had purchased over the  years.  I changed to CC Radio plus Sets which do what I had wished this GE set would do.,2
"Just give me a good AM/FM radio that performs.  The Superadio III does exactly that!  The AM is so potent it's like having AM shortwave - so MANY stations can be found - all over the USA.  The first night I ran it through it's capabilities, from NC we were clear receptioned in Chicago, Miss, Cleveland, NY, and other places that didn't identify.  Great trip.  And the FM reception is exceptional too and the sound is clear, rich and full.Yes, it's on the bulky side, not many bells and whistles, but for the price, it's a real champ.  Trying to convince my wife to get another one.  When it was suggested she could use that one for outside; battle won.  Great radio!P.S. If your battery compartment clips on your super Superadio 111 don't all snap into place, and if you haven't thought of it yet, fold a small piece of paper and wedge it into the 'V' of the offending clip(s) and voil&agrave;, the compartment is closed tightly. Now it's a 5 star radio!",5
"I purchased this item, then in afterthought read the reviews listed here.  So I was prepared for some rickety thing that had parts ready to fall off when you touched it, and a viewfinder that was as accurate as throwing a baseball at the tuner knob.  But the promise of awesome reception was all I needed to hear.First off, I work in a building which has a lot of electrical interference.  I needed something to get past that.  That was my only concern.  So it didn't much matter, as long as I could get past the interference.  Now that you know that, let me tell you about this thing.First of all it's not HUGE.  I'm 40 right now, so I've seen rickety bulky radio's that would kill if it hit you.  This is a nice unit, well sized for the speakers and antenna's in it.Second, it's very well built.  I tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect.  Even the volume, treble and Bass buttons nicely placed on the unit can't be removed without some extra tool.  The switches are only two function switches, and are well built.  Granted it doesn't light up, and the tuner bar isn't a lit bar, but who cares, it's very well built.  I tried to squeeze the unit to see if I could make it crack, no, it's sturdy.Now, for the TUNING ability.  There is a WIDE and NARROW switch, which can either give you a very narrow tuning area, or a much WIDER tuning area.  A station I listen to at 740am appears on the WIDE area from 700 to about 750 on the dial.  However on the NARROW switch, it only comes in within a few millimeters of where 740 is.  That explains why people say the tuning was so bad, they had it set to wide.So all things said and done, how did it do against the interference?  Now basically I'm stuck in an area which is nothing short of several high tower power poles.  The improvement was marginal.  BUT to my surprise there are additional AM/FM jacks on the back that you can add an additional antenna or signal amplifiers to &lt;G>  I grabbed a power cord, wrapped it around the AM port, and between the improvement in tuning, signal grabbing, and the extra antennae, I'm getting very decent reception with only a small bit of hissing.This is a very nice radio, well worth every penny I spent on it.  Hope this review helps.Ed Williams, Colorado Springs, CO",5
"I have always enjoyed listening to far away AM stations at night (DXing) and this radio is one of the better ones for that purpose, even compared to much more expensive radios. It is simple to use with a large internal ferrite antenna. I have never connected it to an external antenna (screws for this are on the back) or antenna tuner, which I imagine would improve reception. Most new radios have digital synthesized tuners and while that adds tuning accuracy, it often adds noise that is bad for DXing. This radio is not the best built and has known quality control issues such as tuning inaccuracies that can be rectified. It isn't tiring to listen to because it has good sound quality due to the large main speaker, tweeter and bass/treble controls. The FM section works very well too. I do not DX FM so can't comment on it's long distance capabilities but it sounds good and holds the stations well. It uses long running D cells but I use the internal AC power supply - the AC cord is permanently attached.There are many reviews of this storied radio on the net you can read so I won't go on and on. It looks like the RCA model replaced the GE but I imagine it is the same radio other than the name on the front.I was fortunate to find a Superadio II at a thrift store and enjoy that earlier model as well.",5
"I've owned a GE SUPERADIO since 1985. Works great. Sounds Fantastic. Pulls in stations from great distance.  Seems bulletproof. I especially enjoy the Old School knobs and dials. They are no- brainers. Spin the dial, turn it up. Done. No digging into digital layers.",5
"I have several Superadio's, both II's and III's.  I'm not particularly wild about their redesign of the III's case (the II had a tremendous generic radio look to it), but the reception and audio quality is about the  same. As other reviewers have noted, the dial accuracy is poor, so you have  to &quot;learn&quot; each Superadio's setting, but once you learn where  stations are, they stay put.This is a superb radio, with surprisingly  good sound and excellent reception. I have one at work, one in the kitchen,  and one that I tote around (to the beach, to the driveway for carwashing,  to the b-ball court).  Versatile, solidly built and nice priced.",5
"I bought this radio in the early nineties to be my night companion. It's showing signs of wear now, doesn't tune like it used to, and the antenna doesn't stand up anymore (keeps flopping over), but the SuperRadio has been more than worth the money, although I don't remember buying it for as much as they want for it here!",4
"If you love AM radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios: the ccradio plus and the GE Superadio. These are the best radios on the market for fans of talk, sports, Art Bell, Phil Hendrie, etc. Which one should you buy? I have both (the GE for my office, ccradio for home) so here is my take on the two. Both have nearly equal AM reception. At night, you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away (some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live). There the difference ends. The ccradio has a lot of features that I felt I wanted in a radio. It has a sleep timer, accurate digital tuning, automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time, scan buttons, lighted dial, power cord (not bulky adaptor), weather radio (with auto alert), memory buttons, tv audio of the network stations. The only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle. They are a family business and take GOOD care of their customers. The ccradio company LOVES radio and loves people who share their passion. Is it worth the [$$] for the extras? To me it is. The Ge Superadio has a rotary - and inaccurate - tuning dial. This will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching. Some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations - it is that inaccurate. There is no timer, no alarm, no weather, no tv audio, no lit dial, etc. The sound is better on the GE Superadio, though. The GE SUperadio feels cheaply made and probably won't make it through many beach or camping excursions. The GE Superadio is enormously sized - it is the size of a small attache case or TV! If you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station, get the GE radio. That is all you need. It has great, almost legendary, reception without any bells or whistles. On the other hand, if you love radio, need the extras, change stations a lot, want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime, want to explore the large number of AM stations that are out there, go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception (see their website to order). I am a radio person rather than a tv person. I have radio playing all day (as some people have tv going on all day). I sleep to radio (and need that sleep timer). I would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com. I would rather listen to Coast to coast, Phil Hendrie, and Rush than watch another rerun of Frasier or Friends. If you are like me, do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio. You won't regret it. P.S., the FM reception will be better than you are used to, also.Bottom line: The GE superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky. The CCradio plus is expensive, has every extra you could want (except a decent handle), more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the GE for music.",5
"The RCA Superadio is a very sensitive, great sounding AM-FM radio.  It pulls in stations from out of town and out of state, which will expand your listening choices.  (And is just darn interesting to boot.)It is a big, heavy unit - more than 6 pounds with batteries.  Not exactly a iPod, but is fine for carting around the house to listen to while you clean up the garage.This isn't a DXing (long distance radio aficionado)radio.  For that, you would want digital readout and more control over reception characteristics.  This is a radio for those those who love the medium, listen a lot, and want a set that doesn't sound cheap and tinny.This can also make a very good home emergency radio.  Keep it on batteries (I've easily run it more than 100 hours on a set, using it a couple of hours a day) use it for everyday listening while you get ready for work in the morning or make dinner in the evening.  When the power goes out or the alien spaceships land, turn to it to find out what's going on.There are radios that are a skootch above the Superadio in reception and sound - the C Crane CC Radio2 and Sangean PR-D5 among them. But the Sangean is at least twice as expensive, the CC Radio four times so.  For less than $50 you can have a high-quality radio that will serve you for many years.  Every household should have one.Get it while you can - it seems RCA is not making it any more, or have cut back on production - a lot of retailers that stock it are no longer carrying it.",5
"It is my misfortune to live in a ""fringe"" FM reception area;  the station I regularly listen to is 75 miles away.  I have tried various combination shortwave/AM/FM radios  over the past few years and none had better than ""so-so"" sound on FM.  I'd read about this radio for many years and when I saw it on Amazon , figured it was worth a try.  I have been very pleasantly surprised!  The radio is very large, but has very large speakers that, combined with separate bass and treble controls, produce a very good quality sound.  The tuner section is highly sensitive, even on FM. After I loaded the six D cells into it, I have never even plugged it into the wall and it has been used daily for several hours for many months now. The build quality is a little cheesy, but if it weren't it would weigh as much as an anchor.  If you want good quality audio and reception at a very reasonable price and don't mind a large portable, this is a winner.",4
"I loved my SRIII.  Solid sound quality, excellent AM receptivity (but only average FM receptivity).But it wasn't very hardy.  I took it camping once, and it was never the same after that.  It took several minutes to ""warm up"" after you turned it on, and then the sound was distorted for several minutes after that.  And scratchy sounds came out of the speaker when you adjusted the volume.  I figure the radio didn't like the humidity of the day and the dew of the morning.",4
"I bought this radio as a garage/workshop unit for use when tinkering around.  I wanted something that had no gimmicks, that plugged into the wall, was analog tuned, so there was no power draw or batteries to worry about when it is off, and so that I know it will last me a LONG time without an LCD failure or whatnot.This radio definitely delivers.  Sound quality is awesome, reception is top notch, and it does exactly what I desired it to. Not small, trendy or stylish - if youre looking for that, go elsewhere.  But for a rugged, quality unit, with good sound from one speaker, you cant do much better.",5
"Some products seem to predict their own futures.  Corning Ware was introduced long before anyone even knew what a microwave oven was and it turned out to be the best cookware for the ubiquitous food zapper.Now, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III takes its place among such prescient products.  Your humble communications technician, seeking to hear another human voice  while on the job in a computer room, found the Superadio III remarkably  well suited to the computer room environment.I had previously brought a  Grundig Yacht Boy 400 and a Sony ICF-2010 to work to listen to an AM talk  radio station, only to find out that what makes them so good for world band  (shortwave) reception are the very things that meant disaster in the  computer room's EMI (electro-magnetic interference) rich atmosphere.  Being  digital receivers, their computer-like circuits eagerly plucked from the  air the squeals, drones and squawks of the network servers, PCs and PBX  system that occupy the room while adding their own synthesizer noise to the  weakened signal.  I pondered the possibilities for better reception.  I  could put the radio nearer an exterior wall, crank up the volume loud  enough to hear while seated at my desk, and be promptly thrown into the  parking lot, since others in the room don't really want to hear the same  station.  Through the interference on the Sony came a commercial for the  CCRadio by C. Crane, a tabletop receiver specially designed for long  distance reception of AM news and talk radio stations (Translation: The  speaker ain't so hot for music).  Pricey but perhaps worth it.I read a  few reviews of the CCRadio and another model kept popping up as the  undisputed CHAMP of Long Distance AM Radio Reception, the standard against  which other contenders are measured, the one, the only, ladies and  gentlemen, let's hear it for the GE 7-2887 Superadio III.  Wow, I thought,  how often I had seen them at WalMart and Kmart and how often I said to  myself, yeah, right, Superadio, ha ha.  Yet, here were some of the  toughest-to-please SOBs who ever twiddled a tuning knob using this radio as THE benchmark.  I was intrigued.A quick visit  to the usual suspects (Best Buy, WalMart, Kmart) proved fruitless  (&quot;Sorry, if it's not on the shelf, we're out. . .No, I don't know when  we'll have more&quot;).  In desperation, I came to Amazon.com, typed  &quot;superadio&quot; in the Search box and there it was in all its  &quot;usually ships in 24 hours&quot; glory, and for less than  the best street price.  2 UPS Second Day Air days later, it was waiting for  me at home.  I didn't unbox the radio until I was back at work the next  day.Even before digging into my Sausage McMuffin with Egg breakfast, I  unpacked the Superadio III, plugged it in and was, indeed, amazed.  The  interference no longer dominated the signal from Los Angeles radio station  KFI.  It was still there, but not as much as on the Sony and Grundig.  The  Superadio III's analog tuner is, by its nature, more immune to it.  Throwing the WIDE/NORMAL switch to the NORMAL position reduced much of the  interference.  Judicious tuning and adjustment of the separate bass and  treble controls brought forth the desired sound while further fading the  interference to a tolerable level.  Thanks to the 2-speaker sound system,  the Superadio III delivers more &quot;presence&quot;, allowing it to sound  louder even though the volume might be lower than on a radio with inferior  sound.At the minus end of the scale is the tuning scale itself.  The  aforementioned station at 640 kHz appears between the 650 and 700 markings  (675 kHz?).  If you do a lot of station hopping, keeping a station list  with each's position on the 1-to-10 &quot;log scale&quot; above the AM and  FM scales might be a good idea.  Made in China and imported by Thomson  Consumer Electronics, the Superadio III has a less-than-substantial feel to  its construction and controls.  Better-built radios DO come out of China  (can you say &quot;Grundig&quot;?) but they also cost accordingly.For  its price, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio does just what  you buy it for and will probably continue to do so for many years to come  as more and more computer room hermits discover its ability to bring the  outside world inside.  They can block your access to Web radio, but they  can't stop you from listening.",4
I Like this radio. Pulls in AM stations great. Has nice sound quality. I've even dropped this on the floor a few times. Still works great. Very durable. Battery life is excellent! Happy with this radio.,5
"It receives and plays mono radio (AM and FM) exceptionally well.  It sounds great, with surprisingly good bass.At 13""x9""x4"", it isn't small.  And it it isn't light either, with 6 D batteries in it.  But I'll bet this heft is what makes the bass sound so good.I bought it because I wanted a good, inexpensive, big, vertical-format portable radio (I'm tired of the huge footprint and squatting look of most boomboxes today).  I wish it had digital tuning, but it doesn't.  The analog dial might not be very accurate, but in my experience, analog tuning has *never* been accurate.  I've always had to tune by ear rather than eye.Features: Power switch (button) is separate from the volume control.  So you won't be wearing out the volume knob every time you turn it on.  Bass and Treble controls.  A mono headphone out (meant for stereo headphones -- you get the same signal in each ear).  Loud.  Easily fills a good-sized room with sound.  On AM, it has an optional ""wide"" mode which can give you really great sound on some AM stations, at the price of selectivity.  On FM it has optional automatic frequency control which grabs the nearest strong FM signal (you may wish to turn off AFC for weak FM signals near strong stations).  It has terminals for external FM and AM antennas.  It has a nice, 36"" long FM antenna, and a 20cm internal ferrite rod for AM.  It has a nice handle on top, the kind that bangs into the FM antenna if the antenna is extended, so be careful.  There's no light on the tuning dial.  Again, you must tune by ear.Heavy, however, doesn't necessarily mean hardy.  Everything is plastic on it except the antenna and the speaker grille.  Since it is heavy and somewhat tall, I fear the time when it first will fall over.  Best to treat this radio kindly -- I'm not sure how long the switches will last.  But for kindly indoor use, assuming you don't like to switch stations often, it's great.What you are paying for here, though, is the reception, which is excellent.  The Superadio III is not a tank.",4
"and I bought one for my dad also. The thing I like about it is it pulls in the AM stations very well. I listen to a lot of talk radio in the office and the other *cheap* boom box type radios cannot cut through the computer generated RF but this one discriminates and I can hear the stations. Also, the large speaker works wonderfully for rich sound better than most stereo boxes. It is also very inexpensive. I would recommend to anyone.",5
"So, If CC Crane is listing this along with their awesome collection of MW & SW radios - wouldn't you get it too? I looked long and hard - Crane was ok, but I already had a Grundig PE 400 and wanted a radio for primarily AM reception (I like to DX from time to time) GE Superradio III does the trick, and I got it from Amazon for 39.00!! Target doesn't even carry it anymore, and Sears does for $70. What a ripoff!! Thanks to Amazon - they paid for the shipping (Got it before Christmas) and came in tight packaging with no problems whatsoever. This is the best radio in the business, I get KGO from SF like a local LA station at night - no static like my other units. Thanks. JG",5
"The GE Superadio III is impossible to beat. Long battery life (6 D cells), superb AM sound that can be made even better on strong signals by switching it to &quot;wide&quot; bandwidth mode, and sensitivity that allows me to listen to NY and NJ AM stations during the day at my home in MD, using just the Superadio's built-in antenna.The only way it could be better would be to have a digital frequency display, but the analog &quot;dial&quot; is OK enough once you get used to it.The FM section is no slouch, either. Mine picks up a distant high-school station without even extending the antenna. And, the Superadio is also one of only two radios I've ever been able to use at home (near a busy tower) with no front end overload problems at all. (The other radio is a discontinued model that cost 2.5 times as much--in 1970 dollars--as the Superadio does now.)",5
"This is, by far, the best radio you can buy for AM/FM reception.  The AM reception is fantastic, with a super-large internal AM antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for hard-core 'DXing.  FM reception is so good you don't need the AFC function, but is only in monaural.  Tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners.  There is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thing.The six D-cell batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms, power outages, and to tune in far-off stations without electrical interference.  The power supply is well shielded from noisy power sources.The sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble, which is perfect for attenuating static and whine.  The speaker is enormous and the radio features a high-quality tweeter.  The sound quality both on AC and batteries is super-powerful.The volume and bass/treble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but that's the only complaint I have.  The antenna is easily replaced if damaged.  It seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not water-resistant.I have several of these radios and have given them as gifts.  There appears to be some variance in quality between units, such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion, but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker.  Some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency you're tuning, but I don't think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway.This is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale.  The regular price is excessive, though, even for this level of quality.**EDIT**  In 2010, this radio is now known as the RCA Superadio III.  Model numbers include RCA 7-2887 and RCA RP7887.  I am listening to the original, reviewed item right now, and I'm glad to see the line is still being produced even if it is under the throwback RCA brand.",5
"Yeah, it's made of plastic.  Don't throw it down the stairs then.  Just put it where you want it and enjoy it.  Now that I've got mine set up where it can pick up stations and I've got the volume and tone set the way I want, all I do with the controls is switch between the same two stations on occasion.  So I suspect this radio will last a while.These radios are especially useful if your home office is partially or completely below ground, like in a finished basement.  Or, if you work in a metal framed office building and you want to listen to talk radio.AM signals are directional.  You need to find the location of the transmitting tower for the station you want to listen to, and then point the radio toward the tower.  That's what I did and I can listen to radio in a place where nobody else can.It's also a good general purpose portable radio for sitting out on your deck listening to the game or music or whatever.  It's not as bulky as a ""boom box"" but it's got better speakers than most portable radios, so it just sounds better in return for a slightly higher price.Postscript:  In all fairness to those who comment on the build quality, I will say that my radio stays in one place tuned to one channel and maybe tuned to a second channel on occasion.  I hardly adjust the controls at all.  So, maybe those who are complaining about the construction quality have a point.  I'm just not using this radio in a way that involves moving it or manipulating the controls much.  It has a very easy life.",5
"Good sound, good options. A bit larger than you might think from the picture. Sound is good, as is reception. I have it on the back corner of the desk as background music.",4
"It's big, it's bulky, and you can't carry it while you're roller blading, but the GE Superradio has the best AM and FM reception of just about ANY  portable radio on the market, short of a $500 Lowe. It's especially valued  for its sensitive AM reception (it's a favorite of AM broadcast band  &quot;DXers&quot; chasing distant stations) but the FM reception is nearly  as good. Spend some time listening to it in the evening and you'llbe amazed  how many AM stations are out there that you never suspected existed.After I loaned mine to a builder friend working on my house, he ran out  and bought one; his old job site radio just couldn't get his favorite  stations. He listens to it at home now, too. For the money there's just  nothing else that even comes close.",5
"I've been a radio buff for years, AM/FM/Shortwave, have tried receivers from bargain-basement level to the $1000+ digital jobs, and can't tell you the number of times I've responded to another radio by thinking ""pretty good AM receiver, but not quite up to the old Superadio III""If you want the best AM reception possible and demand the convenience of digital tuning, get a CCRadio for about $150-$165.If you listen in an area that gets poor reception, like a basement, you may need a more expensive receiver that can accept an external antenna.But if all you want is the best AM reception and great FM sound at a reasonable price, the matter is simple and clear - get a Superadio III.And by all means run it on batteries - the D cells give the unit a wonderful heft that keeps it stable and even seems to improve the sound somewhat, and are remarkably long-lasting.Hope that helps.",5
"The Superradio III is a one of a kind radio that will get you far better AM reception than even the legendary Grundig S350. Its FM is equal to the Grundig S350 and its speaker is even bigger and fuller. I can't overemphasize this speaker. It can fill an entire house. It's the biggest speaker of any radio I own, including my Grundig S350.The Superradio III's AM is leaps and bounds beyond any radio you can buy. No comparison. And the reason is plain: Other radios have a conventional four-inch internal ferrite AM antenna. The Superradio's ferrite antenna is in contrast eight inches.Weak points? Well, the cheap build quality and you have to suffer with a less than precise spin dial. Also some don't like its huge size. But for the price I can't fault the radio. For strong AM/FM reception with a big full speaker than can fill a huge room, look no further. Buy a Superradio III for one-fourth the cost of radios that won't give you as much bang for your buck.At this price point, the Superradio III blows away the competition.",5
"This baby is about the size of a couple of laptops stacked and turned on edge. It's hard to miss almost anywhere you put it, and probably too big to look OK on your desk.But the sound is huge and there is much less AM buzzing (pretty much none!)than I've experienced with the half-dozen other radios I've tried in my house over the years.I listen to just two AM stations, so tuning has not been a problem for me.The Superadio has a plug coiled out of the way in the battery compartment, so you have it if you need it. And since this is no Walkman, you may find yourself able to plug it in more often than you might expect.",5
Really excellent reception.  Very good sound quality.  Separate treble and bass controls.I was surprised by the good reception.  Highly recommended.,5
I recently recieved this item. The reception is about the same as my Grundig s350. I took off 1 star  because on fm I cant get 103 cleary but my grundig can get it better. Is it because the antena is too small? Or is it that I need to modify it??? The am reception is good. The sound is better than the grundig s350!!! Over all the radio is good.,4
"Very sensitive radio on AM, widely considered the best buy for the money by far.  Very popular in prisons because of its daytime distance performance.Sound is top rate.Dial calibration is poor but you can  get used to it.It's exactly as sensitive as the CCRadio at $160 with  much better sound than the CCRadio.  Lacks only the CCRadio's digital  tuning.  Sorry, Art Bell.",5
"I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to get decent FM radio reception in the middle of an office building with significant EMI (Electromagnetic Interference).  I tried three radios, including the Radio Shack (RS) Portable AM/FM Radio with Extended AM Range, Cat# 12-903, which is modeled after the GE Superadio.  (The Superadio and the RS 12-603/12-903 are often compared out on various pages on the internet and have the exact same features.)  My goal was to receive my favorite FM station, which is a weaker station sandwiched between two strong stations.  The Superadio, with the help of a C. Crane FM Reflect antenna found at ..was the only radio/antenna combo that would bring it in for me. (I also tried 3 other antennas, including 2 amplified antennas)  Another nice item is that I get excellent FM reception on almost every channel now.  The ability to turn off the Auto Frequency Control seems to make all the difference for my needs.  The RS 12-903 had the same switch, but I didn't notice a significant difference when I turned it on or off, like I do with the Superadio.  The only thing the RS 12-903 had going for it was it's sturdier case, but it was  more, even on sale.  I haven't done much with AM, so I can't comment on that.  I hope this is helpful.",5
"I only use Superadio III for FM.Plusses:(1)  Selectivity and sensitivity are excellent, and comparable to the Tivoli PAL (which costs over $100).(2)  The sound quality for the spoken word is quite adequate.Minuses:Note that to me the only significant Minus is #1.(1)  The III's reproduction of music is poor-to-unacceptable.  I've even tried playing music through up to eight IIIs (yes, eight!) to see if the lack of musical sound quality was due to simple lack of amplification; it's not.(2)  Both IIIs that have stopped working for me did so because the on-off (silver) button while appearing to be in the down-on position in fact wasn't low enough to turn the III on.  Fortunately one can solve this problem by wedging a dime between the button and the case.(3)  Should you try to tune to the same station using multiple IIIs at the same time (as I do), there's a noticeable variation between IIIs in where on the dial that same station appears.Considerations:(1)  Sounds best when both bass and treble are at halfway on (that is, if the control were numbered from 1 to 10, it would be at 5).(2)  The bass control adds more distortion that bass.(3)  The headphone jack takes a stereo (mini) plug (even though not surprisingly the sound through the headphones is monaural), which I consider to preferable to a monaural jack, because effectively all headphones have stereo plugs.(4)  According the the User's Manual, that Normal-Wide button works only on AM, not FM.",4
"If you love a place, you accept it warts and all.The biggest wart I have had to live with is that while I live in a pretty civilized and tech savvy area, Santa Clara Valley, I also live in the crotch of foothills and at the bottom of said holler.For years TV reception was horrible until we got cable.But, radio reception never improved.  We went through a half dozen radios attempting to find something that could grab a specific PBS station we enjoyed most, KQED from San Francisco.Can you imagine hearing Garrison Keillor over a crystal set?Things changed for the better only after we followed a recommendation in Amazon to this GE portable.Somehow, I think it is a tuner knob that is a precise as a laser knife and a tuning band that seems a foot and a half wide, we can nail the signal.  After that it is a matter of playing with AFC, bass, treble and a view other variables to pull in a signal that is not only there but pretty good.The only real drawbacks come from sun spots: when they flaired we could could hear them.  And oh, for a while we heard a neighbor use her cordless phone, which was odd and entertaining for a couple of Saturdays until we figured it out and knocked on some doors.The only circumstance that changed our way of life with  the GE came with internet radio.When the internet has gone down (it has), out comes the GE.  If you live without cable or the internet in some fringe reception hell as did we, get this radio.Good listening.",5
"This radio compares favorably to my two CCRadios....It has a slide rule tuning system, and you can more accurately tune into a specific station. At night, the selectivity switch really shines, as you can tune in distant stations easily, or eliminate the interference...It is a different radio, and I like both this one and the CCRadios....For the money, unbeatable.  The tuning dial is not at all accurate, but that is no big deal, once you know where the stations are that you want to tune in....I also like the advertised battery life, although I have not tested the longevity of the batteries yet.So I say get one of these even if you are going to get a CCRadio....they are both pretty much the best am radios going...",5
"Being a former ham radio operator in the 60's, I appreciate the features GE put back in their ""SUPERRADIO"" that used to be standard.  The best is the tuned RF stage that pulls in distance stations with ease.  Second is the dual power feature: a line cord comes built in, and in battery mode, it takes 6 ""D"" cells so they last a very long time.  Third, Two loudspeakers give amazing soundquality and volume.  It's hard to believe you can buy this for under $50.00! This is a great radio and I will be buying more forChristmas presents.",5
"This is the best sounding radio ever, especially for it's size!!!  You can adjust the bass &amp; treble to your liking!  I have the first one I purchased many years ago, it still works perfectly!!  I have recently purchased an additional one, it is just as good as the original.  It is easy to bring in stations on this radio that don't come in clearly on other radios.  This is a solid, sturdy radio, like the ones from years ago.  The radio has a full, rich warm sound, from its large speaker. It is hard to believe a radio so compact can sound so big and wonderful!",5
"I bought this a while back for the garage and was fairly disappointed. It uses old tuning technology and the station would continually drift. The sound was ok, but a little bassy. I'm guessing a lot of people buy it for nostalgic reasons. I ended up selling it.",3
"First of all, this is a fine radio for AM radio reception.. BUT, the radio that I received is bad. Intermittently, the volume goes down to nothing..I can hear it only humming..A one year warranty comes with it and I bought mine about two months ago.. It's going back but I'm afraid that since the problem is intermittent, it won't be fixed.. Been there, done that..Never the less, it's a great radio as far as reception..Guess what? I bought another one today.. One for work, one for home use.. I'm sure I'll have to do without the original for a while it's being repaired though.I rate this radio very high for sound quality and reception (design) yet very low for quality of the build.. Never-the-less, they do have a year warranty unlike most consumer products which generally are 90 days..Keep the reciept.",3
"This is just a fantastic product.I've owned two for fifteen years and hope they never stop making this model in case I want another.The sound is great, the reception is great, the price (was) great; the durability is great and the battery usage is great.  It's all great.It is certainly not ""feature rich"" but who needs all that nonsense for AM and FM radio?  More feature would just get in my way.TIP: The radio has a ground screw on the back which I'm guessing most people don't use. After hooking up a long wire outdoor antenna, I noticed that what really helped AM DX reception was the ground!I bought a grounding rod from Radio Shack to isolate the radio from the noisy house wiring system. (I pounded in the rod in the ground outside the house.) That REALLY helped! So much so, that I removed the wire antenna and now only use the ground.",5
"I ordered one of these right here on Amazon back in Jan 2004, my specimen was probably manufactured in 2003. I should use it more than I have, but it still works very well. Of all my other radios, only the old Panasonic &#34;all-chrome&#34;  model(RF-1600?) can shade it on AM, and the difference is *very* small, at best. On FM, the extra long whip antenna really helps here in the semi-sticks, and it does very well, if not quite up to my little Grundig G8 with DSP. Sound from the big speaker is excellent. Recently I've begun using it late on Sat nights to listen to 1120 AM from St. Louis- a long way from NE Texas! Fades in/out a bit less than my best smaller radios on that. Mine even has a fairly accurate tuning scale- tunes 650 WSM with the needle centered on the &#34;6&#34; of &#34;650&#34;, 1200 WOAI with needle on the &#34;2&#34; of &#34;1200&#34;- certainly too close to try & modify. Battery life is looong, too- manual states about 400 hrs on 6 alkaline D-cells. Want to use AC instead? Power cord & transformer are built-in, no wall wart to get lost.Warts? Power switch seems a little fragile, no light for the slide-rule  dial. Some will miss a tuning LED lamp, and though it will handle headphones, no FM stereo through 'phones.Best testimony I've seen was from someone near New Orleans who had no power for weeks after Katrina, all local radio stations were knocked off-air, he used one of these as his primary radio to get news & info over AM stations.I've read lots of reviews stating that the later versions sold under the RCA name are problematic. Maybe so- but if you can find one of the GE models at a reasonable price somewhere- and you like radios- my advice is get it quick before someone else does!",5
"I just purchased this radio. It has an excellent reception comparable to portable radios that cost over [price], and the quality of sound is very good.Pros:- reception quality on both AM and FM bands;- has a built-in power cord, may use batteries as well.- attractive price for the quality you get.Cons:- a bit heavy, I assume primarily due to speakers (it has two, one of which is quite large) and built-in power adapter;- cavity in the back to hide the thick power cord can barely accommodate the cord; I managed to back it back after several tries.- vernier (non-digital) tuning and no ability to pre-program stations; at the same apparently due to excellent reception, dial range for stations is very large, so tuning to a station is not a problem at all.- built-in power adapter makes a constant humming noise that at lower volume levels can be heard within 2-3 ft form the radio; I assume this is not a problem when using batteries.",4
"I am not going to repeat all previous reviewers on excellency of AM and FM receiving.  It's all true.  But quality of product is just horrible.  Look, I formerly lived in Ukraine and Soviet Union and to tell you the truth I haven't seen such horrible finish and quality in Soviet portable radios.  Quality or a lack of it is just appalling.  The tuning knob will fell off very soon.  There's no soft material under battery door-so battery rattle (I put some paper inside it cured rattle).  I understand this product made in China, but look you can buy Sony, Grundig, or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in China, as a matter of fact, almost everything nowdays made in China.  It's not a question whether or not something made in China it's a matter how good it made there.  This radio is obviously was made in garage in China.  Just tell me why, but why there's no light on tuning scale, how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb.  GE seems not to care about quality of their product at all.  I wouldn't ever buy this product for looks.  It looks awful, but reception on AM is excellent, yes it is.",4
"it is sensitive and because of it range, you can tweek in stuff from far away, and then flick a switch and pow even more range....had a halicrafters 3 band radio beck when I was a kid, it had range with the external antenna, but this is a very good radio, under battery power or plugged in..............good buy for the price!!!!!",5
"That's right - excellent AM radio. Good for news and talk radio, good for music of the 70's also, a true re-production of the 70's impression. :-) For AM programming, this is my choice. However, for FM and concert music, I go with Trevolie Model One, it's simply amazing and inspiring. And for an all around portable radio, the Grundig S350 is my choice, it is much more refined and functional. All three are keeper in my book. In my search of a portable radio, I bought all three within two month time frame and am very happy with the flexibility and quality I get.follow up to my initial review back to August 2004, my superadio is still on the first set of battery and working nicely, no trouble whatsoever. So far, I am convinced if it does not pick up the signal (both AM and FM), pretty much that's it; the station is out of range. I use it mostly for AM, yet, FM reception is just as good. By itself and tuned at a moderate leve, the sound quality is ok. Overall, a nice radio and well worth the money.",5
Work well for signing things,5
"This stylus is metal with a high quality plastic tip, thus giving it some needed weight and smoothness when compared to Palm's pure plastic &quot;cheapo&quot; stylus.  The end unscrews and reveals a pin to reset your Palm in the rare case it crashes.  A small purchase that makes a big difference.",5
"Why Are You Even Reading The Reviews?  They Get Lost Easily, They Get Easily Left At The Office, And They're Inexpensive...Go Get Some More...",5
"These stylus' are much better than the generic plastic one that comes with the Palm IIIxe.  These stylus' are much more rugged, and reliable and are built to last.  You should definately replace Mr. Default Stylus.  The reason being that these new Metal stylus' will improve your grafitti skills 10-fold!  Another convenient feature of this stylus is that the top unscrews to reveal a reset tip.  (Much better than hunting around for a paper clip to reset your device)  Pick up these stylus' if you haven't already, they are really good!  Certainly worth replacing the plastic one considering the price.  Plus you get 3 of them in case you ever lose one.",5
Exactly what I needed to use the touch screen on a Alpha DC power rectifier. Also works with a JDSU T-Berd 8000.,4
I'm not one to complain much but I hate old products that get mixed in with the new. This is one I should have returned but missed my chance due to events happening. This was ordered by mistake. I'm sure it works just not for any of my devices.,1
"My new IIIXE came with a flimsy plastic stylus which was not particularly easy to grip or manipulate.  These replacement styli are plastic and brushed metal, prividing a much better grip and improved heft.",5
"So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three)  have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more  like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically  easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the  screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for  the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a  stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the  plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my  girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly  go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one,  buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!",5
"The original stylus that comes with the Palm IIIxe is a simple lightweight plastic device that you'll want to replace immediately. Simply put, this stylus three-pack is a bargain, and should be the first accessory item you add to a Palm IIIxe purchase. These have a metal barrel that makes it feel like a real writing instrument and not a toy.Put one in your IIIxe, one in your briefcase or purse, and maybe one in your car, and you'll always be covered. Read the other reviews here and you'll see that most of the owners agree - get this and you won't be sorry.",5
"The black molded plastic stylus that came with my Palm IIIxe was lightweight, functional ... and scratched my screen rather quickly, thanks to some excess flashing near the tip. These metal styli don't exhibit that problem. The extra weight also &quot;feels better&quot; in a way I can't describe otherwise. (It's not THAT much heavier, but it does feel more comfortable in your hand.) The best feature, though, is that unscrewing the top gets you to a built-in reset tool. Unfortunately, especially with third-party software, you WILL need to reset your Palm on occasion, and having a handy reset tool saves on batteries.",5
"You never know when you're going to need it. A good traveler always knows where his towel, err, stylus is at all times!",5
Not the same as the original.  Fits too small so had to put tape around it to make it fit.,3
"If you have a Palm, you're going to lose the stylus. If you're like me,  you're going to lose one about every four months. So you're going to need  replacements. If you haven't lost your original stylus yet, wait--you will.  Or, better yet, toss the original stylus in favor of one of the replacement  stylii. The cheap metal stylus that comes with the Palm III is hard to use  because it is too light. (I have carpal tunnel syndrome and found the  original equipment stylus aggravated it because of how hard I ended up  gripping the stylus.) These replacement stylii are a heavier metal, which  is easier to hold and considerably more accurate. Highly recommended.",5
"Trust me it does not work. I have tried it on all rooms, anddoes not transmit. Waste of money. If you want an item that does work I have found the SBC wireless to be the best and you can buy it at amazon or walmart.",1
I bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my DVR's require.  I've had no problems with this unit.,5
I purchased this product to provide phone connection to my DSS receiver. I do not have a phone line in that area and this seemed like a nice solution to the problem. This is a low data rate application and voice quality is clearly not of concern. The product was easy to install and worked perfectly for this application.,4
"I got this for a friend to use on his dial up modem, and it works flawlessley.Great buy.",5
"Used a Panasonic 2.4Ghz phones as the extension and it would not get a dial tone.  Plugged in a simple corded phone and it worked just fine.So, beware, the operation of the unit is uncertain.",2
"These worked OK for a while, then they died.  Reset button and repeated attempts to connect failed.Not recommended.",1
"This device did not work for me. They use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal. That electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers. In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours, so in my case it was very noisy making this adapters a total waist of money. I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me. But the device called DualJack could potentially interfere with other 2.4GHz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones, so far I have not had any interference. You have to try them and see what works for you. Joaquin Arosemena",1
"If you need to add a phone extension without cables or need to hook up a fax machine this product is ok, but for modems and internet connections, your speed will go dooooooown to 9600 or even less.",2
"Despite several attempts (including changing locations) I was unable to get a strong enough dial tone for my fax.I have seen that a real wireless 2.4 mgh phone extension system is available in Europe but not in the US, where I only find powerline systems.",1
"I purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom. Because of old wiring in the house, the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available. While I use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room, I needed a phone jack so my Tivo could dial out and get programming information. When set up, the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them. I purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that I could use it almost anywhere in my house. After a lot of effort, I find the unit to be nearly worthless.The range is VERY limited. I made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else (furniture, electronics, etc.) were in the way, yet there was no dial tone. I moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units, and I did get a dial tone, but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to. I couldn't imagine using it with an electronic device (like a modem or Tivo) that sends data. I got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within 15 to 20 feet of each other. Needless to say, with that kind of configuration, it's easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboard.",1
"The headline on this review says it all.  I'm not mechanically gifted in the least but this RCA Wireless Phone Jack did not test my technical acumen.  (Thank goodness).It's easy to set up, just click in a couple of leads, plug it in the wall and voila!, instant dial tone, good to go and Bob's your uncle.",5
"I installed this product and tried several A/C outlets,but the phone always produced backgound hiss and static.Within a week it quit working and I could not get the transmitter light to come on after that so returned the unit for a refund.  I got a different brand that does not have the background noise.  I hope it lasts.",2
"I use the RC926 to add an extra phone jack for my DirecTivos and standalone DirecTV receiver.  All three receivers are split off from the extension jack and I have never had a problem with the units making the required service data call.Edit: I also have DSL but use 2Wire filters (not the generic filters provided by Verizon) for greater clarity.  A filter has to be placed between the jack and the wireless BASE unit for the wireless extension unit to function properly with DSL.Note:  Tivos and DirecTivos DO HAVE MODEMS so Rios' title header is somewhat misleading. But the facts in the body of the review are correct. Per Page 10 of RCA's manual (which is available on their website): ""Note: The maximum baud rate for the Wireless Phone Jack is 14,400. Best results, however, will be experienced at 9,600.""  This limitation is why I knocked off a star.So yes, I would not recommend that you attempt to surf the Internet using this jack or use it for any purpose where a high baud rate is important.  But the phone jack is perfectly fine for voice, fax, and satellite receiver use.",4
"I used to have a second phone line in an upstairs room that I used primarily for faxing and occasional phone calls. When I got rid of that line, I bought this wireless phone jack so that I could use my main phone line in the upstairs room without paying the phone company the considerable cost of running new wires.The product does work even though the base station is connected to a phone jack in a room that is not only downstairs, but is also separated by multiple doors and walls from my upstairs room, which is in another part of the house.This unit has enabled me to use my phone/fax machine to send and receive faxes without any problems.  Making phone calls is a different story. Although there is always some ""noise"" on the line, sometimes it is so minimal that I can easily make a phone call and carry on a conversation. But other times the ""noise"" is so loud that it is not possible to use the phone to call someone.Bottom line: faxing is always possible, but voice conversations sometimes are not. You need to decide what your priorities are before you buy this.",3
"This is only the 2nd item I have returned in 6-8 yrs of buying on Amazon. It just doesn't work well enough to keep.You can make an outgoing call on it, but it will not ring for an incoming call. No Caller ID, no ring, no nothing. Outgoing call sound quality is terrible--static and clicking noises. I tried several different jacks, outlets and locations. I wanted to make sure the units weren't too close, nor too far from each other. Tried different jacks, plugs, etc. Made sure it was plugged directly into an outlet.Nothing made any difference. Outgoing call quality was poor, incoming would NEVER work nor ring. Returned item.",1
"This product does not have caller ID and makes a hissing sound that is irritating. I bought it from BuyAccessories, who weregreat with customer service and refunded my purchase. I will buy from them again. It's not their fault the product is mediocre.",2
this little gizmo works fine for most phones but it DOES NOT work with phones with caller ID.  Keep that in mind when you're considering a purchase.  Works great with the others.  Overall a nifty little device.,3
I bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my DVR's require.  I've had no problems with this unit.  This was an expansion for RCA RC926.,5
These RCA wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances.  Don't bother trying to use them for data such as with TiVo or a computer.  They simply won't work.  They use a fairly old technology and even basic phone conversation can result in interference from other devices in the house.,2

"This product does not work with my base unit at all, even though they are both the same brand.  Sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit. However, is RCA quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely don't work? Very inconvenient for customers. It also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w/ base units and extensions from the Amazon reviews I've read. Do your homework and I would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brand.",1
"This extension requires one of the following Wireless Phone Jack Systems: RCA RC 926, GE GE926 or D916.  (per packaging).  It does NOT work with the RCA RC 930, which Amazon is bundling with it.  Don't buy it with the RC 930!",1
"Excellent product while it lasts.  I have yet to have one of these last for more than four months.  I usually purchase a few at time so that I always have a spare for when ever it no longer works.  Because the telephone is so uncomfortable to hold, a handset is a necessity and this is the best one to have.  Unfortunately, it does not last for too long.",3
I've owned several of these items and all were inferior and really useless. This unit fits well and the sound quality I hear is superb. I've asked those I've talked with how they hear me and they say it is also loud and clear. Guess I'd have to give it a total of five stars.,5
"I used it once and my sister long distance couldn't even tell. I have used Plantronics plastic tube-type microphones at work and the sound quality was better the sister said.It was weird to have a very lightweight headset on my head -- instead of a phone clenched between my head and shoulder. But! I knew it was something I could learn to love quickly.The mike was not quite long enough however... call me a big mouth! It didn't reach around in front of my face. It was very much to the side. Just in the peripheral vision... again something I was sure I could get accustomed to.But. The next time I plugged it in, if I touched the cord or the phone or moved there was massive crackling. I gave up after a few more tries. I should of sent it back (Amazon is SUPER about replacing items) but didn't really think about it until the warranty had expired.I am ready to try again. But this time will read all the reviews before purchasing.",1
There appears to be an engineering flaw in the plug connection for the microphone wire.  I have two of these units where you can hear the caller but they cant hear you.  This is too bad because the sound quality is very good for the price.,1
The only thing it was missing is the volume slider with mute button. I had it on the previous Uniden headset. Otherwise it works great and I am happy with the 3 I bought.,4
Headset is comfortable and works well. I can still get things done around the house while talking on the phone and this is a great help.  Only drawback is that microphone is mounted on plastic mouth piece and this limits adjustability for the distance from mouth to microphone.,4
This is a great headset.  The volume is just a little lower than I would have expected but overall I am very happy with this headset and I would buy another if I had the need.,5
"I decided I wanted a headset so that I could talk on the phone while doing work or cooking around my house.  I looked at both this Uniden headset and  the AT&amp;T one that is also sold on Amazon.  Even though I read the  reviews on here that said this headset can easily break I went ahead and  bought one for cheap off the Amazon.com Outlet.  I used it for a few months  and was pretty happy with it.  It was comfortable on my head, easy to  adjust, sounded good, and I never got any complaints from people I was  talking to.Then it broke.So now I'm about to shell out some more  money for the AT&amp;T headset and I figured I'd share my new found wisdom  with everyone else.",2
"I purchased this for my wife to use when she speaks to a certain someone each night and puts the phone on the speaker system.  The only probem is that my wife wears one of these all day and was not happy to wear this at home.  I used it a few time when I work on my computer and need help.  Sound quality is fine.  If I had to do over, I might have looked into a wireless. Don't get me wrong, it works fine. It's that I don't really need it with my speaker phones.",4
"This is the worst headset I have ever owned. I bought so many of them over the years I don't remember anymore how many went bad. At least 10. The reason I keep buying them is because all other manufacturer headsets don't work well with a Uniden cordless phone. Uniden requires a specific impedance, otherwise voice quality is not good.Calling Uniden is worthless. They are of no help.I actually think they design the tip of the connector to break because each one has stopped working properly where the wire connects to the 2.5mm plug.I'm not buying anymore Uniden phones or headsets.",1
This is the 5th wireless phone jack I have purchased.  It worked for maybe 2 months then died.  Tried to reset but it would not connect. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,1
Used this for all of about 5 minutes.  Couldn't connect at all.  Gave one star only because I couldn't give 0.,1
Unfortunately this wireless modem jack had a substantial amount of line noise.  I was able to connect to the internet at 1/10th the normal speed due to the insufficient connection.  I will give this to another family member to try in a newer house.,1
"I read the reviews about how there's too much static when used on a phone line...I wouldn't know. I only bought this thing to get a credit on my DISH network bill. (They don't tell you they charge per month if you don't have it plugged into a phone line, just that you get a credit each month if you do.) For one year, it doesn't pay, but for a 2-YR contract, it pays itself off after the first year. So, since I didn't have any phone lines anywhere near by, this thing works just fine for what I need.",5
"This worked well to transfer a caller ID signal to an area where I have a cable box and TV.  This was very good for my needs, but I did listen to the line and it was noisy when using some outlets.  I also had a tough time finding two different outlets that would ""talk"" to each other and transfer the caller ID signal; but after a lot of trial and error it seems to work flawlessly.",4
"I've used the RCA RC930 Wireless Modem Jacks to create a poor man's wireless network in my home.  It works!  And I love it!  I can now sit in any chair of my house, surf the web, and print (across the room) to my wireless HP 995 Bluetooth printer.My system consists of two sets of RCA Wireless Modem Jacks (a sender and receiver unit in each set) -- one set for the upstairs and one set for the downstairs (which appear to be on separate circuits and are not connected); a 3Com Bluetooth PC card for my laptop; and a HP 995 Bluetooth printer.I now use my laptop in the following manner: first, I plug the RCA receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where I want to sit; then I turn on the printer; and finally, I extend the little blue tooth-shaped antenna (how cute!) on the laptop's PC card -- and I'm all set to go!The RCA Modem Jack is good up to 56k, which is ok since I don't have internet cable or DSL service in my area.  But I'll gladly trade-off mobility for speed any day.  Here's why.My desktop computers (old and new) are in my upstairs bedrooms -- where I can't use them when my family is sleeping.  They are also far away from where my family spends most of its time -- and that's downstairs by the TV's.With the RCA wireless modem jacks, I can now access the internet --- while watching TV with my family; and I can surf the net long after everyone has gone to sleep -- when internet speeds are fastest.  The connection is fairly clean (free of static); and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if I had accessed the phone jack directly.I've gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net. When cable or DSL eventually come to my neighborhood, I guess I'll have to set up a wireless network in my home (for a lot more money) -- in order to maintain my mobility.Until then, I'll use the next best thing -- RCA's Wireless Modem Jacks.  They're great!",5
"the people who rated this highly only used it for Tivo...I have vonage and i wanted this to put my telephone in a place different than where my vonage router is in my apartment and it works HORRIBLY.i spent over an hour trying multiple different connections and distances and came to the conclution that the only way it works is if they receiver is in the same jack as the sending device.  SO DISAPPOINTED!!!i got it for $35 so im not that mad, but still i paid for something i should not have bought in the first place..",1
"Had a small setup problem (I needed to do the security setup before it would let me hear a dialtone), otherwise I use it on my tivo and it works just fine (so far).Update (several years later). This unit is really lousy. I called tivo for an unrelated issue one day, and the guy on the phone said ""you're using one of those wireless modem things aren't you"" - he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir. I didn't know because the tivo managed to mask the failures, but after trying several online tivo updates, I got to finding out how much this really doesn't work. I have a series 2 tivo now and am using an 802.11 network which is infinitely better and faster.",4
"It was difficult to set up, and it does NOT work with the RC920 extension that Amazon is combining with it, but it does ultimately work.",3
"I made the mistake of buying the RCA Wireless Phone Jack to connect my TIVO downstairs in the living room where I don't have a jack.  It did not work.  Once I finally re-read what I needed, I bought the RCA Wireless Modem Jack.  It works perfectly and I haven't had any problems.",5
I bought this for a spare bedroom where we did not have a telephone jack. Installation was a snap and it works great. Sound quality is awesome and in addition you can use it to connect an access point router to expand the reach of your Wi-Fi network.,5
"The wireless modem/phone jack idea is a great one, but it rarely works the way it is intended.  Whether it's interference from other electronics, old house wiring, or any number of things, it tends to have a poor signal resulting in a bad connection.  If you're using this for either a modem, security system that requires a phone line, or a telephone jack, it's likely not going to give you the results you want.  My recommendation would be to go ahead and have a phone drop and jack installed and call it a day.  It may be a more expensive option, but it's by far the best one.",2
"I tried this to use a fax two floors above my Vonage phone modem with fax outlet and performance was very spotty.  Sometimes it worked, but many times I'd get a ""poor line condition"" error message when I tried to fax.I finally broke down and ran telephone wire to that room through the walls.  It was a pain, but I finally got my fax to work all the time.",2
"I have used this wireless phone jack system to connect a DirecTV receiver for over 18 months (and for three months, a Tivo) without a problem.  The stations are about 20 feet apart with a wall and furniture in between, but I have not had connectivity issues.  I have two wireless networks (b and g)in the same area and have not had the interference problems others have mentioned.  That said, my parents tried using the same system in their home and got lots of static and dropped modem connections over a 15 ft. line-of-sight installation with no other wireless networks, so the system seems to be somewhat picky.",4
"I'm shopping around for wireless speakers to use in a conference room at work so that I can pull in a few folks attending by teleconference.I'm sorry, but I just don't think there's any way I could set this up on my conference table without some of my colleagues having to work very hard to conceal a grin, or even a snicker.The problem, to put it delicately, is that the antenna is, well, er, it's um, kinda... WELL, JUST LOOK AT IT!  A possible distraction.",3
Works ok. Not worth the price tag new. I purchased refurb for half the price of new. Sounds is not CD quality. Sound is similar to FM radio as the device broadcasts over a FM signal. I live in a condo and placed 1 speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room. Now I can listen to my Comcast Music Choice and CDs thru out my home.,2
"I purchased these speakers about a year ago. If you'd like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example. I'm on Amazon right now buying replacements (ANOTHER BRAND) for these that have completely failed. They worked fine at first, then got fuzzier. One quit completely tonight, no power..nothing. The other still ""works"" with lots of fuzz. I find myself re-tuning the signal a lot. Time for a replacement. If you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand. I'm trying the Acoustic Research AW-871s now. They supposedly have better range. Don't settle for cheap unless you have to. You'll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long! Don't say we didn't warn you!",2
I got these for Christmas one year and had a really difficult getting good sound out of them. I wanted to use them for my PC to play music around the house. At first I would get very soft sound and sometimes no sound at all. I shelved them for a while and then decided to try them on my PC again with a Soundblaster 16 sound card. Excellent sound. These speakers are not for the impatient person. I do have the transmitter sitting on the top floor on a high shelf so that it can get go transmission. The transmitter can not be surrounded by anything. I can get a good 100 ft out of the speakers. Then I start losing signal. There are times that I get a beeping sound of them. For some reason that does subside. I do recommend them for the price. Beware it might take some time to find the right niche for them.,3
"I bought two and use them in different parts of the house to listen to my Sirius Satelite radio. I can walk around the house and listen to either Howard or the Rolling Stones channel through out, using one boom box.There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get full use of these.* A) * Set the volume going into the transmiter higher. 2) Low volume in will cause popping and fading. Very low volume in will for some reason cause the transmitter to shut down. 2) Higher volume in will allow you to lower the preamp volume on the speakers and play with less distortion and lower noise level. When you increase the volume on the speakers, you are amplifying the NOISE as well as the music. Makes sense, right?B) The power cord is also part of the antenna, so its location and position can be adjusted to improve reception. I used little plastic wire ties to afix the cord to speaker stands. The cord runs straight down like a verticle antenna.C) The speaker is still a radio reciever and subject to interferrence. You can adjust the frequency on the transmitter and on the recievers (speakers). Fine tune them for the best reception in your location. This may take a few adjustsments. Remember, cellphones, WIFI etc can all interfere!I tried plugging the transmitter into my stereo's headset jack, but it didn't work well, because the output was too low. I'm going to cut the plugs off of the Y adapter or make an adapter with bare wires and try using them as the rear (effects) channel of my home theater.I love these speakers and use them everyday. They could be a little better, but I still love them! I'd give them 5 stars if they were a little louder, a little better tone wise and the reception range was a little better. You'd get 150' in an open feild or gymnasium, not my odd shaped house. But for the money, they are a great VALUE!My house is made concrete & steel and has metalic tinted glass all over, so wireless stuff doesn't work the greatest. With my windows closed & the tranmitter on my patio, I get about 30' with occaisional drift. Your house might be better. I'm going to buy another pair because I see that they are discontinued and these sound better than the newer ones. I'm also concerned that the new ones may have differnt frequencies, which is a good thing if you want to use more than one pair at a time, connected to different inputs.Better hurry up and buy now, before I get buy all!",4
Liked the reception of this vs. the Garmin unit I had previously. But soon learned that maps are the way to go. I upgraded to a Map330 soon after trying the 315.,3
"Having spent 2 hours with the Magellan 315 on a camping weekend in Arizona's mountains, I can say that the unit is all that's advertised. The manual is cryptic, but once you get used to the customizing menus and 9 available navigation screens, the rest is pretty intuitive. I was able to create a waypoint, walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within 20 feet. It works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest. It was showing an estimated RMS positional error of only 6 feet at one point! Routes are given in 1. foot increments when you are within .1 miles of your waypoint (with the updated software you can download from the Magellan website)! As long as you keep moving, the compass feature is quite good. It even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial.Nice screen, plenty of options and quite accurate. When used in your car, it tracks your speed to .1 mph, with updates given each second.  If you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover, this is a nice addition. I suspect on an open lake, this would be super for locating favorite fishing spots.",4
"I have had my GPS for about a year now, and love it, but i have 2 problems with it, the interface is very difficult to use and tedious to search for a city or road.  By the time i find the place im trying to get ive passed it and gone another 20 miles.  Also, mine was working fine when suddenly one day i turned it on and it said it had no maps and i needed a upload.  So i downloaded the latest patch for it, and tried uploading with no success.  I have gotten a number from Magellan to return it, but lost the number (actually my dad did) So im returning it :(  but i must say it was great while it worked, and the tech support is fast and reliable.",5
"This is my first GPS unit and I could not be more pleased.  It is simple to use and easy to carry.  I have used it to mark Civil War battle sites and to find bench marks.  It takes me right to the bench marks.  If you are looking for a good unit, the 315 is the one you are looking for.",5
"Screen small...hard to read while driving.Battery eater. I use the DC adapter, however.No maps.Not enough contrast on screen. With sunglasses while driving, can't see screen.Tiny print on &quot;Goto&quot; destination. Impossible to read while driving.Good, quick operation once you learn it..Does everything it says it will.I like it except for the above things....",4
"I purchased the GPS 315 in December after using another brand for five years. The GPS315 represents a big improvement with better, quicker satelite acquistion, a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user  to use the sun or moon to  correct bearing. This way the user is not having  to pull out a compass to check bearing. Additional pluses are its small  size and light weight using only two AA batteries lasting up to 15 hours.  If weight is a concern, that is big. My previous unit used four and lasted  five hours. Problems: The manual is as sorry as it can get. It barely  covers TrackRoute, Track History, Backtrack, and Reverse Route. These are  major important features left to the user to figure out. I have yet to  figure them out consistently. With Track History there seems to be an  ability to set a scale, but what scale? Nothing tells me. Is it how often  it records a waypoint in history?I have emailed the company with  questions twice, called once (had to leave a voice mail because they were  not taking calls), faxed once. Heard nothing from their customer  no-service. I wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts. Oh yes, my GPS  315 crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old.  Glad I wasn't in the middle of 40,000 acres. You can't zoom in on a  waypoint if it is very far away from your current location. Actually to do  so but you have to set a scale of .1 or .2 and Pan &amp; Scan to it. If is  is 50 miles away, you can imagine how long that could take.",3
"This kit is absolutely horrible.First off, the scratch-free cloths it comes with aren't scratch-free at all. They totally scratch the CD.The ""Step 1: Scratch Removal"" is not scratch removal at all. It is supposed to sit for 5 minutes, then you wipe it. I let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still there.After you apply that junk, the instructions say to apply ""Step 2: Cleaner,Polisher, and Sealer"". This stuff is practically water. It doesn't work AT ALL.After you do that the CD should be like new. I don't think so!The holder that you put the CD on while you're cleaning it is too flimsy.The only good thing that I use the ""Scratch Remover"" for is small scratches on my digital camera, cell phone, PSP, and other electronics.Do not buy this unless you like ruining CD's.Last Word:I hate Maxell.",1
"After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the ""protective"" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.",1
"I have a couple DVDs that had relatively small scratches on them, but deep enough to stop playback and I was able to get them to work correctly.  It did take a couple applications, but the sections where the DVD would stop and shut off, now play continuously through.  Make sure to follow the directions and wipe as the instructions say and the disc will work fine after everything dries.",5
"I bought this repair kit so I could watch a rental movie.  It had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts.  After I was done, I had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before.",1
I bought 2 of these kits hoping they would work.  I have found them absolutely useless at $10+ per kit.  I will continue to search for a product/system that REALLY works.,1
"Been using this stuff for a couple years.  Works great for me. I use it different than the instruction.  Find a flat surface, lay a bundle of tissue on it, place the disk scratched face up.  Place a couple drops of #1 abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward (you don't have to wait 5 minutes).  Keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry (about 5 minutes).  Spray once with #2, and using a clean TISSUE, continue wiping VERY GENTLY radially outward until #2 dries.  Try the disk.  If it doesn't work, repeat all the above until it does.  This really does work, but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches.  I've had a LOT of scratched disks, and I haven't found one yet that I couldn't fix with this.",5
"This product is crap. I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail (I am a very methodical person) and it didn't remove the scratch that my DVD has and it added several more. I read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions, but I am not willing to do that; the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work. Following the instructions, it ruins your CD or DVD even further. Don't wast you time, money and your CD / DVD and take it somewhere where they can buff it.",1
Bought these for a long airplane ride. They worked pretty well for a few days but then the right side went out. That seems to be pretty common with this set. Also the battery compartment is in the cord and in a really awkward position where it hangs free and pulls on the headphones on one side.,1
"I bought 4 prs of these about 6 years ago for an extended trip. 6 plane rides later, we were all happy with the purchase. I don't think the stewardesses were happy that we didn't have to buy headphones though... but, they worked well and we were able to hear the in-flight movie and the movies on our portable DVD players. 4 stars because they are a little flimsy and some of them broke with more rugged use when we got home. However, two pair are still functioning quite well. Saw these at this reduced price and I just bought 5 more pair for some travelling this Summer. I don't get into all the techie stuff that others do... I just say if it works well, great...",4
"I got these headphones long time ago and still enjoy them! They are so good - you just listen to your music and nothing else outside. They have few jacks to fit to different systems, so it can be universal to many audio electronics. Also it stratches somewhat, so it can fit to different sizes of head.",5
"I really like these and they do cut out the noise, only one thing I don't care for id the piece that hangs on the cord. It holds batteries in it so the batteries of your player can last longer in energy.Nice idea but awkward in use. It is heavy in weight and in a bad spot. This little box should have been higher up towards the head instead of the middle of the cord. However it is a nice headphone and studioquality.",5
"These were great at first purchase, but they did not hold up very well. They were used only inside the home and handled carefully.  One side speaker went and then a few months later, the other one stopped as well.  They lasted less than one year.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.We opted INSTEAD for PHILLIPS O'NEILL SHO9561/28.  These are extremely comfortable around your head, noise-reducing, fab sound.",2
"Very nice.  I used them as wireless headphones for quite some time before finding myself in a situation where I needed a headset and microphone combination.  I remembered that these had that feature - it was not one I could figure out on my own though, I did need to reference the directions as to where to plug everything in at, but maybe that's just me.  Anyway, once they were all set, they functioned wonderfully!",5
"While these are ok sounding, they have a feature that makes them one I use often. I bought these cheap. They offer pretty decent noise cancelling, for cutting the lawn. Also, they come in handy for when I'm at workCounting beats and mixing, these headphones with the noise reduction, make it so much better to dial in.As everyday headphones the sound and it's delicate wired nature, may turn some people off.They are somewhat comfortable, battery life is great, and comes with a carrying bad. No quarter inch adapter,not too many people need it anymore.All in all, a bit delicate, wires can become weak at junctions.They do what I want them to do, so I buy a couple and keep a pair as backup for gig.I own Grado, too bright, Beyerdynamic, my favorite set, and briefly had Bose, way too pricey, and nowhere near neutral in sound.If they were more durable, I would rate them higher.If you're careful with them and want cheap noise cancelling headphones, they are worth it.",3
"There is a slight reduction in regular, low-frequency noise as in air travel, but these are not nearly as effective as Bose or Audio-Technica.",2
"I had these for only a few weeks and they have quit working entirely.  Fiddling with the cord doesn't help.  For $50, I expected much better quality.  I am sadly disappointed and will not buy any headphone that says ""Maxell"" again - you can't trust anybody these days, they've all gone for cheap and to heck with quality.",1
"I previously had a pair of Sony noise-cancellers.  The big downfall of the Maxells are the battery pack.  It's about half-way down the cord.  If you use them at a desk and move much, you'll constantly pull the pack off of the desk and it'll fall with a sharp jerk to your headphones.  The Sonys only used a single AAA battery but the Maxells use two.  So, Sony was able to put it in a compartment on the headphone band with no aggravation.  Oddly, the Sonys seem to have much better battery life for me.  The Maxells do enclose the ears much better to help block sounds, but they do start to hurt your ears after prolonged use.  If you wear them for hours at a time, the similarly priced Sonys are easier on the ear.  I'm not wild about the way the Maxells fold up, either.  The Sonys kind of spin in and make for much flatter storage.  Another problem with the Maxells is a loud creaking sound from the plastic.  Often just moving your jaw seems to produce a loud plastic-on-plastic noise that comes through quite loud.  With a slight re-design, Maxell could have a nice set of headphones.  Wait until then or try another brand.",2
"This is an awesome laptop for its price. Only one complaint, as others have mentioned, problems with the power jack. Within a month, it got loose and had to keep jiggling it to get it charging. Took it back to the store I got it, and they gave me a brand new one one the spot. But, several months later, the new one had the same problem. Brought it back again. This time I had to wait 2 weeks to get it repaired. Two months later, same problem. Another 2 week repair. I'm striving to not move it at all while it is plugged in, but heck, it's a laptop! Anyway, if it happens a fourth time, my warranty says they have to give me a new one.",4
"The sound quality is good, the fit comfy and the close-fitting cups make for good sound isolation even without the NR on.  When you turn on the NR, though, you'll hear that annoying jet engine hiss disappear into a faint background hum.YES.  I don't even listen to music with these.  I put them on, turn them on and then just SLEEP for the flight.AWESOME.",4
These headphones were disappointing. I bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger AC unit. These headphones do a good job of reducing the low-frequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through. As a result the noise reduction for me was about 20 - 30% of the total. I also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results. They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums.,2
"Ive had the Maxell NC II over a couple of years & they are still holding up well.I now use these headphones primarily at home to relax in the recliner while listening to music or taking an undisturbed nap.I originally got them because I was a long haul truck driver & the engine & wind noise was just wearing me out not to mention having to turn the radio up too loud just to hear it.These headphones helped to stop that.The noise canceling feature is effective in reducing the ambient noise around me creating a much more relaxed, stress free environment.At the end of the day I wasnt nearly as tired as when I didnt use the headphones.Im not an audiophile so I cant give you stats & freq #s but I enjoy my music, books on tape & movies more using these headphones.I also like the collapsible, over the ear design. They are comfortable & I havent had any problems with them getting hot after wearing them over an extended time.The battery life is very good, the electrical cord is a good length & the on/off switch is sturdy with a small green light when on.Im going to upgrade to the NC IV for home & keep my NC II for in the car.",4
"I got these headphones in June. By August the sound in one ear was cutting out. I could move the wire and get it back temporarily. Fine, if you don't move your head. Now it's October and the sound in that ear is gone for good. That good price for noise cancelling headphones, isn't so great for only 5 months. Guess they are meant to be disposable.Don't waste your money!",1
"I purchased these headphones before traveling to Europe for a couple weeks and the headphones worked great.  The sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice.  The battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains.  I used it on both flights with great relaxation and I also used it on the Chunnel and some subways with continued satisfaction.The weight, length of cord, and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling.Unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable.  They are made of plastic and feel very fragile.  I was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch.  But worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up.In other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design.  After only about a month, one of the wires split and I lost the right headphone completely.  And forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casing.I am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again.  If not for the poor design these would have been great headphones for the price.",2
"I've never felt a need for noise cancellation headphones, but I received these as a gift. Fortunately, no one spent a lot of money on them, because they really seem cheap to me. The construction is flimsy, and they're bulky. Maxell might as well have included a paper sack to carry them in, as the bag that comes with them is not much more than that. It offers no protection to the headphones at all.I just can't see packing this kind of bulk in my scarce carry-on space. I don't see any payoff for the bulk in terms of the sound that you get: these simply sound quite mediocre with the noise cancellation off. With noise cancellation on, the sound is even worse. It's flat and lifeless.I had recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser PX-100s. They sound vastly better for the money. They fold down super-compactly into a nicely-designed case and even cost a few bucks less.I don't know about the expensive noise-cancellation headphones, but I would rather have a better pair of regular headphones for this price.",2
"I am not an audiophile, but I do care about the sound I hear. I bought this headset last week mainly for the time I spend removing snow in winter. I wanted a headset that covers my ears well, while sounding OK. I thought this noise cancelling phone would be a great choice, especially because my snowblower is terribly loud. Well, it does cover my ears comfortably well, but unfortunately thats all that is good about this headset. It isnt particularly great sounding, and the biggest disappointment was noise cancellation - rather the lack of it. It is hard to perceive much difference between NC being on or off!! It does suppress some, so I know it is on, but it can hardly suppress anything real. I quickly gave up any hope about its use with snowblower, but I then found it cant do much about the sound of my home's furnace as well - which is barely audible even without a headset.. bummer.I have a Sony MDR-NC6 that I have been using for the past 2 years or so. It still works great, just that it doesnt have a cupped headset to cover my ear. If that is not one of your criteria, I highly recommend it. It sounds way better, is cheaper (at least now it is), noise cancellation works great too. See my review there.",2
These cassette tapes work well for my needs.I use them for lectures and not for music.I'm happy that they are still available.,5
"I have used Maxell Cassettes for over 30 years and never have been disappointed.  If you ar an audio purist, don't purchase this, go for the higher bias.  For normal folk like me with tin-pan ears, this product carries audio to near perfection and at a real bargain price, whether that price is retail or sale.",5
"it's funny to appreciate a source for these tapes, but I do.  I may be old fashioned, but I still like using my cassette player and tapes.",5
"I immediately passed this link to friends still using Magnetic Cassette tapes. They are getting harder to locate and this brand, length and packaging are excellent. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. I might add that the box looked like it had a hard shipping experience. No damage to tapes, or their plastic cases.",5
"I ordered micro cassettes and got these, I was angered by the miscommunication and went with another seller, got exactly what I wanted so I am happy. I did not try these out. I don't have a standard cassette recorder.",1
"Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape, as one reviewer correctly notes, make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of $6.75 for the fifteen-pack you spend roughly 45 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XL-II; but it's still not the same as a digitized CD-R recording. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.",4
"So I acutally bought these tapes for an art project and I am not going to be ""using"" these at all.  I don't even have a tape player anymore.Both projects are lamps made out of either just the cassette tapes or the tapes in their cases.  Thought I would give both a try and see which I liked better.I really like the first one better, I bought different kinds of lights to try out inside the base.I have also seen people spray paint these neon colors and hang them from string in rooms, put on walls.  Fun art to remember a cool time when you rewound tapes with pencils so you didn't waste batteries. :P",5
"I needed to buy cassettes elsewhere than where I was buying them from.  They were getting more expensive each and every year.  Luckily I thought about looking here.  I found cassettes at a price from a period of many years ago.  It literally brought back childhood memories, well not really, but it was very inexpensive.  I still like recording on my old cassette player but found many stores not carrying cassettes on their shelves.  And when they did, the prices were high.  I highly recommend purchasing cassettes here on Amazon, they have many different brands to chose from.",5
"All right, I did not time the recording to make sure I actually got 45 minutes on each side, but the tape snapped into place securely, and I recorded from one end to the other without it tangling inside the recorder. When I played it back, it played back smoothly with no skips or tangles. I have used three or four of them without a hitch, but then I generally do rely on Maxell for my taping needs so I was not surprised. I will buy more again when I need more.",5
"I always order these cassettes online. Although people now use CD's, I give a taped session to my clients as a courtesy so I don't have to deal with burning CD's. Buying online is less expensive and easier to find. Saves me the trouble of locating a store that still carries them. Usually one Walgreen's that I know of has them but its hit or miss.",5
"Recently found a really great Onkyo 3-head, 3-motor cassette deck for playing my old cassettes from years ago - for low dollars.  This is the best price I've seen on good normal bias tapes - the chrome (high bias, Type II) are just too pricey - but these sound just fine for all my music, whether rock, jazz, country or classical.  Getcha some before the Type I prices get stupid, too.  And enjoy some George Jones singing along with a Beethoven tune while David Sanborn blows his sax and Jimmy Page picks his axe.",5
"if you love to record music from cd's or the radio, & dont want to pay an arm & a leg for good quality tapes, these are for you!  i have bought 3 '15' count packages of them so far. im very happy. i intend to buy more.",5
"SO FAR, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE THESE CASSETTES OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH NO PROBLEMS IN THE QUALITY OF SOUND PRODUCED BY THEM, I REALLY ENJOY THE BLANK TAPES AS I AM ABLE TO DO WHAT I NEED TO GET DONE, NO PROBLEMS.",4
I just wrote a review on 160 Maxell tapes (3 pack).  This 4 pack  of 120 minute is a good buy of fine quality reliable blank tapes.,5
"Two relatives still have multiple VCRs and they tape a lot of stuff.  Tapes wear out over time so I buy them new tapes once a year or so.  These tapes are a very good price and last for a long time even though my Mom and aunt tape over them maybe hundreds of times in a year.  I have never gotten a ""bad"" tape or had tapes break.",5
If you have an old VCR that still works and you enjoy taping your TV shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes. This will more than likely become even harder.  We located these on Amazon. They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find. These Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic.,5
The package arrived in about 6 days and in the advertised condition. I've bought Maxell products in the past(especially cassette audio tapes and vhs tapes) and have never been disappointed. The color and sound are both exceptional on these tapes. I know that the trend is changing and these tapes are going the way of the 8-track (and I'm trying to slowly make the change over to digital media) but in the meanwhile..I can highly recommend this Maxell 4-pk for your vcr recording needs.Also-this vendor appears to be a fine one.,5
I needed some new VHS tapes and these fit the bill perfectly. They have been working well and I'm very pleased with them. Amazon has really good prices on everything anyway so I knew I would find a really good deal and I did!,5
"there's not much choice for vhs tapes now, I'm happy I can still find them on Amazon. I would give this a better rating if one of the tapes hadn't had a broken piece internally, I could hear it rattling and when I took the tape apart there was a piece snapped off. but they were cheap enough that I didn't bother to return the package.",3
"These are really nice tapes, they record well the first time and re-record over and over. Still have a vcr to record tv occasionally and these work well",4
I have used these VHS Tapes before and the quality is great each time.  I will buy these the next time for making copies.  Darryl,5
"If you still use a VCR, these Maxell video tapes are a good quality. I have used them both for everyday recording of television shows and a one-time use for recording a movie I want to keep.",5
"Great price and delivery. We cannot often stay up later to watch a favorite show, so we tape it and are able to watch it later. Maxell makes a good product that lasts.",5
"I have used Maxwell for some time. I liked the price and having used these in the past, you can retape over them many, many times. I use them to tape television shows on air after my bedtime. You get good, clear pictures even after several months of taping. I would reorder these again. Also, there are few, if any, places locally to purchase any brand of VHS tapes.",4
"Practical and affordable, as usual. That's the &#34;maxell&#34; brand.It still gives you quality & integrity with each and every product.",5
"I use these tapes because unfortunately I still live in the 20th Century, and still enjoy taping movies. One day, I will order a DVR, but for the time being, these tapes are great!",5
"It's nice to know the possibility is there to find them. With them and VCR players (next thng I,ll be looking for.",5
"We bought a VCR for nostalgic reasons.  We, like everyone else, got rid of our VCR back when we made the transition to DVD, but in the last couple years we longed for a bit of nostalgia, so we bought a VCR, some tapes and these blank tapes to re-experience what it was like watching VHS as kids. These are good tapes. They play well.",5
"VHS tapes, got them for my grandma, I'm sure they allow her to record the price is right without any trouble.",3
"Of course this is a great, great buy... you don't have to pay a lot for quality VHS tapes anymore so we didn't. We got a bargain.",5
"They are hard to find these days. I still prefer my VCR to DVD because I simply do not want to keep 90% of what I record and VCR is still the best way to go. DVDs are too expensive and I do not use cable or satellite or things like that. I get over 100 digital channels with my rabbit ears  and have very little time to actually watch TV, so I still rely on my good old VCR/DVD recorder to help me eventually view shows I want to see -- when I get the time.",5
"Currently I'm moving some family memories from older VHS tapes to DVD-Ram and ripping them to a digital format on my PC.  Since these are important memories, I want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto 'fresh' VHS tapes is something important to me.  Comparing these tapes to local price, the price here on Amazon is very competitive.  After recording older footage onto these VHS tapes, I'm quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the SP record setting.  Not much has changed in the VHS tape since it has become such a dinosaur, but it's great to be able to get this product when you need it, for a reasonable price.",5
"I still use videotapes for easy, uncomplicated recording of things I don't plan on keeping indefinitely.  I've used two tapes from the pack I bought and they are just fine.  No problems so far.  Am rating 4 rather than 5 only because I haven't been using them long, and I haven't done much re-recording, which is something else I do.  I may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy them!",4
"The answer is me hahaYup I am living in the 80's. I have three vcr's that and still enjoy watching or buying discount vcr movies or old ones I have filmed. And yes, guilty as charged, I still use them to tape shows I have missed. This is a good value for the 4 pack and I tape over them after watching whatever I have taped and so far no issues. I think you can tape over about 30 times before the quality starts dropping",4
"This was fantastic, you see my husband and I have a unit that requires VCR tape and we tape our soap operas and this is the only way we can get them. Stores just don't have what we are looking for",5
"I admit I still use a VCR, & probably will forever, just seems to work better for me.  These are hard to find these days, so glad you can get here & the price is good. It's a quality item as I use these over & over & they never give me problems.",5
"Years ago I would be able to buy VHS tapes in just about every store.  Not they are harder to find, and when you do find them they are expensive.  Here I was able to buy VHS tapes for under $2.  Not only did I find my type of VHS tapes, but found other types as well such as PRO tapes, etc...  I plan on purchasing other types of cassettes in the near future, only because it is affordable and convenient to buy.  I also like the fact that they are delivered to your home at no extra cost.  I highly recommend buying VHS tapes here, I have purchased over 50 tapes so far and all recorded perfectly.",5
"These do the job expected. No problems with recording or playing.It seems VHS tapes are being phased out, at least I can't find them in local stores anymore.These do at least as well as what I've used in the past.",5
The price was right and the quality is what you'd expect on a vhs. I am using these to record mini-dv films and would recommend,5
Maxell is a well trusted brand that has quality products. Bought these because I still use a video recorder. Have never had any problems with them and am sorry to see them go.,4
A couple of the tapes required break in and I suggest a fast forward and rewind before you start recording. I have DMRs and record TV shows on EP mode. Both sound and video are good even on a 60&#34; 3-D Plasma and 350w sound system.,5
Very happy with this product.  It arrived in record time and the tapes work well with my VCR's. Would recommend to otheres that are still using VCR's.,5
I like to tape a lot on my vcr and this is a quite reliable product.  I will continue to purchase these.,5
These VHS tapes are good but after I got them I realized that I needed more time but this was no fault of the Manufacturer and since they are no longer available it does not matter now.I have found them at another website with more hours.  Now I just have to remember how to use them to my advantage.,4
Excellent 4-pack of tapes. Been buying Maxwell for years now and never have had any problem's or been unhappy at all!,4
"Had them shipped directly to my brother on the other side of the state.  He is a little &#34;old fashion&#34; and still records on tape.He tells me that the quality of his recorded material plays back great, especially the football games.",5
I bought these to use with my vcr little did i know my hdtv will not accept my on air vcr lol so now even though its a great buy...im going to use this some other time i'm glad i bought it though.,5
"Good tapes that can be recorded many times and are easy to remove from box. If you still use tapes, use these!!!",4
"use in older security systems , works fine, life expectancy  used  1 night a week about 1-2 years, getting hard to find now that everything is digitalEdit 3/10/2013some of the tapes refues to rewidn completely, one after only a few days use, some kind of internal binding? one screeches liek a banshee on rewind but works fine, 1 broke.so far 3 of 6 work ok , 1 works poorly, 1 fights rewind , 1trashed in can.lower review to a 3",3
"I have found Maxell to be one of the reliable VHS tapes.  (Sony and TDK I have always found good too.) For those who don't know, the 160 minute uses thinner tape in order to get it on the same reel as a 120.  When tape is thinner there is more possibility for the layers to stick to each other by static electricity. Therefore I don't recommend 160 for repeated reusing but for some long thing, or somethings adding up to 8 hours (at SP) to save and watch sometime.  The 120s I use and reuse a lot, and keep a lot too.  :-)  Long may the VCR's survive.P.S.  oooops! Made an error above.  I said 8 hrs. at SP. Of course, we all know SP is the fastest. LP or SLP - whichever your VCR has as slowest is what I meant. Fast speed recording is considered best by some. Pause at SP gives a jerky picture. At SLP you can pause and get a quite steady look at a particular shot, and the overall clarity and quality of the recording I consider quite OK.",5
These are wonderful for recording anything you like if you still have a VCR!  I will use them and order more!,5
I bought this pack specifically because each tape is 8 hrs long. This length is useful for recording sports programs especially that tend to run pretty long.The quality of the picture is still pretty good even at 8 hrs. So far I have had no problems with these tapes. I suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noise.I got these at a good price(just under seven bucks) on Amazon. VHS tapes are difficult to find nowadays in a regular store so I am glad I can still purchase these on Amazon.,5
"If you still use blank VHS VCs like I do, this three pack is really handy. I know that most of us are using DVDs now, but I still find a use at times for an eight or nine hour VC and this fills the bill. This tape stands up pretty well to being used over and over and I would surely suggested it if tape is what you need.",5
"These tapes are oustanding. Brillant picture. No tracking problems. I used to buy another name brand 8 hour, to many tracking problems. First time buyer for Maxell very happy with the product excellent price and quality.Believe me I have gone through tapes since VCR;s first came out still have the original GE VCR. Cannot go wrong with the Maxell.",5
I gave these tapes an OK rating because they were OK for recording only one time on them but if you had to re-record on them they were no good and unfortunately I found this out the hard way. I would only recommend  these tapes to someone who is only going to use them one time.,3
"Great product that performs exactly as needed.  Great look to it and could not be more pleased.  I live in the absolute boondocks, 88 miles from the nearest WalMart, 50 miles from even a McDonalds burger stand.  I absolutely count on amazon.com to order things I need, they are nicely delivered by mail, UPS or FedEx and spare me the need to travel long expensive miles for some of the simplest things.  AMAZON.COM ROCKS!!!!",5
"My Maxell 213030 VHS T160 Standard Grade - 3 Pack arrived on time and in good condition.  It is very hard to find VHS in retail stores, but I am glad these tapes can be found here at Amazon and other websites as well.  These can record up to 8 hours.  I have a VHS tape eraser, which is a giant magnet, so when after viewing my recorded program I erase them to record another program.  Very durable.  Can be reused over and over again, best when you erase with the tape eraser, otherwise you will see your old program under your new program.  I recommend this product.  I rate this a 5 star.",5
My husband was very please with these VHS tapes and he was excited about the price.  He would definitely purchase more at a later date.,5
"Perfect for people like my daughter who like to record their favorite shows to watch after work at night. With up to 8 hours on a tape, you can get quite a few shows on one tape (of course I don't recommend recording on slow speeds if you want to keep a quality recording.)A perfect solution for those who don't want the expense of Tivo or similar devices.",5
"Item is top-notch for those of us dinosaurs who still use VHS tapes (I have six working in the house (as well as many others in various states of [dis]repair), plus DVD recorders/players.However, I can't say much about the packaging from Amazon.  The enclosure was open (YES, OPEN!) at two ends and no paperwork was enclosed.  I'm hoping someone at Amazon reads this and corrects their quality Assurance procedures.Although the tapes are 5-star, I'm giving this order a 3-star rating because of the packaging.",3
"I use these at work, and the sound is great and the cord frees me from my desk.  (I often have to travel around the building.)  I work with computers andI wasn't sure how it would work with all of the electrically noisy  equipment around us but it works great!  Highly recommended!",5
"[December 2000]I really like these headphones.  I also tried the Sony RF950-RK, which is in a comparable price range.What I liked about Sony:  longer battery life (15 hr instead of 6 hr); there's a stand on which you can hang your headphones; there's an auto on-off feature that saves battery life.What I didn't like about Sony:  you have to take the batteries out and put them into a recharger unit (I was expecting to just hang the headphones on the stand and have them recharge, like the Palm Pilots do in their cradles); when I tilt my head forward (at my desk, since I use these at work), they slide off.What I like about Advent:  the sound is slightly better; the battery recharging is easy (plug it in and it recharges); they are more comfortable than the Sonys.What I didn't like about Advent:  there's no recharging stand; the tuning knob is in a really bad place (where you'd put your hands when you're putting the headphones on).I didn't really care about the range, because I'm really only using them in the same room.  One thing to be aware of: the Advent instruction manual (which nobody reads) says you should plug them into the LINE OUT and not the SPEAKER OUT port.  The line out has a much stronger signal (unless you turn up the volume on the sound source).  There's also an adjustment knob you're supposed to use to get the signal strength up to the right level.  Before I did these two things, I got a lot of noise.  After I read the instructions and set up a strong signal, I had almost no noise.Overall I really love them.  I can listen to music really loud without bothering my officemate, and they're comfortable enough to wear all day without trouble.[December 2003]I no longer use these headphones for day to day use.  After about six months, I got too annoyed with the sound fading in and out, the increasing amount of hiss, and the random loss of stereo signal.  I'm back to using regular wired headphones, this time spending only $18 on an Aiwa pair that I like.  I still use the Advent wireless headphones for occasional TV viewing (where sound quality is not so important), but I wouldn't recommend them.",2
"Not the highest fidelity you will ever hear in a headphone, but if you aren't in a recording studio, and are just listening to music while sitting at home or cleaning, or watching the TV and want headphones so as not to disturb the neighbors, these are perfect. They have more than enough range - I can even go well outside, and still hear the music just fine. They are not quite five stars, though, due to not being fully 'fi', so to speak, and for the annoying need to use another plug cord to recharge the batteries.As far as some other reviewers talking about complications with tuning, maybe I just lucked out, but I had these things tuned in about three seconds. I've also never lost a signal randomly, or had the tuning slowly go out of phase as some others complained.  I will say, though, that the tuning knob on the headphones is right next to the volume knob, and it's very easy to accidentally bump the tuning knob when adjusting the headphones, or when one wants to adjust the volume.  But this is a minor complaint (though I would like to see advent begin to put the tuning knob on the side opposite the volume, or in some other less easily accesible spot).The lows are good, the highs are good, and the ear cushions are very comfy, even for my large head, for extended periods.  The cushions I find to hold in heat from my ears and cause sweating (sorry if that's gross, but you need to know this stuff to be informed). I've always had that problem with all cushioned headphones since many, many ages ago, and so is not a problem with just these headphones, but the Advents cause it sooner than others I have owned - they make a very airtight seal around your ears.For the price, and for the built-in rechargable batteries, these are an excellent deal in my opinion, and I've enjoyed having them and using them, and have just ordered another pair so that my partner and I both can use them to watch movies with explosions and/or loud orchestral soundtracks late at night.",4
"Fine sound, good reception over a decent range (looks like I can get around the yard without them making any big complaints), comfortable.I would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds I'm used to.  And the separation is better than I expected.  There is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on, but I'm pretty picky and I think its totally tolerable.",4
"Overall very pleased with the product. The phones are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house &amp; yard. The quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good. There is an ample supply of cables &amp; adapters, i.e., for plugging into  a computer soundcard.",4
"I'm not brutal with equipment, but in a few short weeks, the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side. Within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together.I use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep. A second convenient bedside charger would be nice. I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge. If you're a  late night TV watcher, you too might call this justifiable laziness. Too many times I put them on the next night and find the battery's down.I honestly think that before I replace them with another wireless, I'd find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone.",1
"Terrific value for the money.  Sound is very clear and warm.  Upper range and midrange as good as very expensive corded  phones and speaker systems. The bass is not muddy, but it  is less pronounced than with good speakers or corded phones. But the overall sound is still excellent.Requires a good deal of adjustment and fiddling to get the best sound and longest transmition range out of it. Don't set the level on the transmitter too high. You will get speaker overload. You can listen throughout your home, patio, and garage.  But you generally get some bursts of static as you walk. None of these drawbacks bothers me.Best for listening to CD's. Sounds great with LP's too, but it transmits more groove wall noise and static than you  are probably used to hearing from the RIAA jacks that your turntable is connected to.",5
"These headphones are a decent wirless solution but are a tale of two realities.Reality 1 - When charged and properly tuned, they sound great; rich bass and full mid range with good highs. Their range is excellent - I have listened to music for 3-4 hours about 100 feet from the base. They are adjustable and accomodate different size heads easily.Reality 2 - The challenge of keeping them tuned and charged is not always easily accomplished. The battery setup and charging arrangement could have been done significantly better. Also unless you want to be adjusting the levels alot you need a fixed level signal. Additionally since the frequency reception is quite contingent upon battery strength, if you don't have the time or means to keep the battery charged to certain levels your performance suffers.Since I am a bit of a techno geek being mindful of charging and frequency adjustment is not a big deal, but others (like my wife) will find it a hassle.",3
".... When I dropped them a day after getting them home, the right earpiece shattered, revealing the inside of a very cheap product. .... The description doesn't tell you that you have to tune the transmitter, then tune the headset until the signals coincide. That takes a little doing to get it right, and I find that the two parts lose each others' signal several times over the course of a couple of hours. I have to re-tune the base and the headset each time they lose each other. It also has an annoying whine most of the time also. Since last XMas, it seems like this is the only wireless headphone product in the retail stores, which is a shame because it is so bad.",1
"Used it as directed on a polkaudio cd player, and it did not improve the machine.  Cannot say for sure that the product didn't work, or the machine is just broken.  Machine started to not recognize certain cds that it played before.  Using the cleaner did not improve the machines performance.",3
"Works very well.  Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem.  Easy to follow audio directions.",5
"For quite a long time I believed that the CD player in my truck was broken.  Then I thought, hey, why not for just a few bucks try this cleaner and maybe it'll work.  It did!  The cleaner is extremely easy to use.  You insert the cleaner disk into your CD player and follow the directions, which are said aloud to you, and in no time the cleaning is done.  After it's done cleaning, the disk plays some nice classical music for you, too.  I ejected the cleaning disk, inserted one of my CDs and voila!  It was working again!",5
"I purchasd a used original xbox really cheap and it wud only play a few games and those that did play wud freeze up. I orderd this lens cleaner and the transformation was instant, plays all my games w no freeze. I also hav a few high end DVD units, one an expensive Samsung DVD recorder that stopped recording and playing discs and a Toshiba upconversion DVD player that stopped reconizing and playing discs. I popped the lens cleaner in and their both working beautiful now, I was going to throw them out. A great product, and I can use it over and over if I hav any other devices that stop reading and playing discs.",5
"I purchased this from Amazon 4 years ago and here it is 4 years later and it still works perfectly.  I had to write a review on such a great product.  It is a definite inconvenience when any of your electronic pieces hit the road.  Your television, cd player, receiver, computer, etc.  These are all necessities and if any of them break down they must be replaced immediately regardless of budget.I live in a highrise apartment right in downtown Boston and there is much dust.  When a cd player starts acting up you don't know what's going on at first.  If its dead, its dead.  But if cds are skipping or playing errartically what do you do?  Is it the player itself?  First you clean the cds.  Maybe its a simple problem.  Well, my cd player was having a field day at the time - cds jumping and skipping all over.  I purchased this product, used it correctly and voila - the cd player worked perfectly.  All the problems cleared up.  Now, whenever it starts to skip I know it is from dust or something in the player and it just needs a simple clean.Bottom line, this product is inexpensive and it works to perfection.  I have had it 4 years and it is still going strong.  I highly recommend this product.  Finally, something that actually does what it says it does.",5
"I have a Modern Warfare 2 edition Xbox 360. It's not that old, but here in West Texas, we get a lot of dust. My console pretty much stopped reading discs. I would have to eject a disc, and put it back in at least 10 times before it would read it. I ordered this based on the reviews. I figured that it may not read the cleaner disc right away, since it didn't read my games. So I put it in, it would spin up, and then would say no disc. This only happened once! The next time I ran it, it read the disc! To be safe, I ran the disc 3 times. I put in a game it would not read, and it read it on the first try! I highly recommend this product.",5
"This product is a wast of money,it is not thing but a cd disc with some soft brushes on it for to spinning around trying to clean the cd player laser eye and this cd disc thing can't clean the laser eye at all.Most portable cd player this day are lid open anyway.You properly can clean the laser eye with a cotton swab with a dip of a little rubbing alcohol.That what I used this product for.",1
"My car's 6 CD changer was intermittently losing and skipping sound in the left channel.  Because the right channel remained OK I did not think it might be a dirt or cleaning issue.  I figured both left and right channels should be affected.  I lamented over my player for weeks because I could ill-afford whatever the cost might have been to even have a tech check out a fancy Bose CD player embedded in the dashboard of a car.  I gradually listened to my player less and less because knowing the sound problem just made me more sensitive to the imperfections when they occurred. Finally I figured, what have I got to lose just to find out if this is a ""dirt"" problem?  $8 bucks compared to all other alternatives was a small price to pay. Hola macarola...I'll be darned if this disc didn't cure my player immediately! I wish I had given this thing a shot a lot sooner.  Technically there was problem though.  The instructions say the CD has sound.  It's supposed to alert you when it's done cleaning or whatever.  My product produced no sound at any time.  I inserted it into my player and my dash display simply blinked indicating a playing disc. It ran, and ran, and ran.  It never alerted me in any way that the process was over nor did it stop running on its own.  I simply had to eject it. I deducted one star only because of this ""technicality"".",4
"I have the Boston Acoustics bookshelf-style player (no longer made, sadly).  It's a great CD player and radio, with all of the features I wanted.  (It looks and functions like the Bose model...but I hate Bose with such a passion, I would've paid more to NOT buy their product.)The BA unit kept returning an error message, ""CD ?""  after one was inserted.  This cleaner, used one time, fixed the problem.  Problem hasn't occurred again, in more than a year.I was hesitant to try it....some reviews and advice said it could ruin the system.  But I was going to not use the system anyway....so I took a chance.  Turned out to be a good decision, but I don't know enough about WHY it works to say it would be safe for every unit.",5
"Dont waste the money.Used multiple times on two different units, did NOTHING to either......DON'T BOTHER.",1
I thought my expensive old Sony CD player was finished - it skipped and sound was not as good.  Allsop restored the player to original good quality.  I highly recommend this product.,5
"I can't say with any certainty that it's the end all laser cleaner. It's ingeneous approach does seem clever though. Consumers buy this product when their CD player starts skipping. I did too. If you're  lucky enough that the problem is a dirty laser, you're in luck. One cannot expect this humble product to fix a mechanical or lubrication problem. Good luck, it's definitely worth a try.",5
"THIS CD CLEANER HAS MORE BRUSHES TO DO A LITTLE MORE CLEANING TO A CD PLAYER, BUT IT'S NOT ADVANCED ENOUGH FOR A CAR CD PLAYER.",4
"Over the course of the last few months my CD player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a CD at all. 5 minutes after my package arrived with this CD cleaner in it and I was playing CDs again. I can also play CDRs now, something my stereo hasn't been able to do for six months.",5
I purchased item for my PC/laptop/boombox/DVD player.Just for maintenance to keep eye lens clear of any dirt/dust after using it on all of 3-5 items their was a coat of dust/dirt on disc.WOW what a surprise I try to keep my electronics clean  & dust free every 2-3 months but dust/dirt seem to find it's way inside electronics.,4
"This product really does make a difference.  I had an older CD player that was doing a lot of skipping, and sometimes it would not function at all.  I ran the cleaning disc through it once, and now it's working just fine.  Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player!",5
I have only used it once and it cleared the skipping problem. It has an interesting method to the way it works by playing a piece of classical music while the lens cleaner cleans the lens.,5
Tried this on our 2004 Toyota Highlander. The CD player wouldn't even read the disk. Tried several times. Don't waste your money.,1
"Can't say enough good things about this. It took less than a minute to clean my very dirty car CD player. I was shocked that it worked so fast ! Just listen to the voice and switch to track 3, then after the music on the cleaning disk stops, remove the disk and your done. Unless they came out with a better product, I don't know why they stopped selling this one !",5
"The CD player in my car went haywire. CD's were skipping and others wouldn't play at all. Thought maybe it may need a ""clean up.""  WOW! Put this in the CD player...ran it twice. That's all it took. And to think, I was ready to pay to have a new one installed. Have to agree with others...don't buy a new CD player before trying this. Besides, the music on the CD isn't so bad either...yes...there's music on the CD cleaner.",5
My professional CD players have always performed well.  They are &#34;broadcast quality&#34; units and it is just not acceptable to have them skip or not read a disc.  One of my players recently began to do just that and I was hoping to just get the lens cleaned with a laser-lens cleaner.  This particular product did the job and so far the unit reads better and does not skip anymore.,5
"When the CD drive on my Toshiba laptop refused to write to CD's I was convinced I was in for a big bill. Then I decided to try the Allsop CD laser-lens cleaner. It cured my problem in less than 5 minutes. So, if the problems you are experiencing are the result of dirt or dust this is a simple and effective solution. But, don't expect it to cure mechanical or other problems. If your CD drive is giving you problems, this is worth a try. If it doesn't work you are not out much and you know the problem isn't dirt on the lens. My only complaint is that it is not clear when it is through cleaning, so I cleaned the lens 3 times before I was convinced it was done.",5
"This laser-lens cleaner works well for what we intended to use it for, it helps to eliminate dust from our CDs.",5
"I was looking for an economical cleaning solution for my DVDs so took a chance on these and ordered them from Amazon. I don't know what they're made of but they work great. They clean blu-ray as well as regular DVDs without a bit of scuffing or scatching. I followed the instructions and wiped the discs from the centre toward the outside edge. For fingerprints, I found it also helps to breathe on the disc before wiping. The nice thing about these is that they're re-usable until they get dirty.",5
"I was expecting to buy a cleaning system that has at least a liquid solution, and of course those fancy ones with a machine that rotates the discs! But ended up trying this out because of it's cheap price and it's ""FastWipe"" title, but still a bit skeptical without any wet solution.I am pleasantly surprised that the dry fabric actually removed finger print and dusts rather easily with push of a thumb from center of the disc outward. The discs are cleaned within a matter of 15 to 20 seconds for a thorough job. I find myself having fun wiping the entire collection of CDs, DVDs, and blu-ray discs.",5
"These are good cd cleaning wipes for cleaning fingerprints, stain, and other marks on a cd to avoid going to a dvd store to get it cleaned. Good additions for cd protections.",5
I USED THIS ON A DISK I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH. AFTER I USED THIS THE DISK PLAYED FINE.THE INSTRUCTIONS TOLD ME TO WIPE ON THE SIDE WITH NO PRINTING. I WAS ALWAYS WIPING ON TOP.,5
I down load a lot of CD's and need to keep them nice and clean. I will use these wisely and keep all my music cd's clean from finger prints and dust. Thank you so much. Beverly,5
Had old movies that we were unable to view because they kept skipping. Gave them a good cleaning and all were view able.,4
I have a Netflix subscription and receive DVDs in the mail. There are a high number of these discs that have scratches and smudges on them. Rather than send it back because it won't play correctly I give them a quick wipe with these cloths and have had success with almost every DVD.,4
There is really not much you can say about a clean wipe. The product does clean fingerprints on the DVD. I'm very satisfied with the product. If it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even better.,4
These CD or DVD wipes are good for removing surface lint or smudges on Disks but dont expect them to remove serious glitches or hang ups. They are dry thats the first hing so they cant really be expected to remove any ingrained glitches but cetainly for the maintenance of disks and keeping them dust free these are very good. I was looking for somthing that would really help to illiminate some hang ups and getting stuck type glitches that I had so in fact I ended up just buying a new DVD of the same recording...but its a good product for maintenance. I guess the lesson I learnt is not to leave the disk in the player when not being used. Also the method to wipe off a disk is so important not to use a circular motion say like you would on an old LP recording..so I did in fact also learn something from the instructions as well.,4
You can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk.  It did not remove the scratches from my disk.  Waste of money.,2
"Pretty simple product.  There are about 30 or so sheets in a package. Take one out and wipe in a circular motion.  Gets rid of the smudges and makes the disc shine.  However, if your kids touch it with grimy fingers it will struggle to remove those types of stains.",5
"These are indespenisible around our house. Out grandchilden find then and play with them.  I've witnessed them trying to get our wee dog, Nola, to catch as one would catch a frisbee.  Thankully, we have only totally lost a few CD's.  Easily replacable!",5
I use these wipes all the times on my electronics. They are lintless and have many uses besides wiping clean CDs and DVDs. I use them from time to time to clean VCR heads too. I just cut a small section and saturate it in alcohol. It works a treat. I highly recommend them.,5
"Very handy. And reusable. well, .....now I have to provide more words.... Handy, handy, handy! I just need to remember to use, especially on RENTAL DVDs.",4
This was the first time I have used such a product and was pleased with the results.  Works great for a fast clean before playing,5
I got these to clean dirty DVD and Bluerays that I got from Netflix. Works great. Saves a lot of frustration when a movie stops or skips because of crud on the disk.,5
"I purchased this allsop CD and DVD fastwipes, and cannot complain about the product for the cost and how they work, especially when picking up DVDs or CD's from the library to watch or listen to that have smudges that can break up the signal, and freeze the visual.  They do work but don't expect miracles for nicked or the surface film damaged DVD's that need to be tossed.  Recommend this product for a fast and time saving cleanup of your DVD or CD, I am definitely going to order another pack before I run out.",5
"I use these to clean every movie I receive from Netflix. I repurchase these wipes every couple of months to clean rented Blu-Ray movies, Wii, and PS3 games. I prefer to see the dirt I'm removing. Make sure you wipe back and forth, away and towards the center of the disc, instead of wiping in circles, as stated in the directions.",5
"I just needed a product to quickly wipe down my rented movies, or used DVDs and CDs I purchase online or at garage sales, etc. So far it appears to work well.  Nice price.",4
Good price but they don't work as good as a mild detergent and warm water.  These still leave fingerprints on the disc.  Good for a quick wipe but not a through cleaning.,5
in order to read on the package instructions that the cleaning cloths may scratch your discs...but instructions say don't worry it won't affect the playing... I ordered these wipe to clean the discs without risks of scratching them...so I was totally horrified by this information. I currently use a lens cleaning cloth for glasses from my optician. No problem with scratches but more expensive.I RETURNED this product because I was afraid as the package warns that I could scratch my discs. I would not have ordered if anyone had mentioned this information on the website so I could evaluate the risks and make a wise buying decision.,1
these wipes did get the job done but the fabric doesn't hold up long but for a quick cleaning its good just to have around when u are on the go...,3
I have looking around for this item for some time. I had some trouble fined them. It work really good.,5
"I have usually used wet cleaners for my discs but have run into quality control problems with the units.  I decided to try these, not expecting much.  Surprise, they work great!  I had purchased some discs with excessive fingerprints and the like, these cleaned the discs right up.  As noted in the item description some small scratches or scuffing can be caused by the wipes, not a major problem if care is taken. I will definitely buy again when my supply is gone!",5
"At first I thought it was little bit expensive price, but when I get it and use it, it is not, definately worth the money.This CD & DVD wipes really cleans. The wipes is good quality cleaning materials, cleans the dirts and finger prints off the DVDs very well.I definately recommend to give this a try, worth your money, it does the job good. Thanks Amazon!",5
"I had a DVD that kept on not playing every other disc l got from Netflix. It would say the disc was dirty or scratched. I gave any one that didn't play a good clean with these wipes but rearly got any to work. Maybe if you had dusty CD's but l never got any sense that this was ""cleaning"". More of a light polish. Didn't work for me.",2
Did not clean my cds as good as it says. they were still scatched.  would not recommend this products to anyone,2
DVD Fastwipes clean my cd's and dvd's and make them extremely clean it wipes of dust and dirt and does a great job!,5
"I just bought my second pack of these wipes. I bought the first pack late last year and am finally running out of them. I was totally surprised that these wipes work so well. I have had DVD's that skipped and could see that there was junk on the surface. Taking one of these wipers and wiping the surface from the center to the edge (across the grooves) seems to get the job done. Today, my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a DVD he handed to me. When I put it in the player it skipped and then stopped. I pulled it out and saw the crud. I used a fresh wiper and Voila!! the DVD played without a hitch. I know I am probably not supposed to do this, but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a DVD and I use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two. I haven't seen a downside. I truly think they are amazing.",5
"I have small children who often put fingerprints on our kiddie DVDs.  Typically, I clean them by ""breathing"" on the dirty DVD and using the inside of my T-shirt to wipe clean these DVDs.  However, I began to look for another solution that didn't involve my T-shirt.  This product ... the Allsop CD and DVD fast-wipes looked like a possible solution, so I ordered a pack.After giving them a try, I find they work well ... they don't get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help (or in my case, a ""breath"" on the DVD), but they get about 95 percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily.  The material is lint free and works as advertised.  20 CD/DVD shaped wipes come per pack.  Being shaped like a DVD is just a gimmick.  I usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping, so if they were square-shaped (and thus had a little more material) it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle.  The instructions say that each wipe can be re-used until it becomes visably dirty or worn, so you can clean multiple DVDs per wipe.Overall, these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price.  Four stars.",4
I have purchased many of these Belkin Velcro Cable ties over the past few years. They are well made and very useful.,5
"I love these things, in fact I use them in my backpack to manage the cables I travel with. Power adapters for tablets, phones, chargers and computers, with all that i carry a bunch of cables. so its nice to have these!",5
"If you have cords that you want to identify or cords that you need to pack away then these are excellent.  I use them on my laptop power cords, headphone cords, etc.",5
My stereo system was a jungle of wires once i used these cable times I tamed that jungle.  I love that I can remove the cables that I no longer need and add new cables without cutting cable ties.,5
These work and look exactly as expected.  Easy to use.  What more can I say about Velcro strips? Evidently I need to say more to meet the minimum word requirement to post this review.,5
This are great. They are high quality. Nothing more to say really except that they work. I use it for all the cables on my computer.,5
"Cable ties works as they are promised to. Was able to organize the cables behind the TV, looks much better. Preferred to use these over the smaller ties, the larger velcro straps allow multiple larger cables to be bundled together.",4
They work as I expected they would without too much extra material left over and here are my last words.,4
"Quick, reusable, and color coded... these velco cable ties are a fast and effective way to cable management.  Easy and reusable, unlike zipties.",5
"i definitely prefer the radio shack ties because you can adjust the tie to the size of the tie to the cable, and the whole strip is velcro so no extra cable hangs off of the bundle.  but these are a little cheaper and work most of the time too.",3
"Good Product and different colors come in handy for using a certain color for a specific device, they are priced right so like me I bought 5 packs that way I have 5 ties of the same color.",5
"These are OK for wrapping cables behind your desk or something like that, but they do not attach to cables.  If you are putting them on cables that you wrap and unwrap on a regular basis these are not so good.  Seemed to be designed for semi permanent installations, not for daily work",3
"For no more than they cost, I would recommend these to everyone. Yes the colors are rather primary and boring, but they are dirt cheap and have withstood daily use and abuse.These travel around in my flight case and camera bags all the time and still work great. I'm ordering more as soon as I finish typing this review.  Seriously, stop reading and just buy them already!",5
"As others have noted, there is only a small amount of velcro to hold.Also, I like the type of ties that you can wrap first around the cable (so you don't lose the tie) and then around the bundle.With the way these work, you can't do that.If you want ties in different colors and you won't be using them much (e.g. wrapping up a cable and storing it in a drawer until you need it) then these might be ok..but for the road warrior trying to keep all his cables organized, pick something else.",2
"These were purchased as an &#34;add on&#34; item and must say that they fit the bill in our house.  We use them as a tie on the cords for equipment that we move around the house.  Easy to wrap and unwrap.  Thanks, Amazon!",5
As someone with far to many computers anything that helps me tame the mess of wires is welcome.  this fit the bill well and I like the tab that makes them easy to remove.,5
"These are great. That the hooks of the velcro only occupy a small strip on the band isn't a big deal. They hold well, they're colorful, and good quality. My strips from eight years ago still work.",5
"I use these every day for keeping cords neat since I have a lot of computer equipment, ipad accessories, power cords, etc.",5
"These little cable ties may not be of the highest quality, but they do work, and you sure get a great deal considering the price.There is only Velcro on part of the strip, so I don't know how long the tie would last if  you were tying and untying it all the time.  What I have found, is that if I just tie something up and leave the cable types alone, these work great.I am happy with them.",4
"I travel with cpap machine and this works great for my hose, power cord and extension cord. Highly recommended, A+++",5
I use these all the time to organize my cables and power cords. They are long enough to do a great job (nlike some that are too short to wrap the entire cable).I recommend them.,4
"This is cool and all, but I was a little upset when I found out I could buy it at the dollar store for about half the price.",4
"I have been using these for a few years as I use Belkin A/V Pure cables a lot. The colored ones are nice, think I will use them to color code cables.",5
A simple little product that is a great help in keeping control cords used on a video jib. I like having them in various colors so as to be able to keep track better of several different cords. These are well made.,5
"I love this things. I use them to keep wires contained and out of the way, and I use them to keep things organized and handy. They can be reused over and over, and the colors help to organize and mark things.",5
They are simple and easy to use.  The eight inch length will wrap around a fairly large bundle.  I bought  them to use on earbud cables and charger cables for which I trim them to about 3 inches in length.,4
"Strong velcro grip, long enough to wrap a bunch of cables together, short enough to still be convenient when just wrapping one.  Good product.",5
"These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are  8"" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.",5
"These straps are great for the general purpose of organizing entertainment center cords,  computer system cords... Etc.  My intended use for these straps was to manage cords for medical equipment during travel.  The worn straps these were to replace looped onto a cord before wrapping allowing it to stay in place when the cords are released.  Unfortunately,  these are missing that same basic design feature making them more likely to get lost as you need to secure it everytime you release the cord,  whereas other velcro straps remain secure at all times.  Not a big deal if you just want to organize cords of stationary electronics,  but then again for that purpose you may as well save a few dollars and buy a bag of classic zip ties.",3
I hate having long cords gather up in a pile and look ugly. These ties do the job and make it look more organized.,5
"This is a great set of reusable color codes cable ties for medium to large wires. They are a bit to big for smaller wires and you need to get at least a thumb full of wire to secure them properly(Picture sizing out Spagetti for two people big). If you need it for a few small wires it won't work as well. These are also a bit hard to use inside a computer case because of the excess material. I see the appication for these more like using them to bind togther cords from a home entertainment system, or the mess of cords coming from the back of the computer.",4
"Performs as expected from any cable tie. I like that it's Velcro and reusable unlike the stiff plastic ties. I used it to clean up the wires under my desk in my tiny cubicle at work, so that I'm not constantly kicking or stepping on wires.",5
Belkin has never let me down.  I had order 2 of these packages and used them all - and am ordering more.  I'm also ordering a longer length version.,4
"It;s so much easier to wrap a long cord and put a velcro tie to hold the cable in a shorter,bundle than having several feet of all the cords.",5
"They were only a buck as an add on item and work as expected. Honestly, it's easier to use a small plastic rubber band if it's a cord you're going to constantly use...",3
"Boo, hiss, buy the 50 count one in my other review. For some reason these are short and they are not designed to stay on a cable like the other ones I reviewed.",2
I was looking for Velcro ties that had the loop that i could slide the many iPad/iPhone cables i carry through. These ties will keep your cables bundled individually but i would prefer an additional loop or eye for the cable than i would wrap the excess around.,1
"I've been using these allot latley and these work great! Don't tear or come apart and the velcro is enough for office use. NOT recomended for giging musicians or roadies, these are not strong enough for road use but great in the office.",5
"Short, sweet, and colorful. Everything you could want in velcro ties. =]I'm not sure how else to rate these. They're as advertised. For me, it was hard to find short sizes, and they were close enough. The colors are an added bonus. They are high-quality, sturdy, and lock together well.",5
"I love the fact that they work well, don't separate and can hold alot of cords at the same tome.  My husband hates seeing cables all mess - I always have a spare set for him.  All the cables are color coordinated at are place and these are the reason why",4
"This product is very good: high quality, good service, and fast ship. It is sutable with my think before I got it.",5
these work for just about anything that you might need them for.  there are only six in the package so you don't get very many.,4
If you are looking for something to bundle your cords together or if you have mess behind your TV and/or computer I would suggest these to help you get the cords organized.,4
"These are the typical hook and loop solution.  They are mostly loop, and towards the end there is a 1&#34; piece of loop sewn on.  I found this to be rather stiff and didn't readily bend to conform to the cables I was wrapping.  8&#34; is a nice length, but much longer than what I needed, so I ended up wrapping around a few times before trying to close it.  You could probably cut an end off, but I like longer ties, as it seems I'm constantly moving things around and I get very frustrated when I find something a few inches short.  If the 1&#34; hook part were not as stiff I'd give it the extra star.",4
Fine little Velcro ties. The ties lack a tie to the cable (I use them for extension cords). If they had a small slot to double them back through it in order to fasten them to the cable then I would rate 5 stars.,4
theres Belkin Velcro Cable Ties (8 Inch) are excellent.  with the color pattern i am able to label both ends of my cables making it a cinch to locate the one I'm looking for.  all of my cables are bound together with the monster cable management system also sold on amazon,5
Needed some wire wraps (instead of wire ties) to keep my bass guitar amp power cord and equipment cord(s) in place while not in use. I tried some other brands and was more of a &#34;pain&#34; than help. Seen this at Amazon and it couldn't work better. Easy to put on and easy to remove and keeps the cables nicely tied when needed. Get price too even if it is an &#34;Add-On Item&#34;. Thanks : ),5
Don't spend a lot of money.  Buy these easy to use velcro cable tie wraps that allow you to use and reuse over and over again  Comes in multiple color pack (for that color coding you want to do).  Remember these aren't just for cables.  I've used them to hold shelves together for extra support!  These really stay stuck together!  I've chained a few together for a bigger project I needed help together.  A must have in any household.,5
"I carry these in my tool box and found them handy to use, especaily with the different colors to chose.  I have used them to temporarily hold something in place while I am trying to drill it in place.  I have even connected severl together for larger items.",5
"These ties are perfect for managing cords. I like that they are reusable and can color-code your electronics. I use the colors based on sound cords. For example: black/silver for HDMI and red/green/blue for composite.I would recommend getting two packages though, you'll probably need more than you think.",5
"One inch of the eight is the name tag (belkin), another inch is the hook portion of Velcro.  If there is any movement in the cable bundle you wrapped, it all comes undone, (except that 1"" of Valcro) What a waste of money. Buy something else, I am having to.",1
"Pros:- Does what it's suppose to do with excellence.- The Multiple Colors help a lot in organizing which cord go with what or which cord are what.- Velcro is effective and sturdy- Great priceCons:- Only bad thing about this, is I wish it came with more Ties, but I don't really think thats a good enough reason NOT to buy itOverall:Excellent choice if you don't want to get the highly expensive cable shields and very reliable. Great choice and Great Buy!",5
"Great wire ties.  Easy to use, release and reuse. The colors make it easy to identify different cords. Highly recommend.",5
"I first got these because I needed just over 80 cents to get free shipping on an order.  In that aspect these little things are great!There isn't much to say about a cable tie, but for that extra nudge to get free shipping, these are a must!Pros-inexpensive bump to get free shipping-velcro, and multi colored-no more crazy wires!Cons-tag fell off of one, but for under 3 bucks, not that big a deal-too short for anything other than cables, again not a real con but it would be great to see a similar product with more length.I bought 3 packs of these so far and as long as I still have cables, I will slowly get more with each Amazon purchase :)",5
"I have used a couple of types of Velcro cable ties in the past.  The best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with  a slot in the top, so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped.  These have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie.  You have to wrap it carefully (and not particularly tightly) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks.  If you unwrap the cable the tie falls off.  These a just considerably more annoying to use than the type I first described.  One other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you aren't going to be undoing them regularly.  True, but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost.",2
"well, they are velco so they work. they do get lost easily though, kind of wish i had bought a different kind....",3
"Umm...seriously? $1.63 for these? These cable ties are really good quality, have a nice long strap with a tight velcro to secure them all. Different colors makes it easier (kind of) to keep things organized, but at the very least it adds a bit of color to the jungle of cables you have.",5
I don't have much to compare these to except for the heavy duty version that I use for power cables and extension cords in the garage. These are obviously light duty. Works great for computer and game cables. They are atrong enough to hold my Hdmi switch box strapped to the pole of my computer desk to make it easily accessible.,4
"The only thing I wish these had was some means to loop through, so that they could be attached securely to one end of the cable. Otherwise I just wrap one end around the cable and staple the two ends together, and now it's &#34;permanently&#34; tethered to one end.I guess the only other downside might be that the option to purchase a single colour was not available. What if you want to have only one colour for your cables, so that they don't end up being in your partner's case?  And I suppose the colours could've been brighter.But they do look nice, and there's plenty of length to handle just about any normal length of cable being wrapped up.",4
It is Belkin product so it is of high quality.It does the job it was marketed for.I would recommend purchasing the cable ties.,3
You can never have enough Velcro cable ties.  I use them for everything.  I also have plenty around. Never know when you need one.,5
"I've used these velcro straps, and similar velcro straps from other manufacturers, for several years now to secure cables for computer systems, networking systems, and entertainment systems in my home.  Before I discovered the velcro cable ties, I was using the plastic cable ties where you feed one end through a hole in the other end, pull until tight, and cut off the ""tail"".  But the thing I didn't like about the plastic cable ties is they can't be re-used and you have to cut them to remove them.  That's not a problem if you rarely mess with your equipment and cables, but in my case I seem to be upgrading something, moving something, repairing something, or throwing something away on a regular basis.  That meant I was regularly cutting a bunch of plastic cable ties, getting new ones, and re-tieing everything, which I sort of began to dread and then loath.  The velcro cable ties make it alot easier.There's is a somewhat peculiar skill involved in learning how to wrap these things around a bundle of cables and getting them tight, but once you figure it out, it's very simple and you can get them very tight if you want.  I've never had one come lose on its own, so they're also very reliable.  Basically I'd recommend this type of cable tie to anyone, and this particular product from Belkin has worked well for me.",5
"green ones for hard drive, red ones for DVD-drive, ... blue cable tie to help with fans and wires.Worth every cent.  Every pc enthusiast should have some sort of advanced cable-tie system in place.",5
These ties are great for something you repeatedly bundle and unbundle like a laptop power cord.  They're slightly expensive per strap but are worth it in my opinion.,4
"You can buy the same thing at the dollar store. Save yourself the five dollars, but if you want color coding, this will work well for quick visual ID.",5
"I'll never understand why re-useable cable ties are so expensive, or so unavailable.  These Belkins are really for permanent stereo or computer installation.  And even for that purpose, I don't care for their design.If you are a musician looking to tie up microphone, speaker or instrument cables, these are not suitable.",2
"Easy to use, I needed them to organize all the cables in my desk, they work but I would rather to get the 6 of them in one single color.",3
"These are so much better than using zip-ties!n They're easy to see, and - more important - much easier to remove! How many times have you needed to remove a zip-tie and you had to find something sharp, then hope you didn't cut through whatever you had bundled together?! These are great for the job!",5
"Nice for small cable bundling, but not enough Velcro for large bundles.Works great in computer cases for cable dressing.",4
"Same review from me as for the Case Logic Cable Ties.  These are fine, but because they're only grippy on about an inch at the end, they really only work well on larger cables, like power cords and ethernet cables, etc.  I wanted them to wrap up all the little headphone and micro usb cables that I have cluttering my backpack.  And these definitely are not good for those size cables.  The colors are nice and will help you corral cables at your desk.",4
Easy to use velcro fasteners to keep wiring tidy and neat with a belkin labeled pull take to easy undo the fastener. It works.,5
"I use these to hold my kitchen appliance cords.  They work great, I use to use twist ties, which worked, but these are just so much nicer.  The entire strip is velcro and then the one end has the sticky part.  They come in multi colors.",4
"Got these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center. In essence, they work. They are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords, holding them in one, neat bundle. They aren't really meant for identifying cables,  but for holding several in a bundle. Because they work great, I can't give them less than 4 stars. $3 and change is pretty cheap, but if you wanted, you could do the same job with much cheaper products,  which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.Summary: Works great. Cheap, but cheaper options available.",4
"They're little velcro straps.  Not much to say here, they work exactly as you'd think they would and do a great job of keeping cables organized.",5
"The product works great but after doing a little more research I found that you can get 100 Velcro cable ties for about $7. With these, you're basically paying for the little Belkin label that is sewn on. Just do an Amazon search for Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties.I don't recommend this product unless you absolutely only need 5 of them and want a brand name sewn on. They did work great but just not worth it to me compared to other options on Amazon.",3
"If you've got any devices that have cables, this is the best system for keeping the cables controlled.  Whether you're traveling or simply want to gather cables together so they're not hanging or lying all over the place, these &#34;ties&#34; do the job.",5
"those are exceptionally well made. I used &#34;cheapo&#34;-products before but these are really nice quality and come with a sling on one end that allow you to slide it onto a wire, provided the plug on either side is not too large, so it does not fall off when untied.",5
the whole tie Velcro to  it self only at the end of it is there the opposite type of Velcro.,1
"I absolutely love these ties and purchased 2 sets.  I'm a guitarist and constantly having to wrap up chords and wires is annoying, especially when I try to take them out again only to find them a tangled mess! Ties are a perfect solution to this problem.  I wrap them up and stack them, then when I use them again they're still nicely placed.They look exactly as they do in the picture and function as well as you would think.  They are velcro and they hold very well.  I've had no problems with them yet.  I have been using them heavily (taking them off and putting them back on again) for months and haven't noticed much wear at all.  Sometimes the soft side of velcro frays and becomes useless over time but I have noticed almost none of this with the Belkin product.My only complaint would be that they are a little pricey for something that just holds stuff together but you definitely get what you pay for.",5
This is just a high speed USB cable and is of Belkin's normal good quality.  It does what it is suppose to do and the price is excellent.,5
I had a printer I needed to connect to and this was great for doing that and the price was great for what I needed it for.,5
"I had to buy a printer cable for my Epson 890.  When I priced around, this could not be beat.WILL NOT WORK WITH PARALLEL PORT ONLY COMPUTERS For the person that had a previous review, this is a cable that will only work on a printer that has a USB outlet.  This is not for printers that are strictly parallel port hook ups.ENDS FOR PRINTER AND COMPUTER DIFFERENT The USB end that is for the printer if you look in the photo, is the small end to the left.  It is only about 3/16&quot; wide and shorter than that.  The USB end for the computer is the big end to the right in the picture(about 3/8&quot; wide and shorter than that).MANY USB PRINTERS HAVE BOTH USB AND PARALLEL PORT CONNECTIONS Many USB printers have both a parallel port cable connection as well.  That is one of those huge flat type ones (roughly 2&quot; wide).This may sound simple for all you computer experts out there, but with the plentitude of this type of cable or that, it can get very confusing.Great buy.",5
"I had no idea what this cable was because I found it in my drawer one day, I thought it was the VCR cable and I tried to hook it up to the TV and VCR one day and nothing happened except the reception on my TV went bland and empty.",2
"I had no idea what this cable was because I found it in my drawer one day, I thought it was the VCR cable and I tried to hook it up to the TV and VCR one day and nothing happened except the reception on my TV went bland and empty.",2
You did a great job sending this printer cable to me! I got it really fast too! thank you!,5
"Bought it on sale.  Cheapest I found, no problems.",5
"I purchased this cable for my brand-new wireless printer after it didn't work so wirelessly after all. I leave the cable attached to the printer, and simply plug the USB into my laptop when I needed to print a document. The cable has worked great over the past several months. I did check my local electronic superstore before purchasing a cable via Amazon, but I found that comparable cables a ran a high dime. For its quality, you can't beat the price.",5
I have been using this cable with my Samsung Laster printer for over 2 years now and couldn't be happier with the no problem performance.Its long enough to be used as a printer cable (which is important) and it works.  What more can you ask for from a usb cable?Much nicer setup than the bulky parallel port setup.,5
"This cord does what it says, dont waste your money on ""top-of-the-line"" cords they sell at best buy or other palces. They all do the same thing!",5
Excellent cable.  Very reliable.  Now if only my operating system is the same way....,5
clean connections and flexible cable. no reason topay 2x or more for any other cable that does justthe same.,5
"There is not much to say! The Belkin USB Cable works and is priced right on Amazon when compared to the ""Big Box"" stores. If you have a need for this item, get it. You can't go wrong.",5
"It works great to run a cable from the computer to the photo printer. The Cable works great, love how long it is.",5
What can I say about belikin?  Belkin makes GREAT products which makes me satisfied with this cable!,5
Please price this Belkin USB Pro Series 2.0 cable at your local office supply store.  I did.  It is over $20.00.  Another amazing Amazon deal. We have three in use.  Stocking up on a couple of extra at $4.95 each with free shipping is a good idea.  Quality printer cables will only increase in the future.  And the hits just keep on coming.,5
These are excellent quality USB cables that will allow you to connect any USB device (printer etc.)to your PC or other USB device.,5
Its always good to have extra USB cables floating around.  2 for home 2 for work and 2 for the laptop/spare.,5
"I decided to purchase this cable after noticing that Dell Computers offers it online at its online store, which it often bundles together with other data transfer hardware. So I decided that if this cable is sufficiently well-made for Dell to offer it at its online store, then it's one I had to consider seriously as a USB cable linking my laptop computer with a brand new laser printer. Without question, I made the right decision. I am quite impressed with its excellent data transfer speed, superb workmanship and ease of use. It's an excellent product which I highly recommend to others seeking a well made high speed USB cable.",5
I bought this cable to use with my new printer.  I've had it for about 2 months now and it's working fine.,5
"I've always seen high-quality products from Belkin, and this one is no exception. It is a high-quality USB cable at a great price, by a leading computer accessory company. An extra bonus is the lifetime warranty!",5
"There's no reason at all to buy misc. electronic USB cables anywhere except through Amazon!  Prices at the 'shacks'...'marts'.....and the less'es - usually will cost you more than double for the same electronic items found on Amazon.  So let your motto always be ""Caveat emptor"" i.e., buyer beware!!",5
I really like Belkin products and this cord works great from my pc to the printer and could not ask for it to do more,5
Hooked it up between my printer and my PC and printed about 700 pages with it.  Works fine.  Not as quite as cheep as monoprice but the super saver shipping will make up for that if you're ordering more stuff.,5
"Does the job intended, good value, good quality. Not a bad product for the price.There are better products out there, but not at this price point.",5
It might be a little short but seems to be a fine cord (don't know what else to say),5
"My 'Amazon Verified Purchase' badge for this cable dates all the way back to September 23, 2002 according to my Instant Order Update. Ironically the cable is in the other room connected to a printer and still transmitting flawlessly. The moral is this is one well constructed cable and has returned my investment many times over.The connectors still mate and disengage smoothly like the first day I used it, and I am pretty sure that the beefy strain reliefs on each end are responsible for keeping the conductors inside the thick insulator intact. Indeed, as I inspected this cable before writing this review I marveled at the construction and materials. Both are first rate.This cable has traveled extensively - it was part of my travel kit when I was a road warrior consultant, and served me well in many US states as well as the Middle East on long and short assignments. Back to the strain reliefs: I would hastily pack and literally ball this cable up and throw it in my laptop case, yet the ends never damaged, which I attribute - in part - to the strain reliefs that kept crimps from breaking or fraying the conductors.Bottom line - this model is now USB 2.0 compatible and is built to last. In other words, you cannot go wrong.",5
"This is a good USB cable.  It is compatible with both USB 1.0 and 2.0 ports.  It is long enough to give great flexibility with arraging whatever it needs to be connected to.  The price is extremely good (even though amazon.com changes it every now and then) for this cable.  It is way more expensive in stores.  And getting a Belkin product for such a low price is excellent.  This is totally worth the money, and is a great buy if you need a USB cable.",5
"I was looking for a USB2 cable to hook up my all-in-one printer, I found this and I don't regret it, the build quality is excellent, I recommend it.",5
"Considering all the over-priced products on themarket,this cable does the job perfectly and theprice is great.  Thanks Amazon.",5
"This is a reliable brand and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Great product for the price.  I only needed one, but was tempted to purchase more just because it was a great value.  I would buy again.",5
package was recieved barely 2 days after i orderd it i am extremely happy  would that all packages arrived asPromptly as this one,5
"Okay, since most of the printers don't come with cables any longer, you always need to purchase one separately.  A &quot;regular&quot; printer cable can cost around $20 and it can be difficult to plug and unplug correctly without breaking one or more of those tiny prongs.  So a USB cable is a great solution.  It costs less and it's easy to plug and unplug, especially if your computer has front-mounted USB ports.  I bought this one for my new HP LaserJet 1012 Printer and it works just fine.  For this price, it's a great bargain.",5
"I purchase a new ink-jet printer from a very well known computer store ... I wonder who that might be... hehe!  But getting back to the review ... As most of you know, a lot of USB devices don't come with a USB cable. The same thing applied when I purchased my new printer.  The clerk who sold me the printer suggested I purchase a USB cable along with my printer ... the asking price: $29.95 for a 8 foot long cable.  I told him &quot;NO&quot;.  Then purchased this cable on Amazon for $10.95 which included shipping.  The only thing that got to me about this deal was that the shipping cost more than I paid for the USB cable.  Oh well!  I bought some sushi with the 19 bucks that I saved!",5
Basically needed a longer cord for my USB hub. The stock cable that came with it was SO short. Didn't want to spend a ton of $$ but still needed something with good connectors and decent speed. This did the job without breaking the bank.Would recommend!,4
Extremely low price at a high quality made. The cost of it is only a small fraction of any cables price at stores.,4
"I'm not sure how this can be advertised as a Belkin product.  The cord that was sent to me is clear with two bright blue LEDs on the ends.  It works, just bring some sunglasses.",2
"When I bought a new printer for the computer I use, I needed a USB cable to connect the printer to the hard drive.  I ended up purchasing this USB cable from Belkin. It works great and I've never had any problems with it. Even though the cable is a 2.0 device, it is apparently backwards compatible and will work with most 1.0 devices, too.",5
"Absolute dependability, no matter the device they connect.",5
Ran a local networked computer on this wire and had no issues whatsoever.Good quality and no speed issues whatsoever.Update 10-24-2010:Still using the wire for networking with zero issues.,5
THe item arrived in a timely matter and works great!,5
"Not much to say since it's just a USB cable.  I ordered it, it arrived, and it works.  I plugged one end into my computer and the other end into my printer and lo & behold I can now print things from my computer, just as you might expect.  It does what it's supposed to do with no problems, so five stars.  Too bad everything can't be that simple.",5
this cable is very good i recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend it,5
This makes it much easier to plug and unplug USB devices.  Also allows me to play on my device while it remains plugged in. I measured it to be sure and it is 6 feet and an inch - so they did not short me on the length at all.  I recommend this quality product.,4
It works. I use it to plug portable hard drives into. The through put seems pretty good. It works fine.,4
A good quality cable at a reasonable price.  Works as advertised.,5
"This cable works well and is a good quality product, unlike other cheap cables which sometimes affect the USB transport. I recommend it.",5
great does whats described sorry cant think of anything else to say except I hate that we have to do this in twenty or more words totally excessive,5
"It's an extension. Kind of hard to say more than that. It's a Belkin cable, so it's good quality. The ends have molded strain reliefs. This is a USB 1.1 cable, however, so data transfer speeds will be slower. But if you are using it only to charge something, it won't affect it.",5
"Instead of the pictured Belkin cable, I got a flimsy generic cable.  Total and complete rip off.",2
This simple usb extension cable seems to be very well made.  It has heavy molded connectors and a flexible insulation on the cable.  Extended my tablet charging cable and works just as it is supposed to do.,4
"Great USB cable, durable made very well.I use this cable to add a extra USB port on my desk so I don't have to bend over and plug in flash sticks or other USB devices.",5
"I use a Mac, and everyone knows Mac lovers keep their keyboards.  The one thing is that if you use a Mac keyboard, they have the shortest cord ever.  So I got this and it worked like a charm, giving me that extra distance between my Mac and my keyboard on my desk; keeping the wires off the top of my desk.",5
"I needed an extension for my wired mouse and this extension was the answer, works great, plug in and go!!",5
"With the popularity of flash drives and the inconvient USB connections on most computers (in the back or in the front that requires lying on the floor to make the proper connection), a USB extension makes a lot of sense. This one fills the need splendidly.",5
This is a staple that you must have on hand.  It has so many uses.  It is a good product.,5
"Good cable, no drawbacks, works fine, clamps on firmly, not much to add here",5
"This is the best deal you are going to find for these extention cables, great quality.",5
"This is a great accessory to use with a webcam on a Laptop computer.  My webcam would not attach and sit securely atop my laptop screen that I use. Because of this I had to position it on a nearby flat surface, but the cord was too short for my needs.  With this Extension Cable I an place cam on suitable site and use the laptop without worrying about the cam falling off, or having to constantly be repositioned.  The cable can also be utilized with other peripheral devices that hook into USB connectors. Very useful device!",5
"It's a cable, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it",3
A 2 meter USB extension cable for this price from a reputed maker is a surprise. Works well.,5
Ii needed this to expand the reach from my laptop that i have connected to the flat screen to the marble mouse and worked fine. Price was good and product is belkin,5
The cord worked great. I needed a longer cable for my Logitec mouse. The cord fit on there prefectly.,5
I had a 1996 PC that I needed to run.  It booted up and ran the display.  Unfortunately I did not have a 1996 keyboard.  This adapter filled my need.,5
Perfect if you have an older type keyboard plug and need to use a PS-2 type keyboard with it.,5
"Item that arrived was opposite gender from what is pictured, both ends.  In addition, one of the pins was badly bent--something easily fixable, but not in condition to sell.",1
Use with an opposed adapter to monitor a server with an old rack mount terminal. Worked as expected. 5 star because you can fined these.,5
It does what it was supposed to do. It works well for the computer it was bought for. thank you.,5
"Great if you need to work on an old school computer tower and don't have an adapter plug for your miniDin6 plug.As most of the old school users will remember, these adapters came with every keyboard and computer system until the motherboard manufacturers finally switched over the standard input type. It was a welcome change too!These plugs are very handy to have especially if you do any computer work such as repairs, mods or upgrades. it's a tool you'll suffer without if you don't keep it in your toolbox.",5
The package arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape. The adapter is exactly what I wanted and makes the connection I needed.,5
If you want to use your newly purchased 1984 IBM Model M keyboard with a modern computer using a PS/2 interface. :P,4
"Perfect, worked exactly as expected. Needed this to attach my Model M keyboard to a KVM switch. So happy, typing on it now!",5
Affordable and works for us keyboard nerds who love the old style keyboards. I even use this attached to about 2 more adapters and I have no keystroke loss or anything.,5
"My favorite uncle, now in his 90s, hangs on to an old 386 PC running DOS even after I bought him a new PC.  He uses both.  But he has also hung on to old keyboards he loves, including a pair of keyboards so old that they have the old PC/AT style keyboard connector.  He wanted to use one of them with his new PC that has USB inputs only (I had previously bought him a PS/2 keyboard to USB adapter so he could use his *other* beloved, only slightly newer, keyboard.)  He called me asking if I could find a way to get his old ""big round plug"" keyboard with the new PC.This Belkin F2N017 adapter was just what he needed (combined with the aforementioned PS/2-USB adapter).  I had it sent to him and he called me a few days later, with delight, saying that the adapter worked perfectly, adding that he was astonished anyone still made components for devices as old as he was using.",5
It is a good cord.  Simply packaged.  Nicely priced.There is not much more to say about a simple cord.,5
"Not really much to tell.  I needed a replacement power cord for a computer (puppies chewed the old one), bought this one from Amazon.com, plugged it in, the computer works.  As Jerry Pournelle has said before about Belkin products, it Just Works.  And the price is right.",5
I needed a replacement cord for my computer and this one works great! Very easy to hook up and at a great price!,5
Not really much to say other than it being exactly as expected. Lost the cord to my TV (moved it around a lot) and this fit perfectly. Cord doesn't get hot at the connections and fits sturdy into the plugs on each end.,5
"Cables either work or they don't. Belkin works great; it's now my brand of choice, and I don't look at any other cable other than an Amazon brand cable.",5
This extension cord is a waste of money and I feel like a tool for ordering it. I should have ordered a cheap one instead. I guess I bought the brand name instead lol FML,5
I just built a new PC when it dawned on me that I didn't have a power cable. I borrowed my printers and bought this one right away. Cheap and it works. What more could you want?,5
"A friend of mine gave me an old computer of hers, but the computer lacked a power cord.  Low and behold, Belkin comes to the rescue.  The power cord was perfect for the old PC, but would be good for a new one as well.  It never hurts to have extras on hand when it comes of cords and cable for ANY computer.Great product from a reliable company.",5
For such a low price it is great! It is true to Belkin quality-low price high quality product; can't be beat,5
"Somehow in my piles of cables and connectors I managed to lose one of these.  I bought this as a replacement for my Thecus n4100pro server but also tried it on my PS3 and Samsung 26"" LCD tv.  It worked fine on all of them.",5
This power cord fit the monitor and the outlet.  What more could I ask for?  Worth the $ if you need one of these.,5
"If its wire, I perfer Belkin. In my opinion its a quality cord. This cord is being used on a monitor and I like the way it lays. It doesn't have a mind of its own. It stays where you put it.",3
Works great! I plugged it in to my Acer monitor and image is as it should be. No cut outs and good quality.,5
"I needed another power cord because I forgot to bring it with me on a trip, so I ordered one from Amazon and got it in two days (Amazon Prime).This Belkin cord has a higher quality than the one that originally came with my PC, and the price is very reasonable.I recommend it highly.",5
Purchased these for the two hp monitors we picked up at the local goodwill.  Cheaper on amazon than buying at the electronics store and works just fine.,5
">Seriously, this is a GREAT product to have around when something ""gives out"" or stops working!  Or to leave plugged in at difficult to reach receptacles where you might use some type of pluggable device (burner, printer, or even a small desk top CPU or a monitor that you occasionally move around!).  Belkin quality here, even at this price!  My power cord came from ""TechUsed"" Company (though that name is a misnomer because the cord was BRAND NEW, in original packaging!)--shipping included.  It arrived quickly, ahead of schedule, nicely wrapped,  [Other companies compete on this item, literally different by a penny--I thought that ""TechUsed"" did well for me, and some other companies might not do as well with this or other items... just saying; from experience....]>This cord did NOT warm up or soften at the ends when used with even ""old"" (CRT) monitors and computers (addressing concerns seen concerning other similar power cords).  [If you need a LONGER, 12-foot cord, then look at the 12-foot Belkin cord (""Belkin 12-Feet AC Male to Female Replacement Power Cord"", by Belkin, sold by AMAZON)--that longer one being available here at Amazon for a little more than twice this one's price.]  Since you never know when you might need that extra length--buy both....",5
High quality material and brand. You can buy this product to replace any cable if you broke the original or if you want to use a diferent male to avoid using an adapter.,5
"This item did not work for both an LED monitor or for my desktop PC.  For the price, i'm just going to throw it away.  Although the plug has the right shape, it fits loosly in the socket of the device.",1
"Good quality, Its sort of hard to write allot about a cable but I would buy this one again.Thanks JP",5
"We needed a replacement power cord for a LCD TV. Did a bit of looking around, all of the ones we found were $10 and up, for a power cord!Not only did I find this Belkin power cord on Amazon for much less, it's a name branded, UL listed, and just a higher quality cord.After getting it out of it's package it didn't retain it's bent/wadded up form either!Pros:Cheap!UL Listed (far too many companies are using cheaper certifications).Has a good memory, i.e. doesn't stay coiled up from being packaged.Cons:Doesn't magically lower my electric bill. LOL :)",5
"Works just like any power cord should, no issues at all, bought as a replacement for one that was ran over with a sweeper.",5
"Does what it says, says what it does. You'd have to work to screw up a power cord IMO though...",5
I needed this cord to supply a desktop with AC voltage. It works perfectly. I have no complaints with it.,5
"Works like it should, and cheap as well. Worth it in my opinion, and I definitely recommend it if you need a power cord.",5
"I don't know what else to say about this product, but it's exactly what I expected and works for me. I'm glad I could find one at this price. Any electronic store would sell this for $18",5
"Good snug fit on both ends. No overheating of cord with my computer hard drive and screen...works perfectly. Good sized cord, which is average for 6 foot cord length. (Had lost my 2 previous cords). Belkin makes a good product.",5
This is the power cable I needed to use with my Desktop PC and it worked wonderfully. The fit on both ends was snug and secure. I didn't experience any loose connections that others have mentioned at all. It plugged into my power supply with just the right amount of force and it will never detach itself unintentionally. PC powered up immediately on first try - which really doesn't need to be said...The bonus - it's really cheap!,4
"Looks nice, considering it's a cable. It works well too. My only issue is that I find it a bit short, It is the correct size but for my preferences 6 feet isn't that big for cables in general. Regardless, did it's job well. I am satisfied with it. Bought 2",5
"Had enough to make it possible to get this well-priced cord. Very happy with it; Belkin makes a good line of products, at least so far as I've found.",5
Well known make to me always rated. Used a few times and no issues yet. Hopefully will last a number of years.,5
This is what I used to replace my monitor power cable that I also lost.  This way I was able to turn on my monitor.,5
"Belkin is a good brand, so I did not hesitate in purchasing this power cord. Anyway, there is not much science in a power cord. This one fit perfectly.",5
This is one of those products that either works or it does.  In my case it worked.  I used it to power a CRT monitor.,5
Product came in Belkin packaging and was the same quality as power cords that come with computers and printers.  Worked perfectly with my LCD TV.,5
"It works, it's long, it's tough, it's high quality material, my chiwawa is not going to be chewing through this. If your looking for a power cord that just does its job, then get this one. You can't find a better AC Adapter Power Cord.",5
This is a basic pc cable it works on most computers and monitors and some printers. This is way cheaper here than in Walmart or another store so if you can wait for it in the mail do it will save you some extra $$$,5
I needed a power cord for a Cisco switch I bought recently. This cord was cheap and got the job done. I'll be buying another one if I ever need it. I used to have a ton of these lying around and got rid of them. Isn't that the way it always is? :),5
"This thing is more then up to the task. This is as good as the cord that come with any computer, printer, or TV. It's a great replacement part for a good price.",5
"When, after moving a treadmill, I couldn't find the power cord, my first efforts were devoted to locating the manufacturer's website, phone number, mailing address, all the while wringing my hands in despair that my costly, indispensable machine had been rendered worthless due to the loss of a mere power cord, which certainly had to be custom-made to fit the opening designed for it by the makers of this aristocratic device (30 years ago I viewed all owners of treadmills as self-indulgent elitists).  But while waiting for a company representative to answer one of my phone calls, it suddenly occurred to me that my father had once purchased a power cord for an old TV set at a hardware store, and with no regard even toward the make of TV.So I looked on Amazon, instantly found something that looked promising (the description ""Universal"" was admittedly encouraging), and in two days both the treadmill and I were back up and running.  The pedestrian exchange (in both senses of the word) would no doubt have proven satisfying to anyone of any age, generation, class, ethnicity or gender, amounting to no less than the discovery of one's autonomy in a world of high-priced experts and ""gotcha"" specialists.  Moreover, how reassuring it is whenever one discovers and comes into possession of the knowledge that previously had no doubt belonged to everyone but your own isolated, ""out-of-the-loop,"" lonely self.  I hesitate to say whether the cord was more empowering to me or the treadmill.  But don't be shocked if the product delivers what it promises--twice over.[Since writing the above, I've discovered a company (Essential Sounds Products, Inc.) claiming its power cord is ""Amazing,"" ""Innovative,"" ""Revolutionary""--that after using it to supply power to, for example, an amplifier, the cord's owner will settle for nothing less (""One listen, and nothing else will do"").  This possibility sort of blows my tribute to the universality of the common power cord, but I remain to be sold on the new, revolutionary product.  If it converts my television set to ""Smell-o-vision"" (for those of you old enough to remember) or my kitchen toaster to a turbo-charged forge suitable for alchemy experiments, I'll be persuaded.  Return for updates.][Argh. The ESP (the acronym for the manufacturer) power cord begins at well over a hundred and the power strip at five hundred.  I smell exploitation of musicians (and gearheads) who, like athletes, are sometimes willing to try anything for that winning edge. Better to buy this Belkin and, if it bothers you, paint it some other color and put an exorbitant price tag on it so people will think it's one of those elitist A.C. cords.]",5
I recently acquired an old desktop from a friend that didn't come with a power cord. This arrived quickly and works well (at least for the week or so that I have been using it). I don't foresee any problems.,5
Ive got a rabbit and she decided to . Worst part is it sat there for a while and I didnt know it. One weekend I decided to pratcticeeat my power cord for my amplifier was chewed up. What did I do? I hopped on Amazon and bingo I found a new one that was a good deal (6bucks with shipping) and I ordered a new one. Two days later I was back in business. All I can say is &#34;That's what I.m talkin about,5
"Nothing special here, we needed a few spare power cables for some PC's and Monitors that went missing and these fit the bill perfectly.  No issues, cheap, and work great for various 23&#34; LCD's and XPS 8700 Dell systems.",5
"Exactly what I needed to get my LCD monitor working again. For buyers, this is interchangeable with many desktop computers and other monitors, so buy it with confidence.",5
"We bought a couple of these to replace our cords to our monitors because we had European cords...anyways, these are just as good quality as the originals and dirt cheap here on Amazon, so it was a no brainer. Perfect.",5
bought it to use as an extender but it wasnt for that and even so I kept it because it will be used for something,3
This cord is amazing. It feels great and fits into most monitors. It is also made by Belkin which means a lifetime warranty and quality product. And its cheap!,5
Extension Cord was needed to make my Computer monitor stretch farther to my Desktop unit. Fast shipping and works great. No problems after 6 months.,5
"These work great when chaining lighting and speakers. I found these in red, blue, and yellow on Amazon, they are different colors and legnths. I wish they made 10-15ft in colors. That would be great. Having the color allows you to know how long you're grabbing!",5
Simple need and this product delivered.  Great quality too and very heavy duty.  Connections are solid with no worry of accidental disconnect.,5
"When I rearranged my office I discovered the power cord from my computer monitor would no long reach my battery backup. An extension cord was needed. I have used Belkin products before and have always been satisfied so I didn't hesitate to order this online. I received it in only a few days and it worked perfectly. The plug ends fit snuggly and the picture on the monitor is as good as it was before I added the extension cord. And at a great price, too.",5
Some Belkin branded products are overpriced imho but this Cable in particular is a steal.Hard to find in stores and if you do find it expect to pay 2-3 times the price.,5
Choose this product from a reputable mfg. to try and extend my computer reach before making a permanent installation in my home.,4
"It's an ethernet cable.  It's fifty feet long.  It works.Need more?  Well, I like that the plastic molding at the connectors doesn't slide down the cable.Still need more?  Buy it if you need it.",5
"It is an ethernet cable. What is there to be said? It is cheap, and it works fine.",5
It fits. It works. It was priced right. I bought it. What more can I say about it? Still need 2 more words... sheesh...,5
"Great value if you just need a regular 50 ft. ethernet cable, and you don't care about the color, etc.",5
"I saw the same exact cable at best-rip off (oh I mean bestbuy) and it was 40 bucks more.  Buy here, be confident, the wire is just as quality than the one you'll get at best buy.  Im am extremely happy with this deal. I paid 12 bucks for a 40+ cable, doesnt get better than that.",5
This is a great buy if you need to run the wire from one room to another.  The brand is good and the quality is there.,5
"I ordered this cable from Sewell Direct. I received the cable in generic form. It was not packaged by Belkin. It did not say Belkin on the cable itself. It came in a plain plastic bag. My cable at home has Belkin imprinted on it, enclosed in Belkin packaging. I returned it to Sewell. They promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs. They should specify this generic or bulk packaging, so that I do not waste my time ordering from them.",2
"Cable was delivered promptly, product was as described.  Used it to connect a second computer to a router ... connections worked with no problems.  Connector ends appear to be sturdy  enough that I have no concerns about connecting and disconnecting this cable over time.  Considering the price, this is a good value.",5
"I bought this exact same cable in the 25 foot length a couple years ago and was very pleased with it, and needed a longer length for my new setup.  So I went to look for a 50 foot length of the same brand, same model (as it were).  Found it (this one).  Ordered it.  Received it.  Opened it.And then it hit me.  THE STENCH!  The cable I got REEKED of chemical, plasticy, rubbery odor that was HIGHLY unpleasant.  This wasn't the case with my 25 foot cable!  Perhaps they cheaped out on the jacket?  Or just simply changed suppliers?  I have no idea.  But, if you have a sense of smell at all, avoid this cable.  I ended up buying a Dynex 50' cat 5e ethernet cable from Best Buy for too much money.  What can I say, I needed it right then.  Something very similar is sold on Amazon for a lot less, but it doesn't look exactly the same (although it probably is).  If it IS the same, then I can tell you that the Dynex cable does not smell at all and is a very nice and flexible cable which feels like it has some kind of high quality jacket material.Buyer beware.",1
What can I say?? It was a great price on a 50 ft network cable and it works great!! Will buy again if needed.,5
The cable is of good quality and had worked without problem.  The terminations are easy to plug in and remove.  There have been no performance issues with this cable.,4
I received this item in record time I dont know How these guys do the item for such a low price. Why buy unknown makes names when you can get the real thing for less. Thank you and I will surely buy again and reccomend. Wish you every success.John,5
"I have the tools needed to make my own Ethernet patch cables, but for $12, I opted to just buy this 50' cable and be done with it. The cable is high quality and the connectors are strong and molded in. So for less than 25 cents a foot, I have just what I needed.",5
After receiving this cable I immediately plugged it into my router and my 360 and was up and running. Just what we neede for Xbox Live. Seems to be a high quality cable.,5
"It's a cable, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it.",4
"I have an old PC in the basement that runs as a file server; instead of buying a wireless card, I picked up this cable and ran it from my router up into the rafters and down into the front half of the basement - with cable to spare. It does just what it claims to do - gives you 50 feet of CAT 5e cabling glory. :)",5
"This cable performed perfectly.  The data transmission speeds were every bit as fast as I had hoped, and the cable was not bothered by being in direct sunlight.",4
"Its a 50' ethernet cable that I got for so low a price it bugged me for a bit... I got over it. This cable is well made and works as described.Now the SELLER, on the hand, was incredible! I got the item in three days brand new.",5
There's nothing to it...The belkin network cable worked well right out the box. Its solid construction produces good signal conduction. So far I have used it to download firmware to my BD player. Great product. Worth every penny.,5
The cable connected my computer with the blue ray dvd player to give me access to Netflix.  It worked flawlessly.,5
"Don't go to Best Buy and pay that 200% mark-up. These cables are just as good, if not better. You won't be disappointed by the quality, and the length available here for a fraction of the retail price makes them a bargain.Frankly, the big box stores should be ashamed that they mark up items like this so much. The real quality and bargains are found online, with items like this one.",5
I needed to connect a blu ray play to a wireless across the room. 50ft belkin cable worked out great for this task and now i get all my BD live stuff.,5
I set this up and have been using it for a while now. Excellent quality and was able to run it throught the floor boards to my PS3 for a faster network connection.,5
"A regular long ethernet cord that shows no signs of wear. However, it does not catch in ethernet slots (it sometimes slips out).",4
"Belkin A3L791-S 50-Foot RJ45 CAT 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable worked great for my computer, without any problems. We have a wireless Internet/connection in the house now, but I keep Belkin A3L791-S 50-Foot 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable...",5
What can one say about an ethernet cable? This is well made and works properly when plugged in. Reasonable value and I will order Belkin cables again,5
"Rarely do you find such a good deal on such a typically overpriced commodity. Why should a simple cable that's used by billions of people be so unreasonably expense usually? Well, the answer is because they can get away from it. In this case I felt like I paid what I should pay. Good price and the product was everything I needed. Shippiing was pretty darned fast too. Recommended",5
"THIS BELKIN QUALITY CAT5 IS WELL WORTH THE SUPER ALMOST REDICULOUS LOW PRICE.IF YOUR WIRED AND NEED LENGTH,THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.EAT CROW RADIO SHACK!",5
Not much to say- works as needed; cheap.Will buy again if need. Recommend.,5
"I just needed it to work (connecting PS3 and router), and it does, 5 stars.",5
"This is the 2nd time I've used Belkin Cat5's, I have some shorter ones and needed to change my router placement. I've also used Belkin HDMI cables and I think Fiber optic cable as well. I've never had any problem with their cables so far and their prices are reasonable...",5
I like the snagless feature and easy coiling for storage of this cable. I get it out when using my portable in a wired network and then coil it up and stow it in the case.,5
"Usually it's better than average,but this one is not as good as I bought before. I have quiet few Belkin's items and I like /trust this brand. Everything would be fine if not for the cheap plastic plugs ...If ur intend to unplug/re-plug it often, than I recommend other brand-Belkin screwed up on this one;) Thought it's cheap-don't like it-throw it in the garbage.;)))",4
"The pink cable was like $1 when I bought it, so you really can't beat the price. Its a pretty standard cable and it works just fine. The connectors are pretty good, the only negative I have is the little plastic guards that protect the tab on the connector are fragile; if you push them sideways very much they come right off. But honestly you don't need those ( they can even be annoying in tight spaces), and for $1 the quality can't be beat!",4
Some days it is better to just buy a good cable like this instead of putting your own ends on a bulk cable. Very reasonably priced and a quality product.,5
This was exactly what I needed. Thanks for great product and great price. The product is sturdy and works well.,5
I ordered this as a spare so I have not used it yet.  It does appear to be of good quality.,5
"It works as I expect an item from Belkin to work. I needed a few extra cables to connect some home theater components to the switch box for the router, these do the job quite well.",5
"Shipped immediately to me, this patch cable is worth way more than I paid. Very good quality.  Excellent customer service as well. Excellent Value and Product",5
"These cables rock, I got a bunch for my dorm room, and they work perfectly and do what I need them to do.",5
I am pleased at how well this cable works. I use it to hook up my XBOX to my router in order to get greater speeds for streaming video and it doesn't disappoint.,5
I have no complaints pertaining to this cable.  I particularly like the molded connector feature.  It's always a personal fear of mine that my wires and cables will fail at the connector due to cheap construction.  I doubt that will be the case with this cable from Belkin.I also give kudos to the pricing.  I simply cannot argue with $3 for a 7 foot CAT5.,5
Secure snug fit great colors price is definetly right!  Get what you order at your door with minimal time usually 2 days,5
I bought this cable and it worked well.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for products sold by belkins.,5
great quality cable . What I mean to say is it is well made and has decent insulation tonot disturb the flow of information between that and your modem.2nd Finally able to color match some of your cables so they actually add to the look of your rig or ambianceI would reccomendthese cables,4
"Works very well! It has a nice length to it. For it to have been SO cheap, it really gets the job done. It doesn't fall in and out of the ethernet slot. It stays right in place.",5
Don't care about color the cords are hidden. Just like the high priced store cables. Great packaging. Why go to BB when you can get these.,5
"These Belkin network cables are well-made, and they do the job.  Of all the colors available, the gray is the least expensive, and blends in well.",5
I got this cord for under $5 and it lasted almost a year before the plastic ends broke. I unplugged and replugged it in one or more time a day and was satisfied with it for how much abuse I put it through.,4
What can I say- it's a CAT 5e cable and it works exactly as described- no problems. For people who can't deal with making our own cables- like me.,5
This item worked as expected and the price was lower than other suppliers.  I have had no problems with this item thus far.,5
"It's not the prettiest cable in the world, but it's well-made and it does what it's supposed to do. I can't really ask for more.",5
Its a patch cable. I hooked my xbox and dvd player to my router and can now access the internet on both.,4
"These Belkin category 5e cables are well made. They are a good overall gauge thickness and the snag less ends are very beneficial. You may have experienced the problem of untangling a phone cord, only to have the clip on the end bend over or worse yet snap off. The next time you use that cord it doesn't have anything to keep it in the wall. Well what Belkin did with these snag less cables was put twin ridges made out of a rubbery plastic, that puts the snap in clip in a valley down below the ridges. So if you are untangling, those ridges prevent other wires from snagging the clip. That is a great idea. That is not enough to make you want to buy the cable, if it weren't for the fact that it is overall a great cable. The seven-foot length is good for a small patch area, like when connecting your modem to a router, or when your cable or DSL modem and/or router are right next to your computer.The other nice thing is the price here at Amazon on these cables. I went into the local nationally famous office supply, and they were half again as much money. So overall it is a very nice combination. They also don't slow down your connection at all. I get the same exact connection speed when using the online speed tests when I use the 50-foot, or the 7-foot.Highly recommended. Buy it here at Amazon and save the money.",5
I'm using the cable to connect a router to a desktop. It works fine,5
Good quality cable. I used it to hook my HDTV to my router and have had no issues. Would buy again.,5
The is an extremely cheap and one of the fastest commercial cables you can get. Totally worth the money. Look no where else.,5
"this was just the right length, color, and price for us, came in retail packaging and works fine for us",5
The quality of this cable from Belkin seems to be good. They fit my router and are easy to install and remove. I have had trouble with some Ethernet cables in the past so I bought 3 different sizes of Belkin  and they all worked great.I even tested the cable and it was fine. I'll definitely buy these again in the future.,5
I used this cable to hook up my BluRay player to a Ethernet switch.  It was inexpensive and works great.  Would recommend it.,4
I needed a few of these for various internet enabled bits of kit and a few of these did the job and weren't overpriced for what it is.  Works fine!,3
"Good enough price, nice ends, good sheathing.",5
I returned it because the network adapter which I purchased in conjunction with your product didn't function well with my HDTV and my modem. I would have kept it had I had another use for it.,5
"You can't beat the price, but if I were to buy one in the future, I would get a 10 or 15ft. I bought it for my bedroom and 7ft is pretty short to reach everywhere I want.",4
"""Snag-resistent"" would be more accurate: a pair of flexible plastic ""ears"" guard the release lever that is the bane of normal CAT-5 cables, but those ears can bend down so that the lever is unprotected.  Otherwise, it's fine, and the price was right.  I will buy more of these when needed.",5
"This cable was exactly what I needed, and the quality, price, and speed of shipment was terrific! The type of cable was the perfect speed, and complimented the rest of my system very well! All I can say is Thanks!!!!!",5
What can you say about a patch cable?  I chose the Belkin product because I have used Belkin for many years with no failures of any of their products.  The products are reasonably prices and Belkin has always maintained a high level of quality.,5
It's Cat 5 cable with an RJ-45 on each end.  What else is there to say?  It's portable and works.,4
"What can I say, it's a ethernet cable, nothing special except for maybe the snagless ends. Cable is well-built from a reputable brand at an unbelievable price. Great connection, doesn't come loose from my router (or the wall). Also comes with a lifetime warranty so if anything goes wrong you're covered.",5
Fast Ethernet cable built to last.  Bought this as an extra cable in case I needed it.  Works like a charm and is a great asset to have.  You can never have too many cables.,3
"Connects my PC, and my xbox to the internet. I cant think of anything negative to wright works well for what it is.",5
"Good cable. It is nothing special, but does everything I need it to.",5
"They sent a different product.  Does not say that is made by Belkin anywhere on it.  They sent me a RJ45 cable made by FOXXCONN #E204149.  This does not have the protected cover 'snagless' over the release lever, as shown in the picture/item description.  I'm not happy; I do not plan to buy from this company again.....",1
Pros: Cheaper than any Brick and Mortar. Snagless design is nice. Let's me get on the interwebz.Cons: Hasn't made me a BLT. Belkin should incorporate this into their next CAT 5e design.TL;DR: Buy it,5
"Cat 5e cables are Cat 5e cables, for the most part. But quality does show when you compare the lowest quality products to the highest ones. This cable has solid sheathing and well built ends which will probably last for many years even in somewhat abusive situations.",5
"I got 5 of these cables in pink, since amazon was offering them as an add on item for a discounted price. I chose pink because it was less expensive than any other color by at least a dollar. So far they have been working perfectly, as most cables do.",5
I needed cable for specific purpose and and specific length and color. This was perfect and I would recommend to everyone,5
works great,5
"7 feet, just to warn you all, unless you know for sure that the things you're connecting are gonna be close, could be a little tight, especially if you're going around a desk or something.Looking for cables? Go with Belkin, go with snagless. You'll save yourself a lot of grief.",5
"I can't complain too much -- it's cat5 cable, what's there to say?  It's a good price, and I like being able to get various colors because it helps with cable management.  But this cable had a different sort of plastic sheath on the connector head than I am used to and I do not like that at all.  In order to press the plastic release for the connector, you have to fit your finger between two raised edges.  Clearly this is to protect the release from the common breakage problem, and I appreciate the attempt...but this was too hard to use: couldn't release it with my thumb, had to use my index finger.  Plus you can't do it from the side, you have to have your finger at the correct angle, which can be a problem when you're under a desk with your hand snaked around behind your router or what have you.",4
There were needed in my computer/TV setup.  They arrived on time.  And they seem sturdy and well made.  Note that they are a full 7-Feet long.,4
Came on time as expected - thank you Amazon. Works as expected - thank you Belkin. What more is there ? Plug it in !,5
Once you see the price of these in stores you will appreciate the great prices here. Ordered two of these and they work great and the snagless feature is a real plus. Ordered two more to keep for back up. The different colors are nice also for identifying different computers or whatever you are using.,5
"It works and it's 7 foot long.  What more do you want from a 7 foot Ethernet cable.  Wifi is great, but there is no substitute for hard-wiring in when I am playing StarCraft II.",5
"Not much to say about ethernet cables. I wanted a mix of different sizes as I rearranged my office, and it was easy to find on Amazon.com.",5
Needed a shorter cable to hook things up around the TV to a router.  Cable is good quality and works perfectly fine.,5
"They are inexpensive, flexible, and work just fine.  I'm just using them in mundane applications.  Don't know how they'd work in high speed applications.",5
"It's a cable, it transfers data. Not much else to say about it. The price was right for the length that it was and connects my new desktop to the router.",5
"Simple, made sturdy and hooks up my mac and PS 3.  Would recommend to anyone and inexpensive.  Great buy all around.",5
It does what it's supposed to do...and well,5
"I bought the pink 7ft cable and really like it.  I took it to a workshop where no wireless signals were permitted (radio telescope workshop.. obvious reasons for that necessity), and everyone had ethernet cables and it was just a mess with all the cables and trying to figure out which went with which laptop, etc.  But, thanks to this distinctive cable, I didn't have to be concerned with any of those issues--or with my cable magically disappearing! (which seemed to be the fate for a few of the many, many mundane blue ones).",5
I cannot recognoze well how 7-foot long because I'm Japanese and the peoples other than US use metric unit. It doesn't wrok for my intension because too short!,2
"Belkin products are usually a good bet.  This isn't complicated, it works fine and is what I expected it to be.",5
Used the patch cord to connect my modem to a switch then from the switch to two Rokus.  Good price and fast shipment.,5
"I'm so sick of most local stores overcharging for cables.  I always try to buy my cables online.  Sometimes you don't really know what you are getting though.  This one worked perfect and I would not hesitate to buy again.  Good cable, good price!",5
"This Ethernet cable works great and is cheap!  I think this is a good size for most purposes.  It's not too long where it gets tangled up, but not so short you can't use it.  I like the way it latches in; this is a nice feature compared to other cables I own.",5
"It's a good cable.  The only thing I would change on it is to make the snagless attachment more like what is on the Cables to Go 27150.  It's just a better design, but this one still does the job.",4
"We bought two of these, basically because they were the cheapest 7 foot cable I could find on Amazon.  We've got other Belkin equipment, and have been happy with it.  But, to be honest I didn't expect much for that price.  I figured it would be cheaply made, toothpick size cable, or the end locks would break right away.  They were actually a pleasant surprise, especially for how cheap they were being sold.  Can't complain a bit.",5
Great cable.No problems or issues.Does what it needs to do.Not expensive.I've bought many Belkin products with no complaints.,5
"Great cord.  Does what it's advertised to do.  Can't beat the price and loved the color options, specifically the purple.",5
"This cable was exactly what I needed, and delivered very quickly. No question that you will be happy with the purchase ... if you need a 7' cable.",5
"I bought two of these to connect my TV and my surround receiver through an ethernet switch to my router. Plugged them in, everything worked (Netflix, internet radio) and never looked at them again. For that price you can't make them on your own.",5
what you would expect from belkin.  these are high quality CAT5E cables and they work great to connect all my devices.,5
"works great, the snagless head is good when you are pulling through areas so you don't snap the clip off the end.",5
This is a standard cable and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I am happy with the purchase.,5
"this cable works and is cheap. the tabs haven't broken off after extensive use, and the rubber shield covering that extends up onto them for the &#34;no snag&#34; feature might be responsible for that, though it seems to be decent quality plastic (not super brittle) on the connector too.",5
"Bought the 7 ft gray cable: Good price, works as advertised. The snagless feature is good to have since I have broken the plastic latch on other cables in the past. Highly recommend.",5
Good quality for your money. You don't have to spend more for a similar prodduct as this one. 5 stars.,5
"Well, its simply a cable...not much really to say about it, other than it works and its size met my needs - having different colors helps, that was the major reason behind this purchase - various cables to same location (or even different locations I presume), all have different colors making identifying them easier when necessary (couple times now, removing cables, checking link lights, etc.). No problems since purchase though!",5
its a cat 5 cable good quality and seems to work well is kind of short though make sure you measure the run that you will be using it for before buying,5
It came on time and the cable works.,5
"works as designed the price is just right . I will  recommend this item to my friend ,it works with the proper length.",4
At this price its probably a knock off but it shows 100M across so I don't care.  I guess the snagless clips are pretty nice too.,4
it works great..,4
"Needed a couple of cables for a project I was working on and once again Amazon had the best price compared to most of my local merchants.  These worked, and are still working great for my application.  Thanks Amazon.",5
"Ahhh its a network cable... Works as expected, would give it 10 stars if it could talk to me but since it cant 5 stars will have to do. LOL",5
Does the job I got it for at a stellar price. No complaints. Buying from Amazon saved me money. I would have paid a lot more had I gone to Radio Shack or Best Buy.,5
"This cable was exactly what I needed, and the quality, price, and speed of shipment was terrific! The type of cable was the perfect speed, and complimented the rest of my system very well.",5
"I bought these because they are purple.  Good quality cables for a good price.  Really though, they are purple, and that's why I bought them.",5
"The cable works as advertised. The connection is fast, and gives me no reason to be dissatisfied. A cable at this price cannot be beaten.",5
"What can you say, it is a CAT5 cable, has quality molded connectors, works, and was cheap. I carry 2-3 with me on trips to plug into the connections at my hotel in various lengths, and Belkin always delivers with quality cables.",5
This cable came at a good price and works flawlessly. I used it to increase my download speed by using the ethernet connection instead of the much-slower wireless. What more can you ask for?,5
Works beautifully.  Now I get to sit back and bask in the glory that is fast internet service from my modem to my router.,5
You could have paid much more money for the exact same cable. This cable works as well as one you might pay two to three times the price. Recommend the product and the vendor.,5
Works great... it is just ethernet cable.  nothing special but perfectly fine as long as reasonably priced.  Seems to be well built and solid.,5
I bought them to replace the ones I have in use that have broken clips. Next time I pull my computer mess err desk apart I will replace them.,4
It's cable. It works. It wasn't expensive. Why do I need so many words for such a simple review? One more  word argh,5
"RJ45 cables are so common these days, you'd think everything would be worked out by now... apparently not so.The worst thing you can do to any electronic cable is kink it, bend it sharply, put a crimp in it. But my 7 footers, shown on Amazon in an appropriately nicely formed loop, all arrived in a tight wad with sharp bends every 3 1/2 to 4 1/5 inches along the entire length, and then tightly bound in the middle with a wire tie. Each kink even created a discolored joint on the cable jacket. Cables don't like sharp bends (mine have 17 tight bends along a 7' cable), those kinks make cables hard to string and route along small spaces, they make a rat's nest behind my comm gear, and they jeopardize the integrity of the cable.C'mon Belkin, your ""Pro Series"" packaging is a silly gimmick, because at a thrifty $2.50 per cable, I'm betting dollars to donuts there's nothing special about your cables, no rare metals, no exotic coatings, no braided stainless shielding... it's a generic Ethernet cable. Nothing more, nothing less. Kindly treat it as such. Treat them kindly and fore go the glitzy packaging.Meanwhile, my 15' cables from Mediabridge happily arrived in a simple cardboard box, in a neat 5"" diameter coil. No kinks, no sharp bends. I try to order from Mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box, no fancy packaging, no rocket science, no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks, just a sound cable. Unfortunately, they did not have 7-footers when I needed them. So I went with Belkin, after all it's just a cable. Next time I'll wait for Mediabridge to re-stock.",3
It's ethernet cable. It's the right size. And it didn't cost an arm and a leg. The connections are well made. Would buy again.,5
"Bought these to connect my router to all my home theater stuff. Rasberry pi, etc. Love the vibrant off beat colors.",5
its a jumper. cant say much more than that. works. nice quality. went from switch to internet ready device. ok.,5
"I'm guessing the ""snagless"" refers to the tall curves on either side of the clip on the ends of the cable. These tall tabs on both sides of the clip make it rather difficult to push the clip down when removing the cable, at least in tight places where you're limited in how you can twist your hand. Meh, no big deal. The price is good, the black looks really darn good, and they do their job just fine!",5
It does what it's supposed to do and it does it well. Fits perfectly and the casing is high quality.,5
"I bought this to link my cable router to my bluray player for streaming video.  Works great, seems to be a high quality cable.",5
The cable did it's job. It arrived on time and was as expected. I needed a CAT 5 cable to hook another PC to my network,4
It is nice having a 7 foot cable as opposed to the usual 6 foot. It worked out perfect with how I routed the cable to the PS3. Looking forward to more great shopping on Amazon.,5
"Fast shipping and this is a good quality item. Simple to install, does what it is designed to do with no complications!",5
"Ya, this thing is pretty cool. I bought it to connect one electronic thing to another and to my surprise, it worked! Data is being transmitted as I type this thanks to this cord.",4
After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.,5
"Use it with my new docis 3 modem and wireless router, works like a charm, gives me great speeds. Does exactly what it's advertised to do.",5
"I'm not sure there's a whole lot you can say about network leads, but I'll try anyway:* It worked* the covering on the cable wasn't cracked anywhere* The RJ45 connectors were intact and undamaged* I liked the grey, it really brought my room togetherYeah, that's about all folks.",5
Middle of no where. my wireless card went out. At that time I did not even know what an Ethernet cable was. However it got me up and going. With simple instructions off of YouTube,5
There is not much to say about cable it works or not this 5e cable worked for my purpose it delivers my full Broadband speed of 300mbps to my devices,5
Basic wire. Works. Too pricy for a basic part made up of wiring and plastic. Not much more to say.,5
"The price on these cables is great.  So much cheaper than most stores, and they come in many colors so that you can use multiples.  Packaging is easy to use, and completely frustration free.  Would buy again.",5
Then why do you have to spend 200% more for it in a store than online.  GREAT quality and price.,5
Yet another example of Belkin getting it Right! This is not a unique length-it's the right length. Printers or other devices that are not immediately adjacent to all the other equipment need this length. Another great product at a good price by Belkin.,5
I bought this and plugged it in and have been using it without issues ever since. I'd buy this again.,5
"What more can I say than it works and was inexpensive!  I generally get my cables from monoprice, but this is good, too.",5
"No issues with this cable at all. The ends hold firm in my switch, and have survived about a half dozen unpluggings/repluggings. The molding around the plug is strong and the cables flexible. Will buy again if need more",5
the product just works just fine. One thing you'll notice about quality ethernet cables is where the insulation stops on the ends of the cable. If you're cable is filled with the plastic on the ends(like this one) you're getting a pretty good quality cable.,5
"Exceeded the use for what  I needed .... Very good cord for the price .... The &#34;5e&#34; is for extra heavy duty wire gauge.Hooks up in a snap and doesn't come out of the plug unless you need it to...... The end plug is made with very good quality.... Thanks for sending it to me the way you did,  I received it one day before the promised date...",5
Good wire to connect my ROKU to router. It enhances the speed as it is fast as compared to wireless connection,5
I bought this product after doing a lot of price comparisons and reading reviews. I am satisfied with it. The cable is of good quality. I use it to connect my wired Trendnet Broadband router to my laptops.,5
Not much to review here.  They were inexpensive CAT 5e patch cables.  They work just fine.  Construction was fine.  I would have no problem buying these again if I needed more patch cables.,5
These arrived in good condition. They have worked fine for my needs. It's a pretty straight forward product and I think Belkin does a nice job with it.,3
Seems to work fine and quality is comparable to products from electronics stores.  This was half the price so that makes it a great bargain.,5
This cable does what it is supposed to do. It works! What more can be said? It is well made and performs to specs.,5
They worked fine and are well made. It's a cable but now I have to add 13 more words - there!,4
"Needed this for my computer and it works just as I need it too. Nothing more, nothing less. Would suggest to anyone with a computer.",5
The snagless part is really nice. Most any problems I've ever had end up being broken ends and this type seems to solve that problem.,5
It's hard to review products that work as expected.  A 7 foot cable for less than $3 can't be a bad deal anyway.  This works as expected and was very inexpensive.  Grateful!,5
"I love the price and free shipping with prime, this cable was a great buy and if i ever need another cable I will buy this one, I love the different ranges in length also. all around 5 stars on this product",5
These are well made cables with good features such as the molded guard for the release lever to keep it from catching when the cable is pulled back out of an  installation.,4
"This cable did what it was supposed to do, and was a great price.  I did recently upgrade all of my cables, including this one, but not for any reason in particular.",3
"I bought 4 of these so i could connect everything around my tv to the internet. (Xbox 360, Playstation 3, DVR, and a computer)These cables are great, they are high quality, and have sturdy connectors. They are gigabit cables.I stream 1080p .mkv files from my laptop to my Xbox 360 via Windows Media Center, wireless N does not cut it, but these cables do the job.Even though I doubt I will need speeds over 100mbps, I like having gigabit cables, and I like these cables better than the cheap blue ones on amazon. The cheap blue cables have weak connectors in my experience, and have broken off.I would definitely recommend this cable.",5
"I actually ordered this Belkin Ethernet cable for it's certified status and did receive a new (packaged) Belkin Ethernet cable. Plus, the price was the lowest I've found for this brand name cable. Of course, it's working fine. It's manufacture and durability appear among the best. Don't get me wrong, I use and am happy with the generics too...only difference seems to be the thicker construction of this Belkin brand. I expect unparalleled performance and longevity from this cable.",5
"It is as advertised and works extremely well. Construction is above the standard. Before there all gone &#34;Get One, NOW!&#34;",5
Good Network Cable. It looks reliable and made of good quality plastic.I wish I got a longer one though.,5
"What can I say? It does what it's supposed to. No drama. For applications requiring a cable more than 3 feet, but less than 12. You know that, but I needed the extra words to fulfill review guidelines.",5
"I love purple and this is really purple.The cord is good quality and I am happy, have gotten a few more since.",5
"They work just like they should.Always go for the snag-free design, so the little clippy thing doesn't break off due to your carelessness.",5
"I don't no if their is much to say about a Ethernet cable, but it feels like it has a solid build qualities. I have had no problem with the cable. I would recommend this item to anyone.",5
This is a quality product at a great price. Works like a charm. Should last for a very long time,5
"Does what it is supposed to do, with no snagging among cabling. Quality product with sturdy construction and flexibility, and a nice gray color.",5
"I ordered this cable to replace a nice red 7 footer that will work with my LAN hookups, but notmy Line 6 Spider amp to peddle connection???????????.... Go Figure.The cable works great, and I don't have to use the 25' cable Line 6 sent me (25 feet?).I ordered three of these, as every once and a while I need a shorty to run from wall connection to router, or router/wall to computer.It works great, and I have posted a photo of it, as one reviewer said he got a fake, so this is what it looks like in the package.",5
Belkin 7-Feet CAT5e Snagless Patch Cable (Gray) arrived before the due date and it was pachaged well. I sure like the color issue. All my cables are colored and I log them in a note book for easy access.,4
I like the snagless connection feature.  Otherwise it's your basic Belkin Ethernet cable for home or office networks.  It's good.,4
"I really like the 'snagless' feature on this one. I've broken off so many of the little clips on other ethernet cables. I think this will be much better protected. The length is good. I can sit in an easy chair near my desk with the laptop, and the cord reaches, but it's not so long to be cumbersome when I'm working on the desk.",5
I have used this product on multiple devices and some of them dont seem to hold together as well as others.,3
"Just after buying a new computer (Dell), I realized that it would be a good idea to replace my modem to computer (Cat5) cord. When the cords arrived, I connected them then logged on. Could not believe the difference. I was using an older blue cord that I picked up from a family member. I ordered this cable because I wanted a longer cable, but was really happy and pleasantly surprised  with the increased speed. We have SBC DSL Elite, and everything is so much faster with the new Belkin Cat 5. I recommend this Cat5 cable.",5
"It's a CAT 5 cable, you use it for networking. There isn't much to say besides that I suppose, but it's very good for the low price.",5
"There is nothing bad to say about this cable.  I bought three at once.  They aren't the exact ones shown in the picture, or at least, the ends look different, but they still have the ""snagless"" design, albeit a slightly different one.  Still works just fine as far as functioning as an ethernet cable.  I used it with my TrendNet ethernet switch, with no issues yet whatsoever.",5
It's ethernet.. as advertised. Snag protectors work well. No complaints here; would buy again. 6 more words required required required.,5
"Great Cable.  This cable is very rugged to use, the tab protectors are great since is really protects the tab.",4
Snagless cables at an affordable price. Just what I needed. The connector head was solid and felt like it had a good build quality.,5
"It's hard to go wrong with a Belkin product.  They always do what they're supposed to do and for a reasonable price.  It's hard to be too picky about a cable that plugs into your modem and computer, but it does seem to stay un-kinked.",5
"No complaints about this cable. Functions perfectly, and is exactly as described. Used for connecting desktop computer to an ethernet switch.",5
it is a great cable and easy to tell witch one goes where i highley recomend it to everyone it will not snag on anything,5
"Exactly as advertised and shown. Nice quality, ""snag-free"" (meaning it has a molded ridge on the cable end to help try to avoid snagging the port clip), and fully molded (not crimped) cables. A good buy, especially with Prime shipping.",4
"Works well! I needed a shorter cable that would not get in the way, but allow me to move away from my desk (7 Foot). I can enjoy higher speeds with this CAT 5e cable connected vs my wireless connection. I like the snagless design it offers good protection from tab breakage.Belkin International, Inc., is a American manufacturer of computer hardware that specializes in connectivity devices, headquartered in Los Angeles, California. I feel all warm and fuzzy supporting a American company.I have purchased Belkin cables in the past and i still have a few of their cables laying around they are still working after years of use. I have some missing tabs on a couple of my generic CAT 5e cables. This is the reason for my interest in Belkin's snagless design. Without the locking tabs the cables slip out if moved.",4
I bought several (five) of these so my network cables would match and each of them work perfectly as expected.,5
What can you say? It works perfectly and is of high qulity.,5
"there's not a lot to say about this cable but I've got to try since there's a minimum word requirement for this review - the cable is good, its the right length, it works.",5
always go cheap for digital cables. i found this same cable at Wal-mart for ten times the price. no difference what so ever.,5
This is a nice cable with dual ears to protect the tabs from breaking. They work like they should which is good. They are a little pricey for what they are. Also note that the color is not the same as in the picture. These are light gray in color not Dark Gray.,3
I brought this cable when my old cable broke. I'm use it to connect my computer and wireless route together. It's a good cable.,4
It was really cheap and shipped quickly. Not too much that you can say about a cable except that it works. I needed a second one and this one did the trick.,4
"Hey, it's just a CAT5e cable and it seems to work as intended.  I didn't test it to see if it would work at Gigabit speeds (which a CAT5e should) but it works fine to connect my network-attached color laser printer to a local Ethernet switch.",5
"I got this cable to connect my laptop to the internet occasionally as the wi-fi is pretty bad.The wire didnt look or feel like new and out of the box.I saw that there were bends and it felt cheap.I was going to return it, but it gets the job done and has no loss of speed.So for the price there are not a lot of complaints.",3
"New, does the job and arrived on time. Why would you pay two or three times more at an electonics store? Amozon is the place for all your cable needs.",5
Just what they siad it would be and it works just fine. The color helps to see which item is pluged into which port.,4
"Solid, well built product.  Does the job.Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.  Hate word length requirement when a few simple ones will do.",5
Very good quality cable for a good price. I bought this for my desktop computer and they work great. The clip is not flimsy like most cables.,5
"I have a HTPC and even though its rare sometimes I do need to use a keyboard with it.  I had a large print keyboard that is so easy to see in a not so brightly lit TV viewing area that I wanted to use.  Got this cable and routed it from the PC, around the back of the TV, and that puts the keyboard at a comfortable location for typing on.",5
This cable is NOT available in any store in our area so BIG thanks to Amazon for making unusual items like this readily available to everyone everywhere. Keyboard cables are too short and this was exactly what I wanted. Being tipical Belkin quality is obvious immediately & it works perfect. Does not have that flatspot to plug into tower like the keyboard does so I marked the missing pin space with a majic marker on the cord to make finding the proper alignment easy to find when you want to plug it in again.,5
I needed to work on an old computer and needed more PS2 link.  Works as expected as an extension cable.,4
"Needed to extend keyboard for older style desk. Six feet was clean, simple, and perfect fit. Cable flexible enough to move well without being so stiff it hangs up.",5
This was a must have for my windows 95 keyboard! I enjoy the classic keyboards and this made it that much easier to use!,5
great cable.  works great and was plenty long enough for my purposes.  Belkin is a great brand for this kind of stuff too,5
This is just an extension cable to be used for a keyboard.  Most keyboards today have very short cables and this fixed the problem.  You may want to tape the two cables together with electrical tape to prevent them from pulling apart but mine had not pulled out so far.,5
"I needed this for my old computer, which I use when I want to pretend it's still the 90s. I had a slight fear that the extra length - my keyboard's already long cable plus this one - would cause problems with the strength of the signal, but everything's fine. And how sweet it is to finally be able to sit at my desk, far from that computer, without a keyboard cable stretched across my monitor screen.",5
"This extension fits into my older PC's PS/2 port better than the cable from the keyboard! The connection is snug, but not too tight. It works just as well on my new self-built Win 8 computer. I've got an old keyboard that is really great, so I'm using it alternately for both computers.",5
"Work as they are supposed to. I sit about 5 or 6 feet away from my monitor, so these are perfect. I go through to many batteries in wireless keyboards and mouse's, so this has saved me tons.",5
"If you want a longer cord on an older non-usb keyboard, this extension cable works great.Keyboard plugs into it snugly and wont fall out easily while moving it around or lightly tugging on it.",5
"It's Belkin. What more to say? Nice tight connections and it works. Probably will have only wireless mice soon, but this was handy when I needed it and it didn't give me any problems.",5
I have two of these connected together to extend my keyboard from the computer.  I would definitely purchase again. Thanks.,5
"I use this to connect an old PS/2 keyboard to my HTPC, and it works fine. I bought this to replace a generic brand that wore out, so hopefully this name brand will be better.",5
"The configuration of my office made it impossible for my cpu and monitor to be close enough together to use the existing cables. So, I purchased these extension cables and they work beautifully. They were the exact same product as sold in stores for 3 times the cost and there is no loss of function. I would recommend this product to others needing just a little more length in those cables.",5
"again and again i find stuff on amazon for far cheaper then in store. We have best buy where i live and have to go there for parts. They are so overpriced that i have stopped going there and am more then happy to wait for belivery. I am a pc gamer and play on a 55"" in my living room. I had been using wireless keyboards but they always were haveing range or interference problems so i bought this cord. More then enuff length for me to use my keyboard anywhere in my living room.",5
"don't quite understand what I need to say about this product, it's an extension cord, it extends the distance between the motherboard and the keyboard and/or mouse.",5
"Not much to say. Belkin makes good products in general and this is one of them. I have purchased several of these for home and at the office. They work fine for both mouse and keyboard. I still use one of them (in conjunction with a USB to PS/2 adapter) for a USB mouse too, because that way I can use the PS/2 mouse port on my older computer and free up one of my USB ports, which I don't have enough of.",5
and it's screw handles are ribbed and very easy to grasp.Nicely constructed.,5
Well built. Thumb screws are very ergonomic. I use these cables with standard external modems like the USRobotics 56K faxmodems. Good value for the money.,5
What more can you say. It works like expected. The cable didn't appear to be cheaply made and all hardware interfaced using the cable worked perfectly.,5
This is a decent cable for the price.  The connection of the cable to the connector is rugged and will resist breaking easily.  Cable is well insulated and connectors are of typical Belkin quality.  Have used this in several environments including in the lab setting with satisfactory performance.,5
"Just what I needed to allow my users to connect to our CNC machines from their laptops.  Great price, I couldn't make them for this price.",5
"This is basically just a DE-9 to DB-25 adapter. It has the normal RS-232 specified pinouts on both ends, so it should work with almost anything. It will not work with things that use a proprietary pinout, such as point of sale (POS) machines. We use these for factory hardware and label printers.",5
"I bought these almost three years ago. But you know what? They're still hanging in my bar putting out good music. Well, I play the good music. These just happen to perform the actions needed to make that sound audible. But that's beside the point. Look, they're not like super bass-heavy subs. They're just well balanced affordable speakers that sound great in a bar. They get plenty loud and they look plenty good. I have mine mounted up on the ceiling and hardly anyone notices them. UNTIL THEY GET THEIR DAMN FACES ROCKED OFF. Should have paid attention, suckas.",5
"I installed these in my garage and am very pleased with the sound and clarity.  A salesman at a big box chain electronics store tried to talk me out of them, but for $30.00, you just can't beat these speakers.  They are easy to set up.  Anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker for a garage, patio or for a secondary stereo system would be very happy with them.",4
"I used a pair of these speakers to set up what I called a ""bubba vision"" cheap home theater in my family room with an old Sansui receiver, an inexpensive DVD player, and a JVC 27"" TV.These worked very well, and were a considerable improvement over the speakers in the TV.  However, it wasn't soon before I felt rather dissatisfied with them.  Not unhappy, but just aware that I was listening to a very well built but ultimately cheap set of speakers, so I resold them.However, I also own a pair of the AudioSource LS200 speakers.  They cost even less than these speakers, and to me have a bigger and warmer sound.  I'm still using those and plan to be for quite some time.",3
"I bought these speakers for less than $20 and am very impressed with their quality. I put them on our patio and the entire area is filled with great sound (the patio is about 15'x30'). If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers for outside, this is your pair.",5
I bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool.  I am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box.  If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit.  I am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage area.,4
"I bought these several years ago for listening outside on my 3 acres of property....4 speakers for my backyard but I can hear these from the front yard and when I'm in the woods too. I bought these as a cheap unknown brand speaker that I could use and abuse while leaving them out in all weather conditions...rain, snow, ice and a few hurricanes through the years and getting knocked around by kids. The sound quality and sound output surpassed my expectations. The overall construction surprised me too as they lasted several more seasons than I thought they would (6 years now and all year long outdoor usage). Due to the fact that I crank up the volume very high for when I'm mowing, or deep in the woods or having a crazy pool party, with or without other people  :)  ....  I'm now looking into buying a replacement for one speaker that seems to be on it's way out. It still puts out sound but poor quality compared to the other 3. Just a good all around speaker that does not break the bank.",4
These speakers sounded great but I do like to crank up the occasional KISS or VanHalen and these speakers just stopped working. I've never blown a speaker before but I guess that's what happened.,2
"My brother and I bought a set of KLH 970 speakers  8 or so years ago for my father to replace some old larger speakers in his house, and they are the best value speakers I have ever seen. We liked them so much we got a second set to replace the other set of speakers on his stereo. These little guys really deliver a great range of sound in a small package.  It's not suprising to me that KLH is still making this exact model this many years later.  You can't find another 3 way sound speaker at this price.  Also, they are durable and are weather resistant. I don't recommend leaving them on a patio in a monsoon or a blizzard, and the black doesn't make good friends in bright sun, but you can mount these to the porch or patio roof/overhang and leave these out in damp weather with no loss of wear or sound, at least not as of yet. The more I looked around at different facilities with PA or sound systems outdoors, the more I have noticed these speakers being utilized.  So if you have just a few bucks and want to some aged speakers, this is the perfect little set to get.  Everybody thinks bigger and pricer is better, but I have to argue that these speakers have done their job superbly, and thats why my dad still uses them 8 years later. This 970 set of KLH speakers are actually Identical speakers to the 980 models, but run a 5-40 watt range whereast the 980 series runs 10-100 watt range.  So don't break the bank if you want a set of small speakers, I think you will be suprised. Note, as with many small speakers, if you are a bass sound fan, then you might want to buy a sub-woofer, but these do a fine job at normal range.",5
"to me, Kensington is a name that project 'trust'.  this was priced right and works great.  good cord length.",5
"I love this!  It comes with matching tags.  We always have a mess of cords over by our tv.  Between all the components it is iimpossible to tell what is what...not anymore.  You just tag it with the matching color, up by where you plug it in.  I love this, and it comes with a great warranty, which also sold me.  Worth the little bit extra, IMO,",5
"I have these all over in my house!  They work great!  I had one for many years that I paid over $50 for but I got my money's worth for sure!  So when I was able to see these on Amazon for less money, I was happy!  They work well, they allow you to plug up many things and move freely.  The cord from the power strip is average length but it does the job!  I would recommend.",5
"Purchased six of these for use in our store. They are durable, with an 8 foot grounded cord.Amazon's 2005 product description indicates 1260 joules protection - 2010 model has 520 joules @ 330 clamping volts.Will certainly purchase Kensington surges again.",5
"This is a great power strip.  I use it in my office and there is enough room between each plug that it doesn't matter how big the plug next to it is, it does not interfere.I also really enjoy the design and colors.  Having a quality item that also looks great it just an extra plus in my book!",5
This surge protector is super cute and can handle your tv and other big items. I bought two of these just because it's awesome looking. lmao,5
This is a brilliant product. It's so helpful to not have to tug and pull and guess which cord is which. I love that they added tape so you just put matching tape on each end of the cord and pull the cord into the coordinating plug.,5
I got this strip because I was living in a mobile home and wanted to protect against surges on my computer. This did just that.,5
"With two very young children, our outings can be very unpredictable. Time is tight too. The Motorola 280's have been a great time saver. Sometimes we  split up in the mall. One of us goes to do some shopping while the other  has fun with the kids. We don't have to worry about setting up a time and  place to meet up. It's easy to ask a question or change/make plans from 1/2  mile away. We use it on hikes and while walking around the neighborhood.  They're also great when you are travelling with more than one car.The  range is supposed to be about 2 miles. It can differ depending where you  are.Everything I've said is a good reason to by any 2-way radio. Why did  I choose this model even though it costs a lot more than some of the other  ones?-They're compact. Even more compact than the the 280's that take  regular batteries. Their size makes them easy to bring along anywhere. They  also have a removeable belt clip. Clip them on your pants or belt or remove  the clip and they slip easily into your pocket. -They're rugged. The 280's  survived drops onto pavement and gallons of baby drool. -They have 14  channels and 38 privacy codes. If you go somewhere where there is a large  crowd, you will run into other people with radios. The extra channels help  you find a quiet channel. However, we rarely have to change  channels.We've had ours for almost 2 years now and they have been very  useful.",5
"For the price, and the brand name, Motorola's FRS radios should be more durable - these don't last long in average use (either business use by IT professionals, or the real torture test, with pre-teen boys).",3
"If you have children who like to roam, then the Motorola TalkAbouts are essential equipment!  I have used them to keep in touch with my children when they have played in different soccer fields, when they ride their  bikes in the park, when camping, picnicing and hiking.  The units are easy  to use, even for a 5-year-old.  It makes them feel important, too, so they  willingly keep in touch.I have found the TalkAbouts to easily withstand  the rigours of active pre-teen boys, and the reception has been good, even  in built-up areas.Battery use is reasonable, the units are tough and  easy to use.Any parent will find a use for these!",5
"My husband, young daughters and I own horses, and trailride at least once a week. Santa brought us four of these lovely little two-ways this year at Christmas, and I couldn't be more pleased. We've had none of the troubles noted in the other reviews, (although we don't ride on mountaintops), and my children find the radios simple to use and easy to understand (not to mention the cool factor!).The radios are durable; we've dropped them in snowbanks, had them grawed on by curious horses, and thumped around in saddlebags. They're certainly useful, we know if one of us gets separated from the others they'll be able to radio in and figure out where we are. And for what we use them for, they're just perfect. We looked at a bunch of GPS handhelds, and decided we didn't need anything quite that high end. For the average family who hikes or skis, trailrides or just goes to the Mall of America, these are the perfect belt accessory. Go for it!",5
Fabulous product - works great - highly recommend - have used on my friends boat and it is great when we are on shore and need some one to come retrieve us - also works great on the boat that is 168 feet long,5
"Iomega ZIP 100 Drive Parallel PortThis device has been in use since the mid-1990s. It allows both storage and transfer since it works on any parallel port, which should be defined as ""bi-directional"" or ""EPP"". For best results, you should run the ""Parallel Port Accelerator"" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The ""User's Manual"" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega ""Copy Machine"" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega ""Format"" function. Use ""Short Format"" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The ""Long Format"" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. ""Write Protection"" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as ""non-removable"" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. Most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first (""daisy chaining""). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: ""SCSI controllers"", ""Iomega"", ""Iomega Parallel Port Interface"", then ""Finish"".",5
"I have had my Zip drive for almost 3 years and it has worked great.  Although the performance of the drive has been great I find that the media to be too expensive and much larger than the comparable LS120 drives.  Another suggestion is your buying this drive to use it for fast access to  your files, don't go with the parallel.  Instead go with the internal IDE  or the SCSI.  Both of these are at least twice as fast as a parallel drive.",4
"I have a 486 that I use this drive on. I am so surprised at the speed that it reads the info through the parallel port. I had heard that the parallel port could be slow with a ZIP drive, but it seems to work about the same  speed as an ATAPI drive I had preinstalled on my PII 400Mhz. The price is  right for ZIP drives. Don't bother with the 250 MB drive - disks are more  and not enough people have the drives yet that support them.",5
"I have enjoyed the convenience of my zip drive-  My university's graphics computers have zip drives, the local Kinkos have zip drives in their computers, my parents even have a zip drive now.  Its a nice, accepted standard, and for the price the disks read fast and work well- unlike 3.5  floppies, no zip disk has ever corrupted data for me. Zip disks are made of  sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your (shirt) pocket without  damage.The strongest competetitor to the zip disk standard is the 120 MB  super-drive, which is a drive that is backwards-compatible with 1.6 MB  (traditional)3.5 floppies, so you can totally replace your old floppy drive  and still have it when you need it.  A couple years ago it was expected  that this drive would blow Iomega zip out of the picture, but  super-floppies haven't really caught on.In terms of exchanging data  between computers in the same house, it is suprisingly simple to run an  ethernet network instead- and there are other advantage besides transfering  files- such as printer sharing and web sharing.-Note.  I think the zip  100 is more functional for the price than the 250 zip. -(For backing up  really large files, the best thing these days is a cd writer or re-writer.)",5
"this thing is now just a blue brick in the corner of my room. i tried to download the driver from a website but no such website exists. i could download it from the from pirate bay, but that's illegal and unsafe. so i have all these pictures of dear family members (some of them are dead), and i can't retrieve them!",1
"I'm a Mac user, but I also have a Windows PC in my office. My workplace has over 1,000 employees and the majority of them are on Windows, while I am one of 3 people in the organization that consistently uses a Mac.I am sent files all the time via the Network GroupWare e-mail system. I never wanted to hook my Mac up through all the logging in and everything involved in a Novell system, so I never got the Mac version of the software to connect my Mac fully to the network.So, when someone sends me a file via GroupWise, I copy the attachment onto my ZIP disk and then eject that disk and put it in my Mac to work on the file.  Not the most efficient way to go about things, but this 100MB Iomega ZIP drive hasn't failed me once in the past 4 years.Since the Mac OS can read both Mac and PC ZIP disks, I use PC formatted disks and move them back and forth from Windows (the Parallel drive) to Mac (the factory installed 250MB drive) all day long.ZIP disks can hold an equivalent of about 74 floppy disks and the speed is lightning fast when compared to floppies. My only gripe is that Iomega does not make these drives with an on/off switch... even if your computer is off for a week, you've got to unplug your ZIP drive if you don't want it to eat up electricity. Honestly, I doubt that a little ZIP drive that isn't spinning a disk uses more than a single kilowatt hour per month, but it's a waste nonetheless.  This one gripe wasn't enough of a drawback to take a star away from the 5 star rating I'm giving this gizmo.  It's dependable, it's fast and ZIP is an industry standard. Hats off to Iomega.",5
"This device has essentially been eclipsed by its own success.  Now the solution-of-choice only for older machines (more than 2 years), or for mobile professionals who want to make absolutely sure that they'll be able  to connect a ZIP drive to any PC they encounter, this most basic ZIP drive  should be avoided by most purchasers.Fact is, if you need to be mobile  with your ZIP, you should go the USB route these days.  Every new PC and  Macintosh comes with USB connectivity, and the difference in access speed  is great enough to justify the minimal extra cost.  This parallel port  machine is the very slowest ZIP drive available.  If  you download files of  any size (1M or more) you will notice the difference.You'll also notice  the difference between this model and an internal model.  Make sure that  you really need to be mobile with the drive itself before you choose an  external model.  As has been stated in other reviews, the ZIP-100 has  become something of a standard nowadays, and many machines come with a ZIP  drive pre-installed.Also, even though the price is attractive, think  carefully about choosing this model if you plan to do much printing.  Most  printers use the parallel port, and although you can hook up both a printer  and this drive to the same port, you can't use both simultaneously.  This  is disasterous if you attempt to print a file from the ZIP drive.  It can  be done, but it takes a lot longer than printing from other drives.  Also,  forget about accessing the ZIP drive if you've sent a print command.  Your  parallel ZIP drive will be unavilable for the duration of the print.Having said all this, I absolutely agree with other reviewers who praise  the ZIP-100 format.  It's got the broadest-based installation of any ZIP  format, so chances are you'll be able to port your data more successfully  with a ZIP-100 than any other format.  True, 100mb is starting to look like  small, but it's still an awful lot of room for almost everything but  full-motion, full-sound video.Still, I have to give this product fewer  stars than it would've deserved two years ago, simply because Iomega has  come out with better stuff in the interim.  For many users, it would be  wiser to buy an internal ZIP-100.  Or, better still, buy an external USB  ZIP-100 for current compatability, and leave the internal bay available for  future installation of a JAZ-2MB.  That way, you'll create a removable  media solution that handles both past and future needs.",2
"The Zip100 is a minimum necessity for today's larger and larger file formats - MPEG, MP3, and multiple images files can easily run up to 100MB.  I've used the Zip since its inception when it knocked old Syquest 88MB  drives out of business about 5 years ago.  The size and convenience is why  there is really only one choice for removable media with easy and immediate  read-write capability.There are definite pluses and minuses.  Some will  say get a CD-R(W) drive - but burning a CD is definitely not as immediate  as a Zip. The parallel port is a major bummer because of the thru-speed.  But those of you who are not major speed demons won't be disappointed  compared to a floppy.  The Zip drive allows daisy chaining so you can  connect/output to other peripherals.Iomega cut cost on the power  on/off (it's always on when plugged in).  But really the overall design is  very good - you can place it flat or vertical.  Even though the thick  parallel cord may tend to twist the main unit.There are a plethora of  other Iomega choices.  And I would really ask yourself if you are planning  on USB or SCSI - each are noticeably faster.  On the plus side, the 100MB  format is so common in print shops, university labs, and copy places that  you can't go wrong.  Plus the price of each disk is recognizably less than  the 250MB.  Seriously think about your file formats.  If you plan to do a  lot video - you'll need to go with a Jaz.  And you can get these  refurbished for about the same cost and hold 1Gig.  The only barrier to  entry is the SCSI necessity and the extra cost of disks.  Overall, the  Zip100 has been a major workhorse for me - back and forth between work and  home/Mac and PC MS98/NT.  It has performed flawlessly.",5
Best buy.  Excellent quality.  Thinest case around.,5
"This slim case will give your palm quite an elegant touch. It is also lightweight and compact, and it will store your Palm, as well as some business cards and/or credit cards. I personally preffer the hard cover,  which has a more modern look and protects the Palm better. Nonetheless, I  use the slim leather case when I go to elegant social events because it is  slimmer and less heavy, so it is easier to carry in your coat pocket.",4
This is a nice case.  Bought it for my dad's M515 and out of the box it didn't fit because the stylus insert is too large for the accessory slide but he was able to modify the case so that it does fit.  He likes it!,4
"This is a decent case for carrying your PalmPilot.  A lightweight metallic case with hinges might be better.  Actually, I don't know anybody that carries this device and I haven't for 10 years, but the case was good.",4
".If you have a Palm V or Vx this is the case to get.The Vx is a  classy looking Palm. The case makes the Vx into a Porche.  The combination  of the two is terrific-- performance and looks.There is one problem  with turning the power but a software hack fixes this.A great gift  idea for an intelligent businessman or woman.  The more you use these t  devices the more you will come to depend on them.If you want to use  this as a wallet, it is a good option.  I like to keep my wallet trimmed  down without a lot of junk.  This is not a real wallet so you can't  accumulate junk in here.The Palm Vx complements this in that you can  quickly enter whatever receipt information you might normally accumulate in  your wallet-auto records, expenses, etc.  And toss those out or if you want  to keep them dump in a monthly file folder.I strongly recommend the  combination of this wallet and the Vx.",5
"I have used this case for almost 7 months and still having difficulties when trying to put it in my shirt pocket.Forget about putting some credit cards in it, because it gets thickerI gives a lot of protection for the Palm, but it affects the best characteristic: SIZEI have been alternating this case with the original cover, depending the ocassion and the clothes I'm going to wear (in order to carry it in a comfortable and practical way)",3
"This was the first case that i had for my Palm.  There is no doubt that it a good case and it looks really nice with the Vx. With the case on, it very little to the overall size of the palm. The silo design of the Vx which allows you to attach the case to the palm was ingenious. It a huge leap in case design compared to the velcro concept of may PDA's.As for this case it is made of high quality leather and it a loop/strap design that i also liked. Velcro and the button proved that after prolonged use, it tends to rip. The loop/strap design secures the case very well and it still looks very elegant.However like many leather products, they tend to warp and deform after a while. Just think of your wallet and how deformed that can get. If your going to be putting it in your pocket a lot, i suggest you go with the hard case. However if your going to be putting it in a bag or brief case, then this case will be fine.Although the case has slots for credit cards or business cards, realistically you wouldnt want to put more than two credit card and 3 business cards in it at one time. It does a lot to the bulkiness of the case. Personally I only carried 4 business cards in it at one time.Reatively speaking i wanted a case that was smaller then this one because it got a little too big for my pockets, whether it be the shirt or pant pocket. i found that not only was the hardcase by palm smaller and almost weighed as much, it also protected it just as well.Also the fact that the powerbutton was often times turn on when using the leather case convinced me to change to the hard case.Dont get me wrong. I really like this case. The hard case just fit my needs for a case a lot better then the slim leather case.The best thing i can suggest is to try both of them out before you actually buy it. A lot of stores will let you try on the case. Thats really the best way to determine which one will really work for you.I wonder if this will fit the m500 series... hmmm....",4
"As a heavy user of my Palm (which I access dozens of times a day), the Palm Slim Leather Case is perfect for my needs.  I prefer it over other cases for the following reasons:The first is portablity.  I take my Palm everywhere with me (even to the little boy's room).  And with the case's slim size, my Palm fits easily into my front pants pocket.  (Carrying my Palm in my shirt pocket is also an option.  But since my company switched to business casual attire, I no longer wear dress shirts with pockets to work.  Hooray!)The second reason is convenience.  With the Palm rail system, the unit is held securely.  And when I need to sync, the case slides off cleanly (the rail system being a simpler and much more elegant solution than the pocket or Velcro holding methods of other products).The third reason is protection.  The rigid cover is slightly padded, and the loop closure is very secure.  (Before adopting this case, I once used another cover -- without a loop closure -- which failed to protect my Palm when I accidentally dropped it in the street while I waited on the curb for a cab.)  The loop closure is also easy to open, so access to my Palm is not restricted.My last reason for selecting this case is its ability to hold business cards.  I put my business cards (a whole slew of them) in the large inside pocket, and I put my kids' doctor and dentist appointment reminders in the multiple credit card slots, none of which I want to carry in my wallet (which is already filled with plenty of other stuff).  Since my Palm is always with me, I'm never without a business card, so I never miss an opportunity to have my name remembered by the many new customers or vendors I meet.(As a comparison, many of the hard cases are very stylish.  But since they can't carry business cards, they aren't really adequate for my needs.)For a great combination of style and function that's perfect for a heavy Palm user like me -- the Palm Slim Leather Case is ideal!",5
"I got this case because I had two needs.  I wanted to protect my Palm V from the frequent falls out of my front coat pocket; but I didn't want to significantly increase its size and weight.This case fits both bills  nicely.  The added bulk and texture of the leather holds the Palm in your  pocket for that split second necessary to grab it before it falls; and when  it does fall, even if it lands on a corner, the screen doesn't crack.  Just  what this doctor ordered.I use the pockets to store a couple of cards,  nothing more.  Works like a charm.  The clasp is sort of odd, just a tab of  leather slipping into a buckle.  A snap or velcro would have been nicer,  but so far it does hold closed on its own.The leather smells nice and  has been wearing well.  The little Palm logo embossed on the front is sort  of cute, too.  Overall I'm happy with this case and the price is certainly  right.",5
The quality of the product is excellent except that it serves as a big impediment for when you charge on the Palm cradle.This won't fit inside the Palm Cradle.,3
"Unlike my other reviews which usually take up a page or so, this product is rather straight forward.  First and foremost I must say that this case sure beats the hell out of the hard case, which is also manufactured by  3Com, in both form and function.  Second it can hold credit cards and money  to be used as a second wallet, although it is not a great idea to use it as  a primary substitute.  And thirdly, the hard case is about ten dollars more  than the leather case and is not nearly as good.However, like all  things, it does have it's downsides.  It's biggest flaw, like with other  cases, is that it makes placing the Palm in the craddle (while still in the  case) a little more difficult.  You basically need to place the craddle up  on something (upside-down cup for example) and pull back both sides of the  case all the way and then you can recharge.  Secondly, the pockets are made  so stiff inside that it is very tricky to get both money or credit cards  into or out of the pockets, which is why you might want to stick to a  regular wallet.  And thirdly, if you place the cased palm in a tight space  like a bag or something, there is a chance that the edge of the case will  hit the power button and cause it to turn on.  This is not a big deal since  it will shut off automatically after a minute or so, however it can become  annoying when you haven't charged your palm in a while and you find that  your battery is dying for some strange reason.All in all, you can't do  much better than this case for only $19.95, and while there may be more  expensive cases on the market, they are all variations of this simple  design.  However, I would say that it would be nice it 3Com or Palm would  make a case like this that went all the way around the palm for protection  on all sides, since something can get caught between your palm and the case  and end up scratching the screen (which almost happened to me).Final  thoughts: nice leather, don't expect it to take the same beating as the  hard case, but unless you plan to go hiking with your palm, don't shovel  out the extra ten bucks for a shoddy hard case, get this nice leather one  instead.Revuman:  Stay Tuned for more Reviews...peace!",4
"Nice looking, good feel. But my rail pulled off the rubber binding after 6 months of light use.",2
"One of the nice features of the Palm V is its slim size.  If the manufacturer of this case would leave out the credit card/cash pockets, it would definitely be a plus.I have not had the accidental turn on  problems others have had, but I think when the case softens up a bit after  use this could be a serious issue.  I've got friends who switched over to  the hard case, which isn't as &quot;sumptuous,&quot; but fits well, will  not accidently push any of the buttons, and is a bit thinner.",4
"This product does its job: Which is to protect the Palm. (They can, and do, break, you know, if you drop them without protection).The strap holds the Palm in the case securely, as does the ingenious snap-in docking mechanism. There are slots for two or three credit cards and a side slot for some cash. But this only works as a wallet in a pinch.On the down side, the case does roughly double the depth of the Palm Vx, but the way I see it, that's the price of protection.",4
"IOMEGA ZIP 100 Portable USB DriveThis unit is identified by its translucent light blue rectangular box. It uses a separate power supply. The Model Number is ZIP100USB. It can operate either horizontally or vertically (like a floppy drive). A device that connects with a USB cable requires Windows 98 or later. You should use the software EJECT command to remove a ZIP disk in Windows 2000 because the disk caching system may have data that needs to be written out. The IOMEGA software should be installed in Windows 2000 instead of the built-in support.The ""User's Manual"" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk.

Replaceable 100 MB ZIP disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology. But the 100 MB ZIP disk is almost as universal as the floppy disk when you have a parallel port drive for older systems. The ZIP disks reuse deleted space unlike a CD whose space is consumed when you replace files. Falling prices for CD discs solved that problem. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'.

"I bought my first ZIP drive (parallel port) a long time ago, and replaced it with a USB/AC-adapter model a while later. I am still using it, and it works. The disks have a higher failure rate than the drive, but hey-still working after all these years.",4
"Was sort of perfect for my needs:  Using an obsolete storage system to take obsolete writing files from an older MAC and copy them to an eMAC.  I then had to convert to a current word processing software, OpenSource.Org and then my intent was to plug this Zip Drive into my iMac and copy all those newly translated files to the iMac. But for some reason my iMac couldn't &#34;see&#34; or read the Iomega Zip Drive (it &#34;saw&#34; it at the USB Hub). So I had to buy a flash drive to copy those files from the eMac. Then I was able to copy to the iMac from the flash drive.  (Their Customer Support said the drive had been tested through MAC OS 10.6 and it worked fine [have 10.7.5, Mountain Lion]).  In a round about way, the technology served its purpose!  Thank goodness.  (The Seller was quick in responding to my questions.  Good Customer Service.)",3
"I bought this to read some old Zip disks I had lying around. I wanted to save the old files. I bought my Zip drive from third-party seller ElizabethLeeHR and even though it was used, it ran on my Win7 laptop flawlessly. No driver needed; pure plug-n-play! Of course, Zip drives eventually all develop the click-death syndrome, so I can only rate this 4 stars!",4
"This is the perfect product to back up file, photos, Vieo Clips, MP3s. Great performance, fast transfer rate, not very noisy at all comparing to an LS-120 I own. I recently bought a Zip 250MB, and so far it's get my thumbs up! Full compatibility with the 100MB disks. If you want a portable storage device put your money on a Zip drive. CD-R &amp; CD-RW media are great. The only drawback is the media being used over and over. CDs aren't a very reliable comparing to cartridge disks. Cartridge disks are more reliable and last longer in the re-write processes of everyday backups of your files. And keep in mind that the Zip drives or less expensive and are easily transported anywhere, easy to install and work with. A+",5
"Mine's been working flawlessly since I bought it in early 2000. I understand the newer models are bus-powered. If for some reason you can't have a power strip, that's a concern, but I do wish the AC adapter was smaller.Gotta love the way it shoots non-Iomega zip disks half way across the room, too!I recommend this drive for low-cost, low demand storage and backup. Now if only zips would come down in price...",5
"I had backed up a legacy computer on ZIP disks and stored them away.  (I now use thumb drives and CD-ROM.)  When I needed some old material from the old computer, I could not read the ZIP disks without getting a new drive.  This convenient USB ZIP drive was just what I needed.  It was shipped promptly and in excellent condition.  It saved my life on this occasion.",5

No one however who answered had ever actually tried it in Win 8.The software for this drive took down Win 8, and I had to do a reset to get it to restart Windows.  Major flaw.IT DOES NOT WORK IN WINDOWS 8,  ACER COMPUTERS.I have applied for a refund.Update:  I tried to load it after the fail on Win 8, on a laptop I have with Win 7.  After loading the software, Windows would not start, and still will not.  I would not try it on Win 7 unless you know what to do when it won't start.  I have to have mine repaired, and minimum repair is $70.  That's a high price to pay for just trying a product that was defective.",1

I don't quite get the  translucent blue case (oh yeah, it works with the Mac, too) but other than  that, no complaints.  Now that is high praise, indeed, these days!",5
"As it makes little sense for the 100mb to be the original Zip you put on a  new system anymore, most people who buy this product will probably be  upgrading from an old parallel version.  To be sure, it is an improvement  on that device. It's noticeably faster.  But it's smart for only a couple  of  very specific kinds of user.The first is the ""Backup Bandit"".  If  you only use your zip drive for routine, automated backup of files that fit  easily onto a single 100mb disk, it's unlikely you need much more than this  device.The second is the ""I've-had-a-Zip-for-years Geek"".  If you have  a huge library of Zip 100 disks already amassed, and the average file size  is above 10mb, then there's an argument to be made for staying with this  product.  Notice that I'm talking here about a library of truly BIG files,  typically graphics.  If all you have is a massive library of text  documents, you shouldn't fear switching over to the Zip 250 at all.In  my opinion, anyone else should go for the USB version of the Zip 250, and  add on a FireWire adapter when it becomes available.Why?Well,  the Zip 250 USB with FireWire is simply the most flexible Zip out there.  You can use it on literally any system that has at least USB ports, can  achieve the lightning speeds of internal SCSI Zips if the computer has  FireWire ports--and you don't have to sacrifice a scrap of portability.  While the Zip 100 here can be fitted out with a FireWire adapter, it can't  use Zip 250 disks.  True, the Zip 250 is mysteriously slower than a Zip 100  if the files are something above 10mb.  But you'll never notice the  difference with the vast majority of files.  What you will notice if you  spend any time seriously archiving your work is how nice it would be to  have a little bit more room on a 100mb disk.  The Zip 250 solves that  problem by giving you a lot more room to play in.  In particular, the 250s  are obviously better-suited to sharing larger multimedia files between  computers, or even between platforms.  Finally, the 250 simply LOOKS  cooler.  Those looks even translate into utility, because its trim profile  really does make it a little easier to carry.In fairness I should point  out that the 100mb appears to have a substantially lower price tag.  But  it's not, really.  You pay on average 1.5 times as much for Zip 100 disks  (per megabyte of storage space) than for Zip 250s.  Long term, your storage  savings with a Zip 250 more than make up for the up-front difference  between the two models.",3
"If you're like me and have a digital camera that uses compact flash and a laptop that always has a free PCMCIA slot, this is an excellent value.  Leave it in your slot all the time, it won't have an effect on your system when the CF card isn't in, but it will permanently add a CF slot to your system.This means that you can dispense with the camera-to-computer cable and just plug the card into the slot.  When you do, it will be recognized as a removable disk, kind of like a Syquest or Zip disk, and show up in your &quot;My Computer&quot; view or Mac desktop, and maybe (this is how Nikon View works anyway) pop up your digicam software.This really is by far the most convenient way to deal with a digital camera if you use a laptop.",5
"I plugged this adapter into my new Dell Laptop and it brought up my CompactFlash card as an additional hard drive in Windows 2000, no software or additional drivers required.I was then able to browse and even edit pictures on the card as if it were a disk drive. Truly amazing. All peripherals should be this easy to install and intuitive to use.",5
"CF readers with USB cords? Why bother? Say goodbye to those bothersome cords! This CF adapter is the answer to keeping your portable computer PORTABLE. One little adapter allows you to plug in your Compact Flash cards for quick and easy reading. I bought this item when I purchased my latest digital camera and it has been a blessing! It's so simple to use, light-weight, compact -- and incredibly inexpensive! How simple? Plug your CF card in one end, plug the adapter with card into the appropriate slot in your laptop and the computer is ready to read and write to the CF card just like it was another drive. How sweet is that?",5
I use a viking 128Mb CompactFlash card in my Canon S200 digital camera. Simply plugging the card into this reader and the reader into the PCMCIA slot on my Mac TiBook automatically launches iPhoto and imports the contents of the card into the laptop. Much faster and certainly more elegant than carrying around cables and using the camera battery.  Highly recommended!,5
"Adapter works fine -- laptop is 5 years old, but everything worked fine.  Good price at Amazon.",4
"It works fine under Windows ME, 2000, and XP, because you dont need drivers, I read a bad review for this item, and let me tell to the autor: or you have an old windows version(98 or 95) or you need to contact support, but not for this device, you need suport for the CF card developer, because this its just an adapter.Its faster than usb readers(max 12mbps) and of course really more faster than cable connection from the device(1.2mbps), the speed limit its the speed of youre CF card(more than 12x its great).",5
"I just plugged it in and it simply worked -- both on my PowerBook 1400 running OS 8.6 (which exploits it as an extended memory hack) and on my Titanium PowerBook running OS 9 and OS X. I have iPhoto set NOT to launch when the card is inserted on the TiBook.I gave 4 stars because it arrived quickly and did the job as advertised with no hassles. (To merit 5 stars, it should have had better documentation and a more detailed troubleshooting guide).",4
"This adapter works great for quickly moving digital images from cameras to your pc.  The only problem I have with it relates to the overall length of the card.  They should have made it 1/2 inch longer so you could remove it more easily from the PC card slot.  When inserted, it is &quot;flush&quot; with the PC.",5
"It does what is says it does, the only downside I can think of is, that it does not have an eject button for the CF Card, so when the card fits tight, you have to remove the PCMCIA Card to actually get the CF card out.",4
"This is a great little piece of hardware. I have used mine in both a Dell Latitude running WinXP and an Apple Ti800 running Mac OS X. It is the only way I transfer pictures now. Much easier to carry than a USB cable, plus it is faster, does not use up the batteries on the camera, and just flat out works perfectly.Here is how I use it :I take my picutres (duh ;-), remove the CF card from the camera and insert it into this adapter. Then I insert it into the laptop. Under both Windows and Mac, the CF card appears as a removable drive on the computer.Under Windows, I navigate through a couple of folders to where the pictures are stored and copy them to a folder on my hard drive. On the Mac, iPhoto automatically opens up (because I have told iPhoto to startup automatically when a camera is connected) and it gets ready to transfer the pictures. I can then tell it to copy the pictures to my Photo library, and delete the originals. It does just that. Then on the Mac and PC, I tell the operating system to eject the drive/device, then I can pop the adapter out of the computer. Of course you can pop it out whenever you want, but you will definitely risk something bad, better to eject it the proper way. I can transfer a full 128 MB flash card to my computer is a minute or so. Fast enough that I haven't timed it.So, I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses CF media with a laptop. It is the way to go!...",5
"This device was the second wind my old Panasonic digital camera needed. I connect the camera to the laptop with a serial cable wich makes it to slow (No USB cable), so I tried this inexpensive alternative in order to revive my old camera wich still works perfectly. I needed a way to download the pictures from the CF card to the computer. Now, I can download in seconds what usually took hours.",5
"This Compact Flash Adapter work's great. All you do is snap you compact flash card into it and slap it into your Slot and bam! It is also much faster for me then hooking up my Digital camera to the computer using a USB cord and AC/DC adapter (saves on batteries). Faster in the hook up time and faster in downloading and uploading. I can highly recommend this product, I am very happy with it.",5
I use it with my IBM Thinkpad to download pictures from a Nikon Coolpix 5000 with a 512MB CF card. This adapter works great. Plugged it in and WinXP automatically recognized it as E drive. This adapter worked in Win2000 and Win98 as well. Great price and buying it new is actually cheaper than used!,5
"This is a fabulous device for transferring large volume of data from my handheld (Jornada 548) to my laptop, and vice-versa.",5
This is a very high quality leather case with good hardware.  My laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything.  The almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords.  There isn't a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge.  The velcro flap fastners are noisey and overdone.  A few snaps would have been much better.  Other than that the quality is first rate.,4
"I bought this Targus CLN5 15.4 Traditional Leather Case through Amazon with Data Vision as the seller. Why did I mention that? Because this case has recently undergone a ""refresh"" as they put it, which means they re-designed it. The newer version, which is what I received from Data Vision, has way more pockets and space than the much older original version. I contacted another large supplier and they in fact had the older version, and were charging more money. You will notice that it is selling for much more from all of the other suppliers. The new one is great.This model, unlike some of the competition is all leather on the outside. Lesser models have leather faces on them, but then they have plastic sides. There is plenty of room for everything in here. I have a 15.4 inch laptop, and I can store the large section of the A/C adapter in the same section. They even have an adjustable dividing flap in that section so it does not touch your laptop. The remaining detachable plug in cord of the adapter goes in the compartmentalized section of the case with all of the other items, like wireless mouse, cable connector for myVantec LapCool 4 LPC-420 Foldable Notebook Cooler with 4-Port Hub (Black)which sits neatly under the laptop since folded up for transport it only takes up .9 inches of space. (9/10ths of one inch) So this case has ample room for my HP 50G-133US laptop as well as the .9 inch cooler sitting underneath. With the velcro secured tie down strap, nothing moves.There are more compartments on the other side as well. The pictures illustrating this case are a mish mosh of both series. The one I received from Data Vision, the newer ""refresh"" version as they call it, is the one you see in photo number 1, the featured photo. If you notice the second picture and other pictures are a different case, the older version. You can easily see the difference because the older one has a long pad on the strap, and the new one has an oval, adjustable one. By visiting Targus's website you can see photos of the new one in its completeness. I would upload those photos, but I think it is smart to leave the mix, since that is what some of the suppliers are selling.This case has a definite luxury about it. They have their top cases going for 4 times as much, but this one really fills the bill nicely; it's executive material without going over the top. Hey for 10 or 15 dollars less than the Data Vision price you can buy an all plastic one.Overall this case is well designed, and comfortable. Highly recommended.",5
Product shipped fast and looks exactly as it did in the photo. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.,5
"I bought this bag for a 15.4'' laptop mbp, an extra battery, a spare HD, and some papers. Not very much stuff. So I was extremely disappointed that a $ 90 leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag, where the strap was stitched in the side.This bag was used for 7 months before the strap ripped under normal, daily usage. There was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this one.",2
"There are better cases on the market, but I couldn't find one close to the price of this one.  Holds the PC snuggly, and there is lots of gadget space.  Great deal.",5
Looks nice. Only complaint is if moderately packed it is hard to close. Good for the light traveler.,3
"There's no way I cannot not like this bag - its leathery, its tough, it looks good and has a LOT of space for a laptop and paperwork. And I never paid a dime for the 10 that I had.I get these for free back when I worked for IBM. We were moving out of a client site and moving our assets out of that client company. I have a stack of these things and was told to throw them away. I decided to keep them as they were near brand new, some still had the product inspector's card in it. I cleaned up the leather and conditioned them.I still have 1 left. I gave the rest away...wish I had known how much these sold for~!",4
"I got one of these before and they are really good.  I was going to get one at Staples but it was $32.  I paid $10 less for the same product, that is a good deal to me.",4
When will Amazon wise up and allow NO stars for a rating?This is so cheaply made it is worthless.  The battery compartment is &#34;held in place&#34; by a tiny plastic bar.  Broke almost immediately on my unit making the thing totally useless; with out the battery compartment locked in place it simply doesn't work.  They might as well have made the cable out of a piece of string!Don't waste your money,1
"Like many other people here, my lock jammed. Luckily, I didn't pay for it, my company did. Worked for about 6 months and then just stopped working. I don't think it ""magically"" reset its own combination. Mechanical locks don't do that. More likely the rotating mechanism that allows the lock to unlock got jammed. My IT guy had to saw it off. Did some damage to the cosmetics of my company laptop.Simply put: Don't use this product.Great while it worked. Imagine getting it jammed at a coffee house rather then your office or home. Yikes.",1
"I travel with my notebook in my backpack. I have had three of these things. You have to read the instructions to set the combination correctly!They all have worked well and they NEVER have changed the combination on me spontaneously!The newer model has the same features but uses AAA bats and not a 9V which the old one used.  It is thiner than the old model also.  I like the blinking red light when ever I arm it.  I run the cable through my zipper on my backpack and leave in strapped to the desk or chair in my hotel room.  It  creates a shrill LOUD alarm (if you set it for this feature) when the unit is moved.  There are two sensitivities.  You can set it to only alarm if the cable is cut.  Yes you can cut the cable with a good set of wire cutters...so it would not stop anyone determined to take your notebook from you and had strong intentions to do so.  It will stop someone from just grabbing it and trying to run.I also really like the little gadget in the photo...(lower right hand corner of photo) it fits into the security hole of my notebook very snugly.  The cable of the Defcon can go through the hole of this gadget and you can just lay it next to your notebook and it will start to ""scream"" as soon as the notebook is moved (it does give you a ~15 second warning before ""screaming"" with a loud CHIRP sound, so you can disarm it.  Go to Targus website and check it out.  I don't work for them.  I do believe they sell a quality little alarm.  It is not Fort Knox,  it is a lot better than nothing.  Blinking light and siren deters the common dumb criminal (not on drugs or really crazy)from taking your computer.  It's should be just one of a series of methods you have to secure your notebook, not the only one.It's nice for travel.  You can even hang the thing on a door knob and know if someone opens the door.  It's a motion alarm with a blinking red light.  The number of blinks tells you how it is armed. I recommend it.",5
"This is not a review of the product but I thought this information may be good to know before you order. Could save someone money and frustration.I ordered this Defcon 1 unit (~$34) in April 2013, and received a Devcon CL (combination lock and cable ~$21) that was improperly labled with an Amazon SKU label listed improperly as a Defcon 1 unit. It arrived in a clear plastic pack so I could see it was the wrong item. If I did not have Prime it would likely have cost me shipping. Prime enabled me to return it and get a full refund, so I was OK with this. Just FYI, if you are ordering this and paying for shipping.It looked like a good device and was recommended to lock down a ~$300 RV voltage protector that can be stolen easily while camping. But, rather than risk another mislabeled device from the same Amazon seller, I opted to use something else.  Amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens, but you would probably lose it if you requested a refund.Be aware this is the FIRST time an Amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over 15 years of business with Amazon (I am very happy with Amazon and appreciate their costomer service), so I just wanted to help if you pay for shipping. Sorry this is not a review but I HOPE this helps someone.",1
Great lock for the price.  If you need a low cost lock to defend against amateur thieves than this is the lock for you.,5
"I bought a Defcon 1 PA 400U in 1998. It works perfectly x 13 years. It has no key, but works w a combination.I have just bought another for another computer.",5
I needed three of these for field employees.Easy to set-up a memorable code and attach to the laptop.I would recommend!,5
"Wow. I am enraged right now at this godforsaken POS laptop ""lock"". Let me set the scene:I go into the library for a nice, long afternoon of studying. I don't feel comfortable leaving my laptop on the table whenever I go to the bathroom, so I bring this Targus Defcon CL along to secure my computer for whenever I'm not at the table. I connect it and get on with my studying. Come dinnertime, I feel it's time to go, so I put the combo in the lock and IT WON'T UNLOCK. WTF.I am getting frantic, thinking maybe I've gone insane and forgot the combo (which would be impossible since it's the digits of my freaking date of birth). Desperate, I Google ""Targus Defcon CL won't open"". Lo and behold, this exact same thing has happened to hundreds of other people!! The Amazon reviews alone are almost all about how the combo will randomly change on you! Now I'm trippin out, so I start Googling a way to open the piece of crap up without the combo. Luckily, engagdet.com did an article a few years ago about how easy it is to cut the cable or to decipher the combination of these things.I drive home to grab a strong set of wire cutters, and come back to cut the cable. Takes me about 10 minutes to cut through, with a 7"" wire cutter (something a person can have in their pocket while you're away from your comp, spend 10 min, and be off with your laptop in their hands). Unfortunately, during that 10 min duration, someone reports me to the librarian because they think I'm trying to steal a laptop. I have to log in to the computer to prove that it's mine. Slightly embarrassing, but even he thought it was hilarious that the lock not only messed up my combo, but was pretty easy to cut through.SO, to recap, the reasons this is the WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED:1) IT WILL RANDOMLY CHANGE THE COMBO. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN MORE CASES THAN NOT (Google it).2) The cable literally takes 5-10 minutes with a mediocre set of cutters to get through. Anyone can take your laptop if you are off in the bathroom or something for a bit.",1
"I bought 25 of these for my work so we can lock down our laptops while at the client site.  The product is good, minus the fact you can only set the lock code once.  I already had a coworker forget his code after 1 day, so we had to scrap that lock.",4
"Compares favorably with much more expensive cables. I actually don't use it for anti-theft, but as a safety wire to secure a ceiling mounted video projector, but I'm sure it works as a theft prevention devise as well. Fit the DEFCON connector and the price was right.",4
For users that travels a lot 100% recomended most cases when you need leave your notebook in some conference room or room hotel.,3
"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, I bought the combo lock and the key lock and they both work great for me.  I take them to starbucks all the time and no one touches my laptop.  This is a great BUY, WORTH YOUR MONEY",5
"Like this key lock, as I always had problems with the combination locks. The length of this is not too long, and I did not have problems with chemical smells that some people have mentioned. I noticed that the review section for this product had people reviewing the combination lock. I had the combination version the combination changed and I had to pry it off my computer.",5
"If you follow the instructions (that is why they are there) this lock will work just fine, I have never had it ""mysteriously"" change combination on me.  There are only two problems with this little lock, the first is, it tends to seize up on occasion, but it comes out after a few seconds (not 5 minutes as mentioned by another reviewer).  Also, this lock is fairly easy to change the combo, so if you have a roommate that hates you, or criminals that carry around screwdrivers, you may be in a bit of trouble.This is a MECHANICAL lock, it does not have a ""mind o it's own.""",4
"This device has a major design flaw and does not prevent thieves from cutting it up.  I used this poorly designed lock on my macbook pro and the thief was still able to destroy the lock with a cutter.  Mind you, the lock portion was destroyed, not the cable.  The thief was able to yank out enough of a crease located between my laptop hole and the combo lock itself for his metal cutter to easily break its clippers.  Basically this device provides a false sense of security when contends to a thief with formidably-equipped metal cutter.",1
I now have three of these and have to HIGHLY recommend this item.  I use it for my computer as well as for my tv center.,5
"I bought this product veeeery long time ago and never used till 4 moths ago. I bought in 2009 and I used on september 2012. for first time because I needed. I had a very % dollars cheap ruler extension same like this but cheap. I needed this for split the power overloading on my other extension, because the other one when overloaded pops up the switch and turns off, so i split the power and it was everything ok, and then this surge arrest protector starts burning inside and smelling to burnt plastic. Me and my roomate saw it and yes, the power cable was hot as hell as it might be on for hours at full capacity and then the inside of the surge arrest start somking so we unpluged, and if it wasnt because of the fact we were there and realized this happen, what if we just leave and leave this protector running, I am sure we might found a big fire when we might come back. In other words I had to put this in trash because it has no such a protection, my 5 dollar protector ""extension"" workd better than this pice of s*** because that one when it is over loaded automatically pops up the power button and turns off but dont got burnt. BE CAREFULL PELASE AND SAVE MONEY. Just keep an eye  on this, if you use normally might work fine but if you kind of overload with too much electric devices all of them runing this will NOT PROTECT INSTEAD THIS WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE Try by yourself if not beleive it. if this might be a trully protector might turn it off automatically when overload but this keeps running till gots on fire.",1
"I used my 8-outlet SurgeArrest protector to protect my home office equipment. One day, ""POOF"" went my computer during a quick power outage. The incoming power surge when the power came back on was too much for APC to handle.Sent my unit in for eval, as they request. They said that since there was no evidence of a failure of their product, they would NOT compensate me for my power supply and motherboard being fried.Are they too dense to understand that if their product fails to stop a surge, it may be a case of the MOVs NOT blowing? MOVs are designed to take the hit and suffer the damage, protecting your electronics from the surge. Their device failed to stop a surge, failing to protect my equipment!My advice - if your equipment and data are valuable to you, then purchase one of the ""series-based"" surge protectors (APC does not make these). As they say, you get what you pay for. Except with APC, who fail to honor their warranties.For those who insist on using cheap surge protectors, I hope you protect your vehicles with a good set of Deer Whistles. Same sales principle - make them cheap enough for everyone, spin a marketing campaign stating they do the job, then rake in the profits while benefiting from consumers who will either not report a failure, or who will whimper quietly off into the sunset without complaining or sharing their experiences with the worthless product. If APC sold Deer whistles, and a deer hits your car, they would avoid fulfilling their warranty because the whistles are not defective.The product may not have failed mechanically or electronically, but it certainly FAILED to provide protection. Pay up, APC!",1
"I purchase this item in Amazon. Which I purchase a lot of things in Amazon. This item arrive on time, it is so nice and convenient to have at home or if you are travelling to take it with you in order to charge all the things that we have now days that have to be charge.It is just like the description say. Easy to set up you can put on the wall if you like? Or on the floor. I am living for overseas and it is going to be very convenient item to have.Luz M Brown",5
"The point of purchasing the APC surge protector was to increase the safety for my equipment and home.Now the company has recalled their ""older"" products (Ours was purchased in March 2010)due to potential fires during very unusual conditions.  Instead of more safety, we had less.This is unacceptable for this type of product and causes concern about my other APC surge protector that I purchased later but was not in the recall.  Does the later product not have the same problem or has it not been out long enough for customers to report problems?  I chose to avoid the possible risk and to replace it with a different brand.Also unacceptable is the only recourse for the consumer is to apply for a newer model.  A better company would have offered a full refund option.Needless to say, I will not be purchasing any more APC products.",1
"This surge protector works well and provides lots of outlets, more than I actually need for my equipment.  It does the job.",4
"APC (which by the way is American Power Conversion, not ""American Power Conservation"" as amazon.com currently shows it) has always been serious about clean power. This is no ordinary surge protector. It has more  heavy-duty protection features and absorbs more joules of surge energy than  you're ever likely to see. But what I like is the intelligent layout of the  outlets ... with my ADSL modem, I now have three huge ""wall warts"" to deal  with. The PRO8T2 handles them well, and manages another smaller one in the  top tier of outlets. A large green light lets me know it's working. And the  switch guard is removable -- if you WANT to be able to turn this unit on  and off with your toe, APC made that possible, and they call out the  feature in the instructions. You can spend $20 for a much less capable  power station, or a few bucks more for one that will take care of your  stuff. APC delivers the latter with this unit.",5
"There are other power surge protectors cheaper and smaller. After my Belkin protector broke after a direct lightning hit on my house, I purchased this item. The equipment I had plugged into the Belkin model did not survive the direct hit. The other model of APC I had did protect my iMac. I will never pruchase another Belkin again. Belkin is cheaper, but you get what you pay for. APC are built better, feel more solid, then the cheap plastic Belkin protectors are.",5
Fits great under a small desk and plug is flat against the outlet saving more room. On Off switch in front also easily accessable. Fills need for smaller footprint surge arrest.,5
"I've had my SPIII for about two years now, during which the pricing has come down some and the package offerings have increased, so this review may not match the exact contents Amazon offers here. My unit came with a 32MB memory cartidge, the serial port connection cord, the USB programmer cord, the 12V power cord for the cigarette lighter, the &quot;sticky&quot; dash mount, and a MapSource CD with codes to unlock one region (the US and Canada consisted of 5-6 regions, IIRC). I have since bought the beanbag dash mount and a 128MB card and purchased the &quot;unlock all regions&quot; option for City Navigator--probably already included items for a new purchase in today's package. Additionally, I downloaded the &quot;British&quot; voice package from Garmin's website to replace the default &quot;American&quot; voice--the British lady's voice seems less harsh and less like a drill sergeant when giving directions!I love this unit because it makes navigation so easy--isn't that the idea behind a GPSR? With the CityNav map information loaded into the memory card (and with 128MB it fits all of PA, DE, MD, and D.C. and good chunks of WV, OH, NY, and NJ) I am able to get turn-by-turn directions to nearly any street address. If you ask it to route you to a given destination, the unit actually tells you when a turn is coming up, e.g. &quot;In point two miles exit right,&quot; or &quot;In 500 feet turn left.&quot; If you are driving without a destination selected, the unit will display the cross streets by name as you approach. You can zoom the map in for street detail or zoom out to see more of the countryside. If you have a destination selected, the unit will zoom in automatically as you approach and zoom in even more for a detailed overview of approaching intersections as you near a turn.If you are in an area for which you do not have the MapSource detail loaded, the unit still has an internal base map that contains cities, highways, interstates, and major bodies of water, so it can still route you from city to city using the major roads. This makes driving long distances cross-country feasible and you can load up the memory card with the areas you expect to spend most of your time in if you don't have enough memory for the entire route.However, in those areas for which you do have the map detail loaded you can get turn-by-turn directions to an address or even select various destinations (restaurants, attractions, banks, shopping centers, etc.) listed by name and/or distance. The unit also displays address and phone information for those destinations, which is useful to call ahead and make reservations or check for vacancy if you're the spontaneous weekend tourist like I am.The 16-color display is beautiful--major routes are in red, arterials in thick black, minor streets in thin black, rivers and lakes in blue, parks and golf courses in green, and the background will change at sunset or sunrise to yellow (daylight) or black (night) as appropriate (the black streets will also switch to white at night).Please note that the map detail, which includes streets and popular destinations, is a feature of the map software, not the unit itself. Garmin seems to issue updated map software on an annual basis, but you must pay for those updates. I'm still using CityNav 4.1, although Garmin's website states that 6.0 is coming out this summer. The new 6.0 software will probably contain more business listings and reflect more recent road construction, but I'm doing fine with 4.1 and don't see a need yet to pay for the upgrade. One reviewer complained about the lack of Starbucks locations with his map, and I expect Garmin will be adding more and more types of businesses like that as time goes by.Enough babbling--in summary, here are some pros of this unit:o Cheaper than most in-dash GPS systemso Portable, so you can share the unit with your &quot;fleet&quot; or take it along in a rental car (and you'd best hide it or take it with you when parking so it doesn't get stolen)o Voice navigation, so you can anticipate an upcoming turn without having to take your eyes off the roado Color display--so much better than a gray scale map!o Accurate and helpful when driving somewhere unfamiliaro Automatic route recalculation if you miss a turn or have to detouro Address and phone info for listed businesses/sites so you can call aheadAnd the cons I've experienced:o Voice navigation could be somewhat improved for confusing intersections--do I take a right or sharp right at this five-way?o Eats batteries--but this unit is too bulky to walk around with, so there is no reason it should ever be used without being plugged into your cigarette lighter.o Awkward interface--entering street names or address numbers is awkward with the rocker buttono Loses signal in built-up areas with tall buildings--usually when you are downtown and *really* need directions the most, unfortunately! However, this is a problem with all GPS receivers and due more to the nature of the GPS system than the unit itself.All in all, I love my SPIII. It has all the features I really need. There are units out there that are newer, have more features, and may be easier to use, but they're also more expensive. As long as Garmin keeps releasing updated map software compatible with the SPIII, this unit should serve my needs for many more years.",4
"I just replaced the Garmin GPS III+, which I had in my truck, with the  ColorMap. The screen is much easier to see in a variety of lighting  conditions. The ColorMap also changes some of the field colors, depending  on the time of day, to provide ever greater visibility. This unit is really  designed to be used in a vehicle and provides features to that effect such  as a readout stating which road your currently on. This is much easier than  trying to find the road label while you're driving along.The ROM maps  cover most major areas of the US, but for true coolness you need a memory  cartridge and a copy of the MetroGuide CD ROM. The areas in this software  are HUGE so I suggest going with the 16 Meg cart and skipping the 8 meg  one. For example, Northern Virginia takes about 7 Meg and the DC metro area  is another 7 Meg. Anyone living in either area probably wants both regions  available so you can see that the 16 Meg cartridge is key. All in all, a  very cool toy.",5
"I bought my SP3 when I moved to the Washington DC area, and have to say it works great.  I am never lost and it can find nearly everything.  There are a few streets that have no numbers in Arlington, but otherwise it is pretty good.I have also used the SP when traveling to other areas.  The one issue that I have is that it has a hard time keeping a good signal in the city because of all the buildings.  DC is not too bad, but I have had bigger problems in places like NYC and Toronto with the tall skyscrapers.  If it is plotting a course for you, you might miss a turn because it loses the signal for a few seconds.  To make things worse, since there is such a grid in the cities, it often takes a while to recalculate the course, by which point you might be lost again.  I find times when I need to pull off and wait for the GPS to catch up.I would highly recommend it if you travel a lot, or are unfamiliar with an area, just be careful if you are using it for large cities.",4
"First I want to say I am very happy with the talking SPIII.  It is does a pretty good job routing and if you drive off the route it will autorecalc a new route for you. I have used numerous GPS's in the past and this does a great job for driving (for biking or hiking I HIGHLY recommend the Garmin 12 Map, my favorite GPS).Now there are some things to know about this product however.  First you get a CD that allows you to download maps from your PC to your Steetpilot.  It works over either serial or USB (USB goes to a 32MB memory card that you can plug in).  The CD contains maps of the US BUT... you only get to select one region of the US for free.  The rest of them you must pay for from Garmin for approx $116 a shot ($291 total for the total US).  You can purchase this online at Garmin's web site and they will give you a key to open up the different regions. The base map. the one built into the Garmin, on the GPS is still &quot;good&quot; for the whole US but the CD give MUCH better detail.  I am not complaining about this since the maps seem pretty up to date.  The road I live on is 2 years old and no other mapping software to my knowledge has it as part of their data but the Garmin software did.Another thing to note is the form factor for the StreetPilot III and the older street pilots are different.  this can be important if you order from Garmin direct accessories like the bean bag mount (as I found out).",5
"Please allow me to preface this review with the fact that I have absolutely no sense of direction.  For those with excellent sense of direction, this may seem like an extravagant purchase until they come down in cost.I had to travel to California recently (I only lived there my whole life before 1999), but since I had never driven in California before, I was quite nervous about doing so.  The rental car had a GPS very similar to the Street Pilot, and using that gave me a great sense of confidence in driving around.Shortly after my return I realized how badly we needed a GPS in our car.  The Street Pilot was the best option for us because it has all the features of a factory-installed auto GPS, but the added convenience of being portable- now when I head out of town I can take the Street Pilot rather than having to rent a car with a GPS.  Not to mention the Street Pilot is about 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost of a factory-installed system.Some of the other reviewers have complained about how long it takes the Street Pilot to recalculate a route once the vehicle has gone off-route.  I have intentionally gone off-route several times just to see how it performs, and I have been very pleased.  It does take a few seconds, but from my experience it did not take so long that I got any further off-course than I already was.A feature that I found to be very helpful in the Street Pilot which was not in the rental car's GPS is a search by company name.  If you're looking for a department store, but you can't remember its address, just search by the name, and the Street Pilot will navigate you to the closest one. If you're looking for that great Chinese restaurant a couple of miles away, but you can't remember the name, you can search for Chinese restaurants in your area and find the correct one based on its address.  Want to order ahead, or put your name on the seating list?  Once the Street Pilot finds the restaurant you're looking for, it displays their phone number on the monitor as well.About the only two complaints I have about the Street Pilot are very trivial.  On the rental car I used, the GPS would automatically lower the volume on the stereo when the GPS needed to announce an instruction.  Being an external unit, the Street Pilot does not have this luxury.  Since I tend to listen to music, well, at ear-splitting volume while driving, it does take a little getting used to lowering the volume when using the Street Pilot around town, but again, this is a very minor complaint given all of the positive features the Street Pilot has.My other complaint is that occasionally it does give directions which are not the most direct route.  I used this on a trial basis in areas I was familiar with just to see how it performs, and I did find myself thinking on occasion ""why is it telling me to go this way, when that way is much more direct?""  Especially since I live within a half an hour of Garmin's world headquarters, it would seem to me that they would at least know the most direct routes around here!  But even at this, the Street Pilot DOES get you to the correct destination every time, even if it sometimes takes an indirect route.I noticed that the package includes both a beanbag mount and a permanent dashboard mount for the Street Pilot.  Since Street Pilots have a way of being swiped, my suggestion would be to always use the beanbag mount, since a permanent mount could cause thieves to break into the car to find the GPS that is no longer in the car.  I drive a new Jetta, and I did not want to get sticky stuff all over my dashboard, so I chose to try out the beanbag.  It does not slip, even when making sharp turns.  I suppose if I were in a collision this would not be the case, but in normal driving, the beanbag is great.Of course, as others have advised, do not leave your Street Pilot in the car unattended for any reason.  But given the fact that you're going to be spending around $1G for this puppy you probably already knew that.And one other safety feature that I think is great, but others might be annoyed by it: once you are driving, you cannot change the destination; it goes into a secure mode.  To change the address, you need to stop the car.  This may be a nuisance to some, but given how badly people drive while talking on cell phones, it's probably best that Garmin tries to curb people from pressing all sorts of buttons on their GPS while zipping down the road at 75 MPH.",5
"How much would you spend to protect your $... palm?  this case looks real good, and it fits your palm like a glove, adds very little additional weight and gives you the mental peace that your palm will be protected from about everything it could happen to it.  Leather may look more stylish, but they are also bulky. A great buy.",5
"I too thought this case was a bit on the flimsy side, given its plastic + metal covering construction.  However, my Palm Vx has survived more than its share of bumps and drops with aplomb, and it's because of this case.  It opens easily, closes easily, and still fits in my pocket comfortably.  I'm confident the Palm's screen is protected with this case.  It's given great service for over a year now.",5
"The hard case is stylish, compact, and a good protector of my investment. One reviewer wrote that it is difficult to charge the Palm with the case on. It really isn't a problem at all if you place the charger on the edge  of your desk so that hard case can extend off. I don't worry about it  falling over since the charge is so sturdy. I love the case because it  provides such great protection in a stylish manner. enjoy!",5
Very nice. My Palm Vx fits in it & is Protected. It is also shiny,5
"This case has worked great for me! It protects your Palm V from falls, spills, and related &quot;accidents&quot; I also like the look of the case a lot. It blends well with the design of the Palm V. The only  &quot;cons&quot; I could find to this case is that It will add weight and  size to your palm. Nonetheless, it is well worth the protection you get  (Plus, this will fix the problem the Palm V has with its regular cover of  turning itself on).  Sure, you'll have to pull the Palm V out of the case  to HotSync, but that will only take 2 secs. I love my hard case, and it has  certainly lived up to its job of protecting my Palm.",5
"This is the perfect example of excellent marketing pushing an inferior product to market.  The consumer is fooled into thinking that this &quot;hard case&quot; is actually hard and is actually made of alumunim,  when in fact the case is made of PLASTIC and has two VERY thin strips of  aluminum outside the plastic.  This case could easily crack under little  pressure.  I purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the  plastic composition and flimsiness of the case.  For 40 bucks you think  you'd get something nice and strong, but save your hard-earned money for  some other case.  If you want just something to protect your Palm V in, I'd  strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable  than this plastic case.  Even better, go for the leather case that has a  zipper.  For even more protection, go for the Rhinoskin Palm protectors.  Those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money,  considering the amount of money it costs to replace your Palm if you damage  it.The only reason why you should buy this flimsy, overpriced  &quot;hard case&quot; is if you have a LOT of money to blow, care more  about looks than functionality, and don't care if your Palm actually gets  damaged.  This case will pop open when you don't expect it, and who knows  what will happen to your Palm's panel.",1
"After recently purchasing a new Palm Vx, I thought it would be a good idea to invest in a better form of protection than the included leatherette flap. The Palm V hard case is about the only sleek option that there is at the moment.The case attaches to the Palm V via the left stylus storage area. A stylus shaped piece attaches the Palm to the hinge in the case. The case itself opens like a book and allows the Palm to move much like a page in the book. Located behind the Palm on the inside of the case is an area to store a business card or other small piece of paper. The case comes together nicely and has a cut out for the IR port as well as the right stylus.Pros:1) Protects as advertised. The point of a hard case should be adequate protection first of all, and this case delivers as advertised. The aluminum reinforced plastic shell hugs the Palm V tightly and securely.2) Allows for IR port usage while resting in case.3) Case does not allow for you to accidentally turn the unit on while in your pocketCons:1) Heavy: One of the selling points for the Palm V series is the sleek, lightweight design. While this case may not seem like too much additional weight, the combination of the Palm V in the case is noticeably heavier. In fact my wife's Palm III and my Palm V weigh about the same now.2) Obstructive: hot sync is really only accomplished by taking the unit out of the case due to the girth of the case itself. A friend of mine who has a keyboard tried to rest the unit on the keyboard and found the case too cumbersome for this purpose as well.3) Hand holding the unit is more difficult. With the included leather flap, you are able to fold it behind the unit to easily hold the Palm in one hand. The hard case does not fold back on itself, which means there is a much larger surface area to support while using the Palm. This is especially annoying for me since I use my Palm frequently while standing or walking here and there.4) ...Overall, I think the hard case is best suited for someone who is looking to provide the best protection for his or her Palm in the smallest package. You will have to decide if the increased weight and obtrusiveness of the case is worth the added protection it offers. At this time, I am still using the case, but I anticipate going back to the default leather flap in the future when I grow tired of the Cons listed above.Thanks for your time...",3
"I was skeptical of the palm hardcase at first. Afterall, it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum sheeting on it. I no longer have doubts.I have unintentionally dropped my Palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces (brick, hard wood floor, etc.), and both the case and, more importantly, the Palm itself have come out completely unscathed.So, my advice is, if you are looking for real protection for your investment, just get one of these. There is no need to spend more on a titanium box from rhino skin or any of the others (unless you are planning on using the Palm for mountain climbing or on the shooting range...).Not surprisingly, the engineers over at Palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish, too. You don't feel geeky pulling it out, and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the Palm itself.An excellent product.",5
"I was going to buy one of these cases for my new Palm Vx.  It looked great and I figured if it was made by Palm that it would be a good buy to keep my new toy...I mean tool...safe.  Fortunately, I saw one in a store before I  ordered one.  As some of the other reviews have said, it's made out of  cheap plastic with a thin sheet of metal on the front for decoration.  The  hingers are fragile and the spring-loading is weak.  I don't think it's  worth the cost and I've seen them as low as $25.If you're buying a  hardcase, I'm assuming you want some protection for your Palm.  This won't  give it to you.  If you just want something that looks good to cover-up,  there are lots of nice leather ones out there.As for me, I decided to  spend the extra money on a Rhinoskin molded aluminum case.  I'll let you  know how that goes.  So far, so good...check them out.",1
"This is the best Palm V case going... actually almost the best. Palm just released a metallic blue special edition hard case that I like a little better, but this case is great.While the plastic was a bit of a  turn-off, at least the brushed stainless steel makes the case a bit more  attractive and looks pretty sleek much like the Palm V itself. I imagine  that is part of the reason you bought the V instead of the III or the  VII.The case does not close quite as tight as I would like, but if you  mess with centering the hinge it closes. It provides the best protection of  the cases I have tried and does not make the palm so bulky that you can't  stand to take it everywhere you go.I would recommend this or the new  blue case to anyone who likes the sleek modern look and wants to protect  their investment and their data.",5
This is a great item.  I tried three different 'soft' cases and always had a problem with the Palm coming on and beeping while it was in my pocket.  Give this baby FIVE STARS!The critism is WRONG.  A.  Can't use left  handed?  Sure you can.  Just put it in the left side!B.  Can't synch  while in the case?  You bet you can.  Just tilt the stand to the side.  No  problem.,5
"I initially bought the Special Edition one but since i loved that so much i went out and bought the silver one as well. Now i rotate my cases. The only difference of the silver case and the blue special edition case other than color is the logo in the front. The blue one has the circular palm logo while the silver one has the dotted ""P"" logo of palm, like the one that you see whenever you reset the unit. I first bought the slim leather case for my Vx and after i used it for about 2 months, i became quite dissatified with it. One of the reasons why i was not happy with the slim case was because it made the whole Vx a lot bigger then it really is. Also after a few months the leather case had a few noticable scratches. It also began to warp. I decided to find an alternative. After much thought i decided to get the hard case for the Vx.  At first i was discouraged that i had to remove the case every time i hotsynced. However after heeding the suggestions of many others i found that proping it up on a book or a bunch of cd cases actually works well. I dont think there is any other case that allows you to sync that easy without removing the case. In that aspect i dont think there is a better case. However i discover that you have to insert the unit properly for the case to open and stay closed right. If you dont push the case far enough into the silo it really wont work right. If you insert the unit properly it opens and closes brilliantly.The spring loaded feature of the case is probably its best feature. When opening and closing the case it is very noticable that there is more tension opening the case then there is closing. In that aspect there is really no other case out there at offers that.One thing that i disliked about the slim leather case was that often times the buttons were accidentally pressed. whether it was the application buttons or the power button, it often got pressed even with the leather case firmly closed. That was not the case for the hard case. Although the contrast button was pressed occationally pressed, its extremely rare.Also with the hard case firmly shut, the unit is allowed to move a little, just enough to allow some impact to be absorbed when you accidentally bump or drop it.Finally and more importantly the case is one of very few that actually protects the unit, looks good and maintains the shape and sleekness of the Vx. It adds virtually nothing to the overall size of the Vx. Its BEAUTIFUL...I just hope that it will fit the m505 when i go get that! :-)",5
"I'm a computer consultant, which means I use my PalmPilot all the time.  I had a Palm III, but it died from the abuse of travelling in my back pocket.  I switched to the Palm V series for its solid construction and rechargable battery.  I searched for a case that would protect the device from daily wear and tear and chose the Palm V hard case for this reason.  It protects the screen with its clamshell closure and does not add bulk to the package.  Even with the case, it's still smaller than a Palm III.  You have to keep your cradle near the edge of your desk if you want to HotSync while still inside the case.  I had to add small adhesive pads to protect the metallic finish.  Other than that, it's perfect!  When I beat up the case too much, I'll just buy another one.  My Palm V still looks brand new!",4
"I'll admit it, I bought the case (the metallic blue one too!) just because it was sexy. It does a good job protecting my Palm Vx, but the case doesn't seem sturdy. There also seems to be a problem where the contrast button at the top of the Palm Pilot gets pressed by the case, this can be fixed by sliding the Palm just a hair. Overall, this case rocks, very glad I got it, the metallic blue one is better though, I get many compliments and good looks from it. Buy It!",4
"When I saw pictures of this, I expected this to be a substantial case.  Since it's called a hard case, I expected it, well, to be HARD.  But it's not.  It's plastic with a thin metal cover on the front and back that look more like they are there for fashion than funciton.  The metal sides will give if you try to bend it.  Also, I think the closing mechanism is terrible.  You have to get the Palm in there just right for it to close completely and even then, it's not a tight seal.  And usually when it's put in this way, the top of the case will hit the contrast button and you'll have to keep fixing it so you can view the screen. It does not snap together, which annoys me.  While the case itself may not stay shut, the Palm *is* securely held in the case, which is one good thing about this case. It has a holder similair to the stylus, so you just slide it in one of your stylus slots.  I prefer this way of attaching the Palm, rather than some other cases which use Velcro.  I'm not going to trust velcro with something that is as expensive as a palm.I totally don't think it's worth the money, but at the same time, having good protection for your Palm is an absolute necessity, so I actually DO recommend that you get this product.  My Palm has taken several tumbles and it's no worse for the wear.  I've had my Palm and case for about two weeks now, and there's already quite a few scratches on the metal casing.  So it does protect it.  But if you are expecting this case to be really nicely made and substantial, guess again.  It will however offer some protection to your PDA.I think Palm could and should be making a better product.  Our Palms cost us a bundle and we want to protect them.  It's almost like the people at Palm want our PDA's to break so they can sell us more.  I don't see why there's so much emphasis on making the cases as small as possible.  I'd rather see a slightly bulkier, yet streamlined case that not only securely held the Palm, but had about a quarter inch of foam padding on the inside to protect the unit from damage, and then a true metal casing on the outside.  Even with some extra padding and bulk, the case would still be tiny.",3
"I did a previous review on this case, which I liked, and just wanted to clear up a misconception I read by another reviewer.He said the case doesn't offer that much protection because it's just plastic with an aluminum finish. No. The case has real aluminum bonded to plastic, because one of the occasional problems I've heard about with this case is that the aluminum will sometimes delaminate and separate from the plastic.Aside from the occasional problem like that, I found this to be quality case. Although it seems little pricey when you first purchase it, it's worth it as it costs $100 to get the glass screen replaced by Palm if it breaks.",4
"I tried the chintzy cover that came with the Palm V, but it does not offer enough protection.  Then I tried the &quot;slim&quot; leather case from 3Com, and it's OK, but bulky, and the strap that closes it is inconvenient.  Finally managed to find the hard case at CompUSA, and like it the best.  OK, it's not perfect.... you do have to remove the V or put it on a book in  order to HotSync, but so what?  For my money, the hard case is the way to  go.",5
"The Palm Hard Case will keep your Palm V protected, without adding much to it's size or weight.  Since I have the Slim Leather Case, and tried the RhinoSkin case, I'll try to address some of the complaints others have  posted.It's only plastic -- True, but the outer metal shield adds quite  a bit of protection.The spring is weak -- Part of the problem with using  the Palm V hard case is installing your Palm.  If the rail is not centered  in the stylus holder, either the front or the back of the case will not  close properly, giving the impression that the springs are weak.  True,  they could be stronger, but if you use your Palm a lot you want it to open  easily.  There is a line and a flat side on the rail to help you center it.  It may take a few tries, but keep at it.You have to remove your Palm to  use the HotSync cradle -- Not true.  Just move the cradle to the edge of  the table or desk and let the case hang over the edge.  Just be careful you  don't knock it off the desk accidently.  Others have suggested placing a  book under the cradle.  Either works fine.Let's face it.  You bought  your Palm V because of it's size, and you probably use it a lot.  If so,  this is your best option when it comes to cases.  Pretty good protection,  easy to carry (very slim and trim), and easy to open and close.  This case  also solves the problem of your Palm turning itself on accidently, a  problem with the leather cases and covers, although the leather cases are  far more elegant and sumptuous.  Also, because this case does not press on  the scroll button, if you forget to turn off your Palm, and close the case,  your Palm will will turn itself off and not run down the battery.The  RhinoSkin case does offer better protection, however I did not feel it was  worth the money (See my review).",4
"Why spend an extra hundred dollars to get the palm Vx, which is half the size of palm III, and then add a case which makes it about the same size as the palm III again.This unit looks very protective because of the aluminum finish.  However, it is only hardened plastic ... not a great shock protector.  In addition, I had trouble getting the catch to stay closed.I got this as a gift, tried it and do not use it because it adds too much additional bulk.",2
"This one is a good extra investment if you're buying a Palm V.  The little leather flap that comes with the Palm is really not adequate to protect your machine.  This hard case is tough enough to withstand serious blows.  It looks elegant and it's not too big - the Palm will still fit in your  shirt pocket when in the case. I recommend getting this one - you need to  get something to protect from scratching anyway, and this case protects  from much much more.",5
"I  purchased these rechargeable batteries for my daughter and myself. In the description it said twin pack AA batteries. So I ordered 2 packs and was billed for 2 pack shipping. But when I received the batteries, it was a for pack. So if I only received 1 pack of 4 batteries instead of a 2 twin pack of batteries. Why was I billed for 2 twin packs instead of just paying for 1 4 pack. Very confusing.",4
these batteries are exactly what i expected (@1.3 Volts) and work well for any electronic device i put these in i plan on buying even more in the future this is a Great buy,5
"I fully charged them, put them in my digital camera, and immediately got the &#34;low battery&#34; signal. Not made is US. I do not recommend them.",2
"Bought these batteries to use with the Kodak battery charger (which ships with 4 AA batteries.)  Plan was to use them for my digital camera.They work, but unlike the batteries that ship with the Kodak (which are 1600  mAH-rated), these batteries are rated at only 1200 mAH.  mAH means  milli-amp hours and is a measure of the amount of power the battery can  store and deliver before needing to be recharged.So, they deliver only  75% of the life of the higher-rated batteries.  My digital cam responds to  this with a half-battery indicator, even when all 4 batteries are at full  charge.",3
really good deal for only 7 dollars. they came very quick and work like there supposed to. i got what i pad for and have no regrets.,5
Why Case Logic discontinued these I'll never know.  Back in my DVD collecting days there were my chosen medium of storage and protection.,5
"I love these cases, and have a few of them, and will get more.  No real complaints with them - sure reduced the amount of shelf space my DVDs required, and allows me to organize by genre.  The sleeves are held in a 3-ring binder, so they can be pulled out and re-arranged, too, so if you like to keep your DVDs alphabetically, you can pop a new CD into the stream without having to move every DVD like one would have to with the stupid other caselogic cases that don't have removable pages.  The material is strong adn well made.  I very much like the leather look and feel of the case, and they look sharp on the shelf.  The zippers are strong and well formed, the rivets are good, the binder material is sturdy. These babies will last for a good long time.My only complaint with this case - and also the 10 DVD holder from caselogic - is that they really don't hold that many without bulging or overpacking. I figure the 20 DVD holder averages about 18 discs, and the 10 holder gets 8 or 9.  Figure it this way - I have 8 of these holders. One holder when I bought it was missing 5 sleeves.  But even though I started 5 sleeves less I should have, it doesn't matter, becuase after filling all the holders to their capacity, I have about 20 sleeves left over that I can't use, becuase the case holders aren't big enough to hold as many DVDs as they say.The other caveat is that they have no place in which to put a label to let you know what's inside them.  I thought of putting stickers onthem, but realized that open and closing them would eventually force the stickers to come undone, and look ugly. So what I did, and I recommend this to you, is to make small cardstock labels with the contents of the case (I sort mine by genre, so mine say ""Action"" or ""Science fiction"", and each genre has it's own color scheme, etc. I did not put the movie names on the labels, cuz one never knows when one will need to move a movie to another case to make room for another, eh?), and then tied some string to them and put the string through the hole in the zipper handle. This system works wonderfully, and if you make really nice cards for them, they look good, too.For those two reasons, I only give these 4 stars.Those caveats aside, these are wonderful - the sleeves have room to put the front page or other amterials from the DVD, space for the disc itself (they can even fit 2 DVDs in them, for those double DVD sets like Star Wars).  They reduced my shelving needs by about 80%, and for that, it's worth the cost,... And it's way easier to carry 20 DVDs in one package, then 20 plastic DVD containers.Buy these, get your life in order, and open some space in your house.",4
"...I'm so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases. They were great, a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside (that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center). Somebody could have sat on it and it would've been fine...",1
"If you have a lot of DVDs or CDs these wallets are the way to go. I have over 800 CDs and they were eating up my space. After getting rid of all the jewel cases I can store all of my CDs and DVDs on one book shelf. And since I organized them by theme, it is easy to find what I am looking for. By the way: you can mark the outside of the wallets with a  white-out pen. It makes it easy to know what's inside each wallet.  For the DVD wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the Liner notes. But it is easy to do. Trust me... once you start using these wallets, you'll love 'em. For what you get with these wallets I find the price fair. Even better here on Amazon.com Enjoy",5
"CaseLogic has set the standard for media storage, and this continues the tradition. A few tweaks are needed, however. I am certain that I will soon fill the 20 slots. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk. The graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed. Actually, I would prefer that the DVD companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around.",5
It's not foolproof but makes a good inexpensive deterrent. It makes it harder for anyone to just grab and go. I hooked this up to a Mac Mini and a monitor.,4
"Definitely worthwhile for equipment one wants to keep. I teach at an urban high school. It is amazing what some students will take. Ever since a student took my projector when I had a sub so I could attend a meeting, I lock as much down as possible. Interesting that the school district does not bother with locks.",5
"I chose this because I had a monitor without a lock slot. It was almost impossible to find a lock with its own plates! This comes with 3 plastic discs and a tube of superglue.Good points: thick cable, discs stick well.Bad points: cable only works with discs (not lock slots) or holes it can pass through. I don't want to stick a disc to my computer, so I'm using my old lock for it.",5
"I have been using this for a while to secure a monitor and two external hard drives. One of the hard drives died and I wanted to secure its replacement, so ordered another set. While waiting I wondered if I could get the plastic anchor off and re-use it. I set it on a table, placed a putty knife at the joint, and with one feeble blow popped it off. Now I don't feel as secure. The epoxy that came with the set worked fine, but didn't bond to the hard drive's plastic case as strongly as I would have expected.",3
"Hopefully, I never have to find out whether these are affective or not, so I can only comment on the concept.  You can either tie two things to a stable, heavy object such as a big desk, or you can tie three pieces of hardware together (such as in the picture) and make it a pain in the behind for someone to take all three at once and walk out your door. Of course, none of that matters if the person knows you have the cable and brings a snazzy pair of bolt cutters.  I haven't seen a product like this before, so I was thrilled to install it (it took 5 minutes); it's a better deterrent than the more popular kensington slot locks but will leave a gray lock on whatever you put it on, so choose wisely.  In the end, as with most inexpensive security devices, it's really about the piece of mind, rather than the effectiveness of the product.  If you want more, you can dish out some extra green and get you one of them ""MI2"" laser systems.  Cool.",5
"Excellent lock! Kensington builds good stuff.Kensington Desktop Microsaver Universal Computer Key Lock and Cable Security System (64162)I ordered thru ANTOnline though, and I was delivered an ""open box"" which was missng some parts. I ended up going thru the complete dispute procedure to resolve the issue. ANTOnline did not respond. Amazon refunded my money - Nice job!",5
"This will help give you a sense of security. I know from personal experience that you will have to take a hammer and chisel to these discs if you want them off. Wrap them around the desk and you are good. Easy and quick to install, smart design of the discs and the wire, just don't lose the key :)",5
"Excellent! Just what I needed to secure a 32inch flatscreen TV. Of course it hasn't been put to the acid test yet, but install was easy enough and it seems solid enough.",5
The parts that glue to the hardware are quite small compared to other brands. It really just takes a few minutes to install and then your hardware is secure from the evildoers who want to steal your RAM.,5
"This product came as described and worked perfectly. I consider all factors when ordering, including quality, price and company reputation. This product passed all. I can recommend this to others.While it is not by any means foolproof I do feel better. The install was a breeze.",5
"Just what I needed to protect my valuable stuff that I can't take with me.The security cable kits I bought didn't have good glue pads on the anchors, so I ordered more anchors and used the super-glue instead, with much better results.",5
"Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.",5
"This is exactly as I expected and as described. Simple to install. Sturdy &#34;module&#34; attachment via included Super Glue.  Cable is long enough for three items.  I ran mine through a large eye-screw in the wall to keep the systems from going anyplace.I suppose this item might deserve 5-stars - but, by necessity and function, it's not every attractive. Not really Kensington's fault on that.  But something ingenious would earn a 5th star :)",4
I share a house and always wonder if something might happen. These add extra security. Locks are meant to keep honest people honest. Of course any really determined thief will get them off but at least these will slow them down and maybe make them look for any easier target.,5
"Have a small home safe for documents and cash at home.  Wanted to create a deterrent to someone walking off with it.The outside of the small safe is plastic and the adhesive worked great on the case.  I now secure it to a fixed object and have some level of security.  Not many solutions out there for securing file safes to fixed object, that I could find.Great value, does the job.",5
Great for securing computer equipment.  Currently I purchased this to use in a hospital and was exactly what I was looking for.,5
"This is surprisingly the best power strip I ever had! I love it for many reasons, it's compact form, the color code system, I can fit all the chargers in without conflicting with each other!",5
This multi-outlet has a long cord (16') so we were able to make a charging area for 6 devices (and their respective adapters of all shapes and sizes) quite far from the outlet.  The product also looks nice enough to have out in plain sight.,5
Pros:* Heavy enough to stay where you put it.* Cord long enough to be useful.* More aesthetically pleasing than the long beige strips.Cons:* Octopus style wiring does not support most cord organization strategies.* Pricey.,5
This is the only one of my many surge protectors that has a 16 foot cord and I find that to be so useful.  I have had it for over a year and it is my favorite not only because of the cord length but also the compact size which is nicely balanced and able to easily accommodate six uniquely sized charger plugs.  I like this Kensington model so much that I have just purchased another as a gift.,5
"This is a nice looking and space saving 6 socket outlet. I replaced an old PowerSquid with this unit and it has worked as expected. I really like the color coded sockets and the circular design, which resulted in a smaller footprint.",5
"The Amazon page gives dimensions of the package. Here are some specifics regarding the product alone:15 oz: weight, not incuding cord, measured on my kitchen scales6.5 inches: Outside diameter of circular part2 inches or a little less: Height, with nothing plugged into itThe underside of the circular part is flat with six flat rubber legs/pads upon which it rests. Therefore, it does not slip on my granite countertop.Problem that this product solved: My kitchen and den are separated by a granite countertop, and on the den side my easy chair is backed right up to that countertop. I wanted sockets that could be accessed from either side, for cooking appliances (in the kitchen) or for plugging in my iPad or Kindle (while using them in the den). I can't imagine why an outlet wasn't thought of when my house was first built. I was going to call an electrician to add one, but this power strip seems to work just as well.How it solved my problem: The power strip does not budge or fall off the counter even when I am using the plugged in iPad. I could only make it slip off if I pulled it hard in a horizontal direction. The cord is long enough to reach the nearest wall outlet in the den. The price ($40+) seemed high a first, but getting an electrician out here would have cost a lot more.",5
I love the round design on this.  The design allows for you to use big plug in adapters and not have it take up another outlet.  I use this in my office and it works well.,5
This works perfectly for what I needed it for...it fits adaptors well and the circular shape is definitely welcomed verses just a strip.  This also has a long cord which is incredibly helpful!  Definitely a good buy!,5
"Used it in team gathering/meeting areas to allow multiple users quick, table-top access to power. The round format is nice for a centralized location.",4
"The current protection is good, the design is clever, and it feels much sturdier than my cheap-o power strips. But why does it cost $40??",4
"This circular outlet is perfect for the area under our oval conference table at work, where we hold many training sessions. We have used it for many months and not had any issues with it. It's heavy enough that it stays in place, and light enough that I can lean down, yank it over, plug in something and shove it back under the table without having to crawl underneath. It is very sturdy and seems to have taken all our (and our trainees') abuse without any problems. Perfect for areas where a long power strip won't work or would be less convenient.",5
"This does exactly what I needed: it provides a surge strip with plenty of room for transformer wall warts.Some of the pluses:1) The cord is nice and long and the plug is flat so it can go behind furniture.2) The outlets are color coded and it includes a couple of sets of corresponding color cord stickers you can put on device cords so you know what device you are unplugging when the cords all look alike.3) The device itself is actually smaller than it appears in the pictures. For me, that's good because it takes up less space. The footprint is roughly the size of a salad plate.4) Like most other plug strips, there are slots on the back to allow it to be mounted on a wall, the side of a desk or on the bottom of a shelf.I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",5
it is small enough to sit om my desk and large enough to hold all of my chargers  it eliminated the cord clutter on the desk and the colour code is fantastic and it is approved by ul and csa expensive but well worth it will recommed to my friends,5
"I already own one of these surge protectors and like it very much.  So when the need arose to purchase a second surge protector I went with another Kensington 62634.  For me the major selling point is the sixteen foot cord.I am very happy I purchased the same surge protector a second time.Today, 11-03-11 I finally became temporarily not lazy, opened the box.  It already has three outlets being used.I ordered another one but returned it when I found a better product by Kensington from another online store.  Of course the new model is much more expensive.",5
"This is a great power strip.  As many reviewers have pointed out, the design allows you to use ALL the sockets, as the sockets on standard rectangular power strips are often so close together that a plug for one device may block one or more sockets next to it.  It is also the most stable power strip that I own, as the round configuration keeps it solid on the floor exactly where you put it, even on carpet -- instead of leaning, lifting, and sliding around like many rectangular power strips (another plus that other reviewers have noted).  I also like the angled plug that plugs the power strip into the wall.  This allows the cord to point on an angle toward the floor, which helps conceal the cord and keep the power strip stable.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the cord that connects the power strip to the wall socket is too long.  I would have been happier with with an 18 to 24 inch cord, as opposed to several foot length of this cord.  Having all this extra cord to some extent defeats the purpose of what is otherwise an unobtrusive and compact power strip.",4
"I grabbed this quick on Cyber Monday not noticing it was a table top unit. I have too many electronics by my bed and had one of those small white strip surge outlets. The problem was 3 of the 6 items I charge there have those transformer big plugs so I hade to plug and unplug all the time. With this one I can plug in my decorative lamp, floor Ott light, alarm clock, tablet, nintendo DS and breathing machine. Everything is now neat and I don't have to keep switching things out. At most only 3 items are in use at one time. I like the quick on and off button I can lean over and hit should I choose to.The unit is very well made and I expect many years of good service from it.",5
"With a new HP touchscreen computer, I also needed a minimal footprint surge protector - this really answered my need on a modestly sized desk top.  Thank you Kensington.",5
"We recently placed this SmartSockets power strip under our conference room table.  It looks good and has plenty of room for some of those larger adapters.  We don't use or need the color coding, but it does add to the visual appeal of the unit in a professional setting.",5
"Well since most reviews have gone into the specifics of this device, I won't delve too deeply into those aspects. However, very rarely did I see any mention of how cheap of a device this is; the plastic feels of very low grade, the reset button litterally rattles it's so loose. Overall, yes the device works, so I won't knock it for that; unfortunately I have no means of testing the actual surge-protection, but I just have to hope that they used better quality electronic components then they used for the case build.Pros of the device:-----------------------+Smart circle design; obviously the main advantage of this is taht you are no longer limited by annoying power bricks taking up/blocking outlets. For that it works great.+Cute design; it looks slightly better than a normal surge protector with its circle form factor and brightly color coded outlets; however, the design is slightly hindered by how cheap the materials are, and looks less cute in person.+Long cord; 16ft is pretty long, so make sure you need that long of a cord, since the average cord length is around 6-8ft for a surge protector. Still for my application, a long cord is a plus (since I needed at least a 12ft cord).Cons:----------Really bad build quality; again, just super cheap plastic, and the reset button is really wobbly, barely feels like it's held on. The cord seems of decent gauge/insulation at least, and the device has some heft so it may just be cheap on the exterior.-No swivel outlet; for the cost of this device, it really should come with a swivel outlet connection, so if your outlet is upside-down (connected to a light switch) or you need it to go to the right of the socket, the cord will be tweaked in the wrong direction. I have no problems with cheap protectors not having a rotating outlet, but on something that costs almost $40 it really should have included it.Summary:-------Look, if we're rating the device on whether it provides power or not, of course it works, and should get 5 stars. The circle design is also very nice, and again worthy of some stars. But with how poor the build quality is on this (and this was ordered from Amazon directly, not 3rd party), and the fact that they didn't even throw in nicer features like a swivel socket for how pricey this retails for, I can't give this a fantastic rating (but will still give it an OK rating as it does in fact work, but that alone doesn't deserve 5 stars). I purchased the device on a Cyber-Monday sale, and even at the significantly-reducted price I'm still debating on if I should keep it or not. I have several surge protectors from all sorts of brands, and as such I'm somewhat disappointed with what should have been a nicer protector feeling and looking so cheap. I'd say for a sale price it might be worth it, or if you're really looking for a longer cord surge protector it might be worth it (although I have several longer-cord protectors that didn't cost near this much), but I've purchased much better protectors at even better prices when they go on sale.",3
"The circular design saves desk space and the extra long cord is helpful in setting up in an office cubicle. There is central power button that turns off all the items plugged into the colorful base. The colors are not the same, so different appliances can be assigned a different color. Useful if you have to unplug on device to use in another room or location.",5
I love this because of the sixteen foot cord.  So versatile in where you can use it.  Highly recommend to anyone!,5
"This works well on a conference table, like for class sessions with multiple laptops. Will hold 6 of the larger powersupply type plugs if needed. These come in handy. Functional as well as attractive with the different colors. The color scheme allows instant identification of cables with stickers that come with it.",5
"I bought this for use on my desktop. The shape makes it very convenient for use with power cords and the odd shaped transformer packs for cell phones, hard drives etc. The power switch on top is convenient if you want to shut it off to avoid wasting energy on the plugged in items when not in use. Nice long power cord, heavy base keeps it from moving around to much. Highly recommended.",5
"I am the very satisfied owner of the Palm V connected organizer. I had long wanted a hand held organizer, one that would have both computer interchangeable abilities and one that would be able to perform different applications. Christmas day was a happy one for me last year, not only because of the brimming smiles on my children's faces; but because that is when I received the Palm V as a gift from my Santa (my wife!).After giving the product and it's instructions a look over, within moments I was on my way and began the charging procedures necessary prior to it's use. This was my only initial disappointment, having to wait for the initial charging that takes 4 hrs. I couldn't wait to tinker with my new toy, and it was a bit annoying. After completing the charge up, I installed the cd that came with the product to familiarize myself with it. The cd is both quite informative and very easy to follow. Then I was ready to begin to learn about my new toy.Looks can be deceiving when it comes to the appearance of the Palm V. In viewing the device, with it's ultra sleek, thin design; one might come to the conclusion it could be nothing more than your basic address/date book. This little &quot;power packer&quot; (as I like to call it) is simply amazing!The applications that can be utilized with the Palm V as well as the storage capacities are as follows:1) Address book: that holds up to 6000 addresses2) Appointment record: that records up to 3000 appointments3) E-mail functioning: that can receive up to 200 e-mail messages4) Memo pad: that can hold up to 1500 memos5) To Do List: that records up to 1500 to-do items6) Expense Reports7) Games8) Security9) Calculator(All storage figures are approximate, and flexible according to the overall storage capacity of 2 MB)The Palm V also comes complete with the necessary software to facilitate all functions on the organizer. Other items that came with my Palm V were the synchronizing cradle &amp; battery recharger, the handbook, an adapter, a protective cover, and one metal stylus and a spare plastic one.While the Palm V comes to you with all the pre-programming stated in my epinion, it also has the capability of being able to receive downloads from the internet to expand its functions, or to simply download games to play on this hand held device.The ease of operation of the Palm V is remarkable. On it's face are are 5 buttons on the metal frame and an area on screen with 4 buttons (to be used with the stylus), as well as an area for information input or free hand graffiti writing. All of these help the user quickly and efficiently operate the Palm V to expedite the tasks at hand. The device also has a back light that can come in rather handy.Input of information into the Palm V can be done in a number of ways. One can access the keyboard on the device, or use special graffiti free hand writing to input the desired material. The device may also be directly hooked up to your PC and the information typed in with your computer's keyboard.The greatest thing about the Palm V is the ability to transfer data between the device and your computer. The ability to be able to access e-mail, download information from the internet or your computer, for me is a God send; and in my opinion nothing sort of revolutionary! To process the transference of information, the Palm V needs to be placed into the HotSync cradle. Then the user just presses the HotSync button on the device to perform the HotSync operation. It proves to be completely user friendly as far as the exchange between the organizer and the computer.Maintaining your organizer requires as little as a few minutes charging a day of the Palm V, by placing it in its cradle. No need to buy batteries, it is self contained with a Lithium ion rechargeable battery. It is so small in size and weighs a mere 4 ounces, it easily is carried in a coat pocket; both comfortably and unnoticed.My main use for the Palm V is during my business hours. It is always on my person, for me to access at a moment's notice, to jot down things I need to remember (which are many with my bad recall). Whether it be to record an appointment that I have just confirmed with a client, or a note to myself; the Palm V has become an invaluable device; one that has proven to make my day much more pleasant and hassle free. No more need to run to a desk for a paper or pen, or to ask my callers to hold on; I am always ready with my Palm V on hand.If you do not have any prior experience with a hand held organizer of this kind, and always thought about purchasing one, I would highly recommend the Palm V. Once you have had a device like this, you will never want to be without one. Just like all the modern luxuries in life, what you don't have you do without and don't miss; but what you've had and have no longer, is greatly missed and still desired for easier living. Thank you Palm V for making my life, just a little bit easier!",5
"A pretty good device overall, but one thing really bugs me.  I have it in a leather case.  I was carrying it in my hand one day and I dropped it.  Only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick, but the rest of the  device was cushioned by the leather.  That incident caused all the screen  touch points to drop.  In order to activiate something, I have to touch  below where it is displayed on the screen.  The functions on the bottom  moved almost completely out of range, and the writing area shifted down  also.  I can't tell if it's because the writing area shifted downwards, but  the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too.  I can't say  anything else bad about it, but what a letdown to know that it can't take  simple impacts.",3
"January 15, 2000  3Com's Palm PDA's are definitely the best PDA's on the market. You  can read the other reviews to hear how this device will help you organize  your life and how wonderful it is. As a Palm collector (I have all Palm  and Pilot models), I will rather compare the Palm V to the  Palm Vx. The  only difference between the two is that  the V has 2MB of RAM, while  the Vx has 8.I have thousands of addresses, thousands of appointments, and  many  more to-do items, documents, etc. in my Palm. I  also have fax, e-mail,  and internet software  installed, among many other programs. I only use  about  1.5 MB. Therefore, although I have the Vx, I don't use any of the  additional memory. Technically, because of the additional  memory, the  Vx is faster. Nonetheless, because Palm  applications are so small, this  difference is truly  negligible. Therefore, before you spend $100 more on  the Vx, make sure you're going to use the additional memory. It's the  only difference.Now, remember: the V  series is rechargable, while the III series uses  AAA  batteries. Therefore, travelling with a V palm means you'll have to  carry around the cradle. If you'd rather use batteries, maybe  the IIIx is  better for you.Good luck!",5
"A quick take on my perception of the good and bad points of this device, and some suggestions from a vetran Palm upgrader (I've returned and repruchased these machines a little too many times!)There are a few  things I love about this device:1. You don't end up changing batteries  all the time like you did with previouis models 2. It costs lesser than the  Palm Vx 3. Synchronization with outlook 2000 is flawless 4. The screen is  very readable in bright outdoors 5. The battery lasts and lasts (they  aren't energizer bunnies!)Things I do not like about this:1. The  choice of cases for this are kind of lousy. 2. Applications built into this  device could have been a little more intuitive.Overall perceptions:1.  Good value for the money 2. Buy a spare docking cradle if you move this  between home and work PCs (accompany sells them for dirt cheap if you are  in the right buying cycle) 3. Do not attempt to browse the Web on  this...you'll only be disappointed.",5
"I had trouble the first week getting the Palm to hotsync to my Thinkpad, and the Palm 5 even crashed once, losing all my data before the hotsync was working.Since then this thing has become an essential part of my life.  Works like a charm, both the Palm 5 itself and the hotsync too.  Address  book, calendar, notes...  The Palm is easily the best designed  hardware/software since the Macintosh of the late 1980's.By the way, I  am also using the Franklin/Covey software for personal management and find  this is a nice increment over the built-in daily task list of the Palm.",5
"I've had my Palm V since June 1st. To my brother, wife &amp; parents who conspired for my birthday: THANK YOU!!!!!  Within two weeks I abandoned my Franklin Planner, and regretted not having had a Palm device 15 years ago.  OK, that was impossible - but it has dramatically changed my life for the  better, and I can't imagine ever going without it. In the last several  months I have grown to be a very definite power user, and the corporate  resource person for Palm-platform PDA's. Our guys have tried several others  and are convinced that the Palm platform is the best and most flexible.  I  am very heavily into 3rd-party software evaluation (&amp; some  accessories), preparing recommendations for high-efficiency Palm  device/software packages for company-staff issue. Eventually I may put  together my own personal web-site, and post some evaluations and  recommendations for software/accessories for Palm users.Having said all  that, here's an engineer's (my)perspective on the Palm V: Visors will be  great, and Palm IIIx's are just fine, but the Palm V package size is  definitely worth a lot to me. Forget the sexy appearance - it's great, but  the superior Form Factor rules. Yes, I would prefer that the Vx cost is  about what the standard V discounts for now, but since it will ALWAYS fit  in my shirt pocket (without changing my shirt wardrobe) I ALWAYS have it  with me (in a place that's probably least susceptible to being damaged or  lost) - and that's what it's for. Though I prefer to use the slim padded  3COM case, I frequently slip the original leather flap-cover on for small  shirt pockets, &amp; thus can still carry a separate pen/pencil/stylus  device. A big plus with those covers that I've never seen in a review: the  soft ""grabby"" texture of the rubber-like spine flex keeps the Palm from  sliding, even if you do toe-touches. Ta-dah... it doesn't fall out on the  floor!!!!  (Very big benefit since the cover isn't a padded case.)Likes:  I like being able to keep synced with both my office laptop and my home  desktop (with the included MS Outlook Conduit)... autocharging in the docking  cradle... a battery that's never gotten below a half-charge... nice screen...  the size.  I really like the unit overall - a truly great device.Any  problems? Yep. I did have to get the updated e-mail patch from the Chapura  site to avoid some lock-ups when synching e-mail.  Also, I highly recommend  TealScript (the custom-tailorable graffitti add-on) for it's ability to  help you tune up your handwriting speed/recognition - and it visually  showed up a mysterious problem with the screen occasionally screwing up  handwriting by adding a horizontal line: 3-COM quickly replaced it under  warranty, and it's been fine.Memory space? The average user probably  will have no problem for a couple of years - I've met people with III's  that are using less than 1k... a year after they get it: they've seen &amp;  use very few aftermarket programs. However, I've got more programs in there  than will fit: launcher, datebook, calc &amp; memo replacements, travel  programs, doc reader, picture viewer, several clocks, a dozen utility and  security programs, over a dozen Hackmaster hacks, and a few games. Since  FlashPro gave me the extra 800k memory room (awesome), I found I probably  had enough that I could otherwise get by fine without deleting rarely-used  fluff programs - except that I use it heavily for work &amp; software  evaluation. The memory room of the Vx would be heaven - the perfect device,  I think. It'd be handy to carry a lot of maps, but my current standard P5  doesn't have the memory room without deleting, say, my picture viewer. (Oh,  the screen? It's great! Yes folks, it IS a 16 greyscale display!) Probably  I'll upgrade to the Vx &amp; give my wife my standard V (P5) unit: she  thought it was no big deal when I got it, but has fallen in love with the  capabilities and wants her own Palm device. Bottom line is that if you're a  minimalist, the 2k of P5 memory is fine. But if you like to carry a  Gerber/Leatherman/Swiss-Army device (like I do) because a pocketknife  leaves you unprepared... better get a Vx or get the 8mb upgrade on your  P5.Price? When Handspring comes out with something to compete with a Vx,  the price world will probably be great. Yeh, P5's are expensive compared to  some of the lesser PDA's - but compare the price to a palmtop computer, and  they look like a great deal... especially considering the impact on your  lifestyle.Can I mention my essential add-on programs list? Tough area,  but currently I wouldn't give up these - listed in order of descending  requirement: UnDupe (get it!), TealScript, Travel Clock, Hackmaster,  (SwitchHack, StayOffHack, PalmV hack, Invert Hack &amp; Invert, FindHack,  CatHack), DateBK3 (&amp; dbScan), BackupBuddy, IDPalm, FlashPro, a good  launcher - either Commander or LaunchEm have too many great enhancements to  do without. Must-have accessories: WriteRight screen covers, Throttle  Stylus/pen. I regard the PalmV hack and StayOff hack as absolute essentials  for Palm V users, and Invert with InvertHack give proper screen display  when the backlight's on.  In-depth info?  O'Reilly's ""Palmpilot: The  Ultimate Guide"" is a fantastic reference for ALL Palm owners.",4
"I finally decided to spend the extra $$ for the Palm V and give my old Palm III to my dad.  Afterall, I loved the styling, but more importantly wanted the slimmer size.Unfortunately, when you use the hard cover that comes with the Palm V and put it in your pocket, it causes the power button  to turn on and then the up/down key constantly clicks.  Huh?So then I  went out and got the hard case (a rip off if you ask me), causing the  Palm V to be just as thick as my Palm III.  That left me wondering why I  bothered spending all that extra money to get a Palm no smaller than the  one I already had.Dad, can I get my Palm III back?",3

"The $ I put down for my Palm V are some of the best dollars I've ever spent. Really.Prior to my Palm V, I had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere, all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when I needed them most. As a result,  I often forgot to do things that needed to be done, lost important phone  numbers, etc.-you get the idea.My Palm V changed everything. Now I keep  everything important, from the standard addresses, to do's, notes, and  appointments to my accounting info, stock portfolio, and local movie times  (thanks to AvantGo.com) all on my Palm V, and it's GREAT!A warning to  those buying Palm V's, though. It takes time to get used to it! I hated  grafiti (the &quot;handwriting&quot; you must use for the Palm to recognize  your input) at first, and found the miniscule on-screen keyboard a pain.  Additionally, I saw no real point in keeping a to do list and ALL my  appointments on the thing. After a month of forcing myself to do so,  however, I was hooked! After really taking the time to get familiar with  the thing, I use it on the order of twenty times a day--far more than I've  used any other device (digital or old-fashioned pen and paper).So, my  buying advice: buy one! Palm V's are absolutely fantastic, really! They're  beautifully designed (you won't feel geeky pulling one out!) and the  handiest things in the world. I promise! (Be sure to buy one of the hard  cases to keep it beautiful.)",5
"The Palm V and Vx may have seemed totally awesome, but I never fell for the hype. The Palm V and Vx have a rechargeable lithium battery. When it's day is done, there's an agonizing choice: go for a replacement one of these, have the battery replaced and risk it not working correctly, or buying something that as one user suggested could run off of easily replaceable AAA batteries. The Palm V and Vx were never cool enough to overcome that stigma for me. If you can find that the Palm V/Vx has an acceptable set of trade offs and opportunity cost, to quote a drop dead gorgeous economics teacher I had, then it is definitely the belle of the ball. If on hand B you are practical, and want more steak and less sizzle from your handheld, the Palm VII or Palm VIIx may be a far better option.Just alerting you to something the positive reviews may gloss over.",2
"When I hear PDA, I would like to now envision a device that may look roughly like the Palm V, but has a lot more packed in it. Palm V is an excellent device and it is a great buy for the sake of the technology's first step.But, after using it for about a year now, I am being selfish. I want more memory, I want color, I want sound and I want a floating connection to the rest of the world. So, my advice - when you buy a PDA, go for something with at least color and more memory (for the sake of technology's next step). You are going to run out of the Palm V's 2MB if you are like me and like to download all those available applications. Palm Vx has 8MB memory which should be enough for the time being, but I want more (Sorry !).I am looking at the PDA to be the materialisation of Isaac Asimov's vision of a hand held device which is carried by everyone in the world and has a unique identification number. So if you want to talk to your sister, just punch in her id number and there she is on the screen looking at you and yelling at you for buzzing her when she was in the shower !! Our privacy is going to be under fire, but it is going to be fun all the same. Asimov said that by 2010, this will be a reality. And, the world is fast getting there. Palm V is only an initial step !! My advice - go for the next step.",4
"Using my Palm V always makes me smile because it is about as close to perfect as any electronic device I've ever used.If anyone is on the borderline, not sure if a PDA is for them, this device will not disappoint.  It does everything that you'd want it to do, does it well, and does it  quickly.  Plus the ability to sync the Palm V with your computer's PIM  (inc. Microsoft Outlook) makes importing and exporting contacts a  breeze.If you're not sure about the Graffiti writing system, I can tell  you that it's a very easy to learn.  Five minutes worth of practicing and  you'll have it down (it's very, very close to the normal alphabet).  After  a few days you'll have it completely memorized (the Palm folks also include  a handy &quot;cheat sheet&quot; sticker that you can stick to the inside of  the cover that's included with the Palm V).As someone who bought an  Apple Newton MessagePad (and lived though that debacle) I can say from  experience that the Palm is not a product that only a geek can love.  Anyone who is busy and wants to be able to keep track of contacts and  appointments will find this device invaluable and I sincerely mean that.  Once you have one you will not want to be without it, and it sure beats  hauling a fat old paper based organizer around.Some quick notes; the  Palm V Hard Case rocks!  If you travel a lot make sure to get one.  It  keeps the Palm V completely safe from harm and looks beautiful.  Also, with  the upgrade to Palm OS 3.3, you'll be able to sync your Palm with any  laptop with an infrared port without the need for any cables.  This is  very, very cool and very useful for road warriors (one caveat here, the IR  sync does not yet work on Windows2000 based systems).Hope this helps!",5
"Well, it has taken three weeks and three different online companies to get the Palm V to me.  Was it worth the wait?  You bet...although it's a bit pricey due to the shortage of flash ram and LCD screens.  After filling up  my address book, downloading e-mail and news (through AvantGo), as well as  various applications and games I still have about 768K left.  2MB may seem  like a small amount of storage to some people, but it goes a long way as  long as you manage your e-mail, games, and amount of AvantGo channels you  read.  The HotSync operation only takes a few minutes, and I spent a total  of five minutes learning the alphabet and numbering system of the graffiti  language.  Once fully charged, the battery never seems to diminish no  matter how much I use it.  Even though the Palm V did not come with a nice  checkbook program, I found a free one immediately at download.com.  Now  that the US version is sold out in most places, I would highly recommend  considering the international version as it seems like it is virtually the  same as the US version with an international AC adapter.",5
"This Christmas I decided to treat myself to a Palm computer. After reading the specs on the Palm V and the Palm IIIe, I decided to buy the Palm IIIe. It seems that the only differences are about $200, the Palm V has Flash RAM  making it upgradeable, the cool look of heat blasted anodized aluminum. I  got a soft full-grain black leather case, which makes the Palm IIIe look as  cool as the Palm V. I feel that the Palm IIIe is more portable because you  can get AAA batteries anywhere and do not have to rely on the cradle /  charger. The funny thing is that I'm still using my Casio SF-4985ER Digital  Diary with 256 KB memory for my electronic organizing needs.",3
"I was skeptical about using the Palm, but once I started it quickly became indispensible.  I have eight large rolodex files on it plus tons of memos and 'to do' items.  The 2mbyte of memory is still handling it with no  problem.  .........GIVE IT FIVE STARS!",5
"I can't believe this can still be reviewed.  I don't have much to say, but I have a few old contacts still on my ten year old Palm that I still havent transferred over.  I know.  The point is that my Palm sits in my drawer and always powers on perfectly.  I don't think I have even charged it in a few years.  This thing is amazing in its longevity.",4
I have found a few places that will do memory upgrades for all the Palm's. 8M seems to be the max.,5
"I bought one of these for my husband as an early Father's Day present, and he loves it. He says &quot;because it's small and convenient, it's always there so you can make quick notes as needed. It's perfect for keeping track  of incidental expenses much more easily than fumbling with notes and  remembering things.Another nice feature is that using the HotSynch  connection, the PP easily transfers information back and forth from  computer to the PP itself. This is especially effective when one uses  Outlook, and the PP will even allow you to write and store email which will  automatically be sent later, if you choose.&quot;He loves this thing,  uses it all the time, and it certainly makes him more organized. His last  word on it is:&quot;I should have bought one a year ago!&quot;Go for  it folks, you won't be disappointed.",5
"My Palm V was wonderful, and I replaced it immediately when it was stolen--Probably the best argument that I really got good value from it!  I had not used any form of portable computer, PDA, or similar device before,  but after just a few months I found mine indispensible.  I chose the Palm V  over the other Palms, and over any Windows-based system because of the  sliim profile. I can put it in the front pocket of my slacks and it is not  obtrusive. The usefulness of the built-in functions for keeping to-do  lists, addresses, and calendars is obvious.  Less obvious is using all the  downloadable software available on the internet--Often for free, but more  often at a modest price, at least for the really useful stuff. I use the  calendar book function in a way I suspect the designers didn't intend--I  enter reminders to myself for a set date and time, so my alarm will go off  and the Palm will display a message such as &quot;Call Norman now.&quot;  I  also find the Search function very useful.  If I remember that I dealt with  Norman, but have forgotten his phone number or last name, I can have the  Palm search for &quot;Norman&quot; and display his name and address  (assuming I entered it when I first talked to him) as well as any notes or  memos I wrote about our discussion. You can do this for any word or name,  so if I remember discussing widgets with a guy, but have forgotten his name  or phone or company, I can search for &quot;widgets&quot; and again  everything I've entered on the subject will be available.  In fairness, I  have to say that if you don't have a fairly busy life, you may not have  much use for it, but if your life is a busy one, I predict you will find  the Palm V (or Palm Vx) invaluable. This includes people who aren't  &quot;high-powered executives.&quot;  Stressed--out students or overwhelmed  homemakers will find it useful.",5
"This was one of Palm's real groundbreaking handhelds, with it's sleek case and low weight.  Still a great handheld but only has 2 MB of memory and lacks the SD slot that the new Palms are being manufactured with.  If you just need a calendar and address book, this will do it, but the m100 will do just about the same (...)(with albeit a much smaller screen).  The backlight on the Palm V is woeful like the backlights on all Palms, but is not needed too often.",4
"Ive gone from the palmpilot pro two years ago to the palm III and now have the Palm V, so I definitely appreciate how small and thin the V is, and how much clearer the screen is than on the previous models. A few months ago my  palm V fell from a stack of books on to the floor face down, shattering the  screen.  I called 3com, and they charged me 100 dollars to replace it, and  sent a refurbished one that came in two days.  I was satisfied with the  process, and its good to know that they understand how important it is to  be back in action fast as possible.The leather flip cover that comes  with the V works very well to protect the screen while in your pocket, and  eventually begins to have the comforting worn leather feel of a wallet,  which adds to the over aesthetics of this product.  A less obscure point is  that it becomes very easy to get attached to carrying the palm V around  just as much as you carry a wallet.I can use the infrared port on the  palm V to connect to my GSM phone (ericsson i888 on omnipoint), and get  regular internet access.  (requires proxinet, irdalink software, and a  standard isp).  Its not the most functional thing in the world- but it  actually works.  There is so much good shareware out there for the palm  (tetris, document readers and books, finance calcs, customizing hacks  etc.), and even a computer novice can easily learn how to download and  install new programs with relative ease.",5
"I was forced to buy the aluminum case for my P-V because the power would consistently come on while it was in my pocket.If you intend to carry this around as a pocket device, you'll be stuck with investing in a case...  beware.",4
"Although the Palm V is more appealing than the III it's essentially the same technology. I've had one wear out and die, another just fail and &quot;reboot&quot; itself alot, another fail from getting a little wet. I  love these things but for me the extra $150 for the V translates into $175  per year vs $100 per year, assuming it lasts two years.",4
"I owned a Palm III for a while when it came out, and then stepped up to the V after about a year with my III. What can I say? I was allured by its sexiness and general asthetic appeal.I have now relied on it for about a  year for all my organizing needs. I have used every part of the Palm  Software suite except the expense reporting feature.While I like the  Palm V's style, I have become more and more disappointed by its features  and memory issues.Features: lacks decent sound for starters, a beep is  boring and weak. When I carry the Palm in its home (my pocket) I cannot  hear the alarm tones even with volume maxed! The screen is a mixed bag.  While its clarity is better than other organizers, it is very hard to read  in slightly dim areas because the backlighting leaves a lot to be desired.  Battery power is okay, but not anywhere near the advertised time of 30  days.Memory is a whole different issue. All I have on my palm is some  1500 addresses and 1000 calendar entries and it tells me I am half full, as  you know they advertise a lot more capacity. I don' use but a couple of  aftermarket programs.The Graffiti recognizer is crap. When it works it  puts the wrong letters on the screen. Real users need to get Jot! from  CiC.Palm, Inc.'s tech support is the WORST! Most of their support staff  can hardly speak English; so imagine them trying to explain a highly  technical issue! Whats more, they don't even care. I was pormised a return  call - had to call back. I have not once ever received a real response by  email - only autoresponders that say &quot;24-48 hours&quot; - still  waiting on my inquiry from January!In short, save a little longer and  get the Cassiopeia E-115 (when it comes out). In my experiences with  head-to-head comparrisons of Cassiopeia E-105s to my Palm V, the Cassio was  a true frontrunner! The E-115 will certainly be even better! If you need a  great datebook and address book to keep you straight and don't need sound,  memory, genuine Word Processing, or Spreadsheet, or color screen then GO  WITH THE PALM V!  But if you need features and real performance, get a  Windows CE Device.",3
"I needed one centralized location for all my information, especially appointments and phone numbers.  The Palm V has given me exactly that.  I've installed a couple of shareware applications, but have not found that  I use them, so the 2 MB memory is going to be fine for me.  The interface  is elegant and simple, and it's easy to input data with the stylus.  After  using the included cover, and then trying the leather case, I finally ended  up with the hard case, and I like it the best.  All the Palm users who talk  about how it has changed their lives are not just blowing smoke.... this  device has succeeded where countless paper organizers and calendars have  failed.  And it's fun, and looks cool!",5
"The Palm V is one of those electronic gizmos you don't think you'll ever need, and then when you get one you can't live without it. I've been carrying mine around like a pacifier.  When someone stops me on the street  and wants to set up and appointment I used to take their number and check  my calendar back at the office.  Now I can take their number AND make the  appointment.3Com has packaged a proven product in a sexy case and come  up with a real winner.",5
"I received my Palm Vx in 2001. It is now March of 2008, and I am still actively using it. I am so very grateful. There have been some scary times when I thought the end had arrived, but I was wrong. The problem ended up being so crazy. A button was stuck. Consequently, the unit would run out of juice and not charge. Once I figured that out, I have been able to revive it without much incident. I have read many of the reviews about the Tungsten E2 and am quite discouraged about buying it. Thus, I will continue to offer life support as long as this Palm Vx allows. It has served me so very well!!",5
"I spent about 2 months trying to decide whether an organizer could be worth this much money.  I just bought my Palm V last week, and it's hard to imagine life without it now.  The Palm V is simply the best purchase I've made in a long time. It's an incredibly small and sleek little machine.  It  fits right in your shirt pocket, even with the hard case I bought for it.  It has all the standard things you'd expect from an organizer (address  book, to do list, agenda, expense report).  The Graffiti system (writing  instead of typing) only takes a little while to get used to.  The Palm  Desktop software and cradle allows you to back everything up in a few  seconds.  No batteries are necessary, because you can recharge the Palm Vin  the cradle.  Hundreds of extra programs and games can be downloaded. If  you're trying to decide which Palm to buy, I definitely recommend the V.  The Vx is about the same, but it has more memory (which I don't think I'll  need) and costs a lot more, the III series is great but not as sleek, and  the VII has the built-in modem, which doesn't interest me much.  Go for the  Palm V.  If you're trying to decide whether it's worth the money, the  answer is a resounding YES!",5
"I love my Palm V!  I won it over the internet and now I don't leave home without it!  Very simple to use and EXTREMELY useful.  I store telephone numbers, my date book, grocery lists, myriads of other lists for work and home, and just yesterday I downloaded a trial copy of SplashPhoto that lets me show a slide show of family pictures on my Palm V.  A GREAT electronic toy!!!",5
Great and slightly more sturdy version of the popular Palm. I like the metal casing. I hate the fact that when you put the unit in your shirt pocked it is very easy to create pressure on the buttons and pretty soon the device is scrolling and clicking away.,5
perfect,5
"I love these inserts.  I used to print on cardstock and cut out my own labels.  My lines never turned out straight and I always ended up with inserts that were too large or too small.  With these, I end up with a great looking label label that fits perfectly",5
"In the product description, it might have been helpful to mention that the software isn't available for Mac....I'm going to attempt to figure out another way to get it done using these, but not sure if I'll be able to...",2
"I needed to read the description better. However I feel I need to say that this paper is pretty much like a thicker printer paper, not really cardboard or glossy. And the printing comes out rather flat. of course I have used Memorex before, but have always used glossy before, so they make great products, but this one is pretty much of no use to me. But it's mainly my fault for not reading more carefully.",3
Fast delivery and great product,5
Product does exactly what I need and the price works very well for me! Will keep on buying these for as long as I need to...,5
ummm the paper is slightly thicker than regular paper. it never jammed my printer. it has perforated lines for folding but it didnt work out like that for my printer. maybe i aint doing something right but to gets the job done so whatever,4
I'm slowly getting my program cd's into jewel cases and needed a way to label them.  I'm going far too slowly to try doing the labels on a computer and am hand-lettering them.  They fit well and do what I need to do.,5
"These days, people seem to have forgotten what jewel cases are, but these inserts are a definite step up from the scissors and printer paper method. They don't look especially good or fit better than adequately, but they are better than....see above.",3
"I read the many reviews here on this product before ordering and was somewhat concerned that so many seemed to have a problem with the software. I found the software to be easy to use although like my disc label burning software(fellows/neato), I had to experiment a little to figure out how to align pictures of the DVD covers/inserts correctly. I spent maybe 10 minutes and then began printing(I use standard paper to figure out the alignment issues as to not waste the actual covers/inserts). Some have said they would like a glossy paper option and I agree. This paper gives a somewhat dull picture quality but I still find it to be OK. If I has the option for glossy paper I would purchase that instead. I back up mostly movie DVDs and would like a more brilliant quality output. If I were backing up data DVDs, I would not have an issue with the paper quality. I have not used any other brands so I cannot, at this time, give a contrasting opinion of other products. I plan on trying other products though to see if any others do a better job for my movie DVD cover/insert needs. I will update later as I get more data on this subject. For now I'll say these covers are a good value for the money.",5
These labels are perfect for what they are supposed to do and are pre fit exactly to the space provided and are exactly what I was shopping for.,5
I have tried an awful lot of CD inserts and these are by far the most cost effective and functional.  I just love them.,5
"The template prints a little off and these are pretty much just pieces of cardstock paper, but for a cheap insert these are good. They tear off of the sheet easily and fit perfectly in jewel cases.",4
"These are fine.  They are not glossy, but they are measured right and very good for home made covers of DVDs and CD's,  There were some whiny reviews, but remember they are not pro photo paper.  They work just fine though and look good.",5
i will definitely be back to get more of these i like these because they are easy to work with.,5
I have a recording studio so I make a lot of CD's. Most of my artists gives me the information they want on the CD & Jewel Case Insert & I do the rest. I hope Memorex never stops making these inserts & Amazon never stop carrying them. I go through several thousand a year.,5
Purchased as a gift for daughter. She was very satisfied with quality and the colors to help her arrange her music by catagory.Good price and Great Seller...prompt ship.,5
"These jewel case inserts worked very well, but what makes this a 5-star is the software from Memorex that makes it easy to set the titles and import pictures.  They also supply you with many interesting backgrounds for your labels and jewel case inserts.  This is the same software for the CD labels, so it makes it easy to learn.  I was able to supply our kids with DVDs of them as children, each with their individualized jewel case and DVD label.  Made a great Christmas present.",5
"Very easy to use and they fit very well. Good, cheap labels that work very well with my printer. Thanks!",4
"The title of my review says it all. I am running a very old Jewel Case designsoftware program. Nevertheless, this product works perfectly and producesvery professional looking results.",5
These labels are great for CD's and DVD's. The labels have perforations in the paper to give excellent neatness that gives your projects a professional look. Great for thin and thick media holders.,4
"As two previous posters have mentioned, there's a problem with this product -- there's no template readily available for their use. The packaging directs you to a Memorex site that is defunct. You can search and find a third-party program that promises it will do what you need, while also installing potentially harmful adware on your computer as well. I would not install it as it seemed unsafe. I tried contacting Memorex, but go no response. This left no real options for their use.I needed to print my inserts ASAP, though, and didn't have time to find something else so I divised a template of my own -- with trial and error, it worked, more or less. It was VERY time consuming, though. Memorex should pull this product off the shelves if they aren't going to legitimately support it.",1
These worked very well first time and every time so far on my printer. I'd been printing my inserts on 25-pound paper before so these are a vast improvement; the perforations make it easy to separate the parts.,5
"I love the grade of the paper and ease of perforated edges makes it easy to insert and look ""pro""... you can find the templates online at the memorex referred website..I only wish they had a more professional grade Photo Paper, it would definitely be worth whatever extra cost.... even a 10 pack of paper! possibly a better ""economy"" template as well, so I don't waste so much of the 8 X10",5
"Memorex is a brand name that does offer excellent product support, and certainly this product is excellent for two reasons. First, because it's easy to use. Cover art from CD's that have missing artwork can be relatively easily dropped into the blank template software provided at the Memorex website, and you can create cover art that functionally replaces the missing original artwork inside the jewel cases for your CD collection. Where it gets tricky - if darn near impossible - is creating the rear front insert printing. But if you're looking to put a cover and a tray insert in quick and fast this is the product.The instructions for creating cover art that looks decent or retail-presentable is very spare if not available at all. Part of the reason for this is that 99% of all retail CD cover art and jewel case inserts are printed on glossy paper and not the type of paper that ships with this product. The Maxell product, however, is on matte paper. This requires attention to detail when selecting inkjet printer settings, as you want to use the amount of ink that is usually dispersed for, say, a matte greeting card. If you use the incorrect setting, you can often spoil the insert by using entirely too much ink and creating a ""wavy"" effect in the art that will doom your intentionally perfect effort to the waste bin. So do a few test runs before you make a final copy - or at least expect you'll use 4-5 to get used to the product if it's the first time you're making cover art.The format of the pre-printed and pre-perforated sheet is excellent, however. But there are some bits of advice worth considering when removing the cover art. As the manufacturer indicates, you will want to fold along the seams that need to be torn in order to get a somewhat clean cut from the 8.5"" x 11"" sheet. You won't get the seamless cut you get, say, from Avery business card stock of the premium variety, but you'll get an acceptably clean cut if you follow this rule.Also be careful not to tear the perforations on the rear art that are meant to be where the folds are. I did this on the first sheet and had to repeat!The software enables you to line up the different edges of the original cover art to the template itself - but as with anything on a printer, make sure your printer is lined up correctly with the paper so you don't have any overlap. My advice is to slightly oversize the original art (easy to do if you have a basic understanding of image editing software) so that you can be sure you have a complete piece of art without white edges on top, bottom, or either side. It takes some tweaking - it's not as simple as just dragging, dropping, and printing.All that said, this product is more than adequate - software and inserts - for making gift mix CD's. The intuitive software guides you through the processes of creating cover art with either custom or stock image backgrounds, and placing track lists on your inserts. In fact the software is so useful, I am considering the use of the software with my own sheets sourced from another paper supplier, and then cutting the art myself from standard sheet stock.In short this product is adequate for replacement of cover art of value-priced CD's to be sold at retail, or to give a faceless CD a new jewel case home for your personal collection. But if you're looking for perfection in recreating major record label quality cover art, then look elsewhere. Alternatively if you are making your own CD's to be jewel cased as gifts or to create DVD ROM cover art for custom projects - business or personal - this would be an excellent product. For example creating a professional portfolio or storage cases for personal media would be two excellent uses for this product. Since I have almost one hundred of these sheets, I'll work my way through them. But because I have customers who demand near-retail-new perfection in their purchases, I am going to have to begin a thorough search for a product that maintains more of that specific aesthetic.On value and price this is an excellent product - certainly much cheaper than the retail locations where I had seen them locally. And again if you're using these for personal data storage, home-made products, or whatnot, these are excellent. That said they provide an exacting and demanding customer an ersatz product, that, if printed on a low DPI printer, can appear even - dare I say - kitschy.But with Amazon Prime offers and excellent delivery, I'm not throwing stones at retailers - just letting consumers know that if you're looking for what I was looking for - replacement cover art with the aesthetic of that of the major record labels, you'll need to do a little more digging out on the market for a good fit.",3
"I got these to label 40 Dvds that I was mailing out for a fundraiser convention. Creating the design wasn't too horribly difficult. But after printing, it took a few minutes EACH label, to tear out and put together into a CD case. I wasn't expecting the puzzle... There are several different tear-lines; you end up with more ripped off bits and pieces then actual pieces for the case. Then getting it to go together in the case was like a game. If I had just been making a personal cover/label for my own dvd, it wouldn't have seemed like such a hassle. But making 40, I had to do it over the course of 3 days. It was quite tiring.I guess, for the price I paid, they at least got the job done. But don't expect an easy process, is all I'm saying. I felt like I 'signed up' for something I hadn't quite bargained for... 'Course, I've also never assembled my own cd cover before, so it could very well be like this with all of them.",3
Software that you download is a little tricky but once you get used to it it works as it says.  Paper isn't the heaviest of card stock but that's ok.  Serves its purpose.  I would buy again.,4
"I used these to make covers for slim lined cd jewel cases. The photo and music list lined up perfectly, without adjustment because I used Memorex jewel cases. The only issue I had was with the design software. I never could figure out how to import the list from my burn program into the templet for the covers. All the icons and instructions were clear, but the did not work. I could see the list download from the cd in the drive, and it showed up in the software library, but it would not insert into the proper frame on the cd cover.  Ended up typing it in manually. Also missing was any button to control the layers between the text and the photo. it defaults to placing text first then inserting your photo. I could not find a way to bring the text to the foreground. So I reversed the process, placing the photo first and then the text on top.The paper quality was thick enough for use in the slim case, however I wish it had a gloss to it. The photo came flat and a bit muted, even after changing out all the ink in the printer.Used this for a give away music cd for a party. It was fine for what I was doing, however I would not use it on a professional work project.",4
"As a network administrator in an enterprise enviornment I agree that generally you wouldn't use this card in a corporate enviornment.  But large companies buy products in bulk and they get the deals that the everyday user doesn't get.  But, in all honesty you could probaly run this card with no problems on an enterprise level network -- the performance is great especially for $15.But for general networking in a medium sized/soho enviornment you can't beat it.  This card seems to work with every system I have installed it on -- no matter the platform or OS.Its cheap, well documented, and easy to install.  Is there anything else really to say?",5
Others have written about poor manuals and shoddy components.  This might be true.  I'm not a beginner with network software or hardware but I'm hardly a pro either.  I had zero problems installing this (manual seemed  fine to me) and haven't had any problems using it since.  BTW I use it to  hook into my DSL connection.  If it didn't work I'd just send it back  (Amazon's always been great about this).  And the price is just too hard to  pass up.,5
"I have 3 of these nic's running here at home and I also have a 10/100 4-port hub from Netgear. It was so simple to install. I tried another brand  nic first and could not get my computer to boot up on them. I took them  back and got Netgear FA-310TX. Plugged them in and it worked the first  time. I don't know about you, but I hate &quot;hard to install  hardware&quot; A great buy at Amazon... !  I need one more so I am buying  it here. Thank's Amazon",5
"I'm moderately comfortable with my PC's innards, but I'm no hardware guru. Therefore, I was extremely pleased when this card installed with the ease the documentation (and other Amazon reviewers) promised. The low price was icing on the cake.",5
"Ok...the fellow that reviewed several before me made a good point.  You don't want to use this in an enterprise environment...DUH!  I'm an MCSE and I wouldn't recommend this card to any company, BUT, for the home there is  absolutely nothing wrong with this card.  It works and you can get 2 or 3  at the price of one of those big dog names.  Do those work 2-3 times  better?  No, they don't.  I have 3 PC's of my own at home...6 altogether in  there and all have different NIC cards.  NetGear performs just as well as  the others and I wouldn't complain if I had one of their cards in every one  of those machines.So, in short, setting up a corporate LAN/WAN?  Then  don't pick up one of these cards.  Got a couple of computers or just one  and want to play network games with friends...save a few bucks and go buy  one of these and use what you saved on something else.",3
"Simply put, the Netgear FA310TX works. It is an extremely simple card, but not much is required in a ethernet card. Those of you needing WOL support (why?!) should not purchase this card, as it does not support it. The speed and throughput is consistant with more expensive cards, my LAN does not require speeds up to 100Mbps anyway, but it is good to know it is there. The cards are good priced, so it will not cost much to outfit a small network with these cards, I have one in every desktop in our LAN. They work, what more could you ask?",5
"Can't be any finer with how compatible it is, and how bullet proof they made these.  I'm glad that these were available still, they are prefect for 100Mbps network access.  I wish they would get into fiber at a systematic speed sheet.",5
"I use this card for my home network, and it has never given me trouble. I reccomend it for people wanting to quickly get a home network up and running. Provided you pay attention to the network configuration requirements for your particular OS, this card is most unlikely to give you trouble. If you think you have a card problem carefully recheck your config work a few times first before blaming the card.This card works great in Red Hat Linux AND Windows. It is the only Netgear card certified for Red Hat Linux 7. As a matter of fact I'm ordering a 4th FA-310TX card to replace a Linksys card right now. I'm involved in Linux and am presently converting an Emachines box to a 100% Red Hat Linux 7 machine. I ran into trouble with the Linksys FastEthernet 10/100 (Version 2) card in this box. It turns out Red Hat 7 can see that card, but not the Linksys chip, so I need to replace it. End of my use of Linksys cards (but they work just great in Windows networks and I have a complete Linksys-based network running for a client as well.) I'll probably stick to Netgear in the future.",5
"Work well in Linux, 98, ME, NT and Win2K.  I use these cards and the Linksys PCI cards all over my network, both work great.",5
"This NIC is very robust as it is easily installed in any Windows computer or even a Linux box.  Netgear's website is done very well, in which you can get tech support issues resolved quite easily.I never had to contact tech support due to any of their items that I have purchased.  Their web site support is superb.I highly recommend any of Netgear's products.",5
"I work in Cable Modem operations. We have some  customers who buy cheap, and often problematic NIC's, ony to face hours of endless troubleshooting on NIC issues. The NetGear FA-310 is one of their biggest problems. Made of  flimsy greenboard and &quot;? &quot; type Chinese components, NetGear's  crusade of inexpensive NIC's has made a joke of consistentcy. The price may  be attractive, yet you would be hard-pressed to find any company who would  commit to using NetGear NIC's throughout their operation: Simply because  the service and quality is inconsistent. NetGear's customer support is  short of laughable, as well.You get what you pay for. From my point of  view, I would avoid NetGear, Linksys, or any other &quot;Off-Brand&quot;  NIC and consider looking for one more dependable. You may pay a little more  for a 3Com, Intel, and SMC, but they are worth the price. They offer the  consistency and stability every NIC user should demand - Not just a  discount price.",2
"I have bought over 5 of these for home and office use. They work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality. I was running Windows 95 or Windows 98 on all the computers.  Setup was a snap.  Just pop in the card to an empty slot.  Then install the drivers from the floppy disk that comes in the package.  Worked flawlessly everytime.  I had no problems hooking up the ethernet card to a Linksys DSL/Cable Router, Netgear ethernet hubs, or a college dorm ethernet connection.Get this card and you will get the convenience of file and print sharing when used in conjunction with some sort of hub and windows network neighborhood.  Anyone with little to no computer expertise can do this just by following the instructions.  It may be a little difficult if you are scared of computers, but it can still be done.  Just follow the pictures that come on the step by step setup foldout.",5
"I took this hub out of the box, plugged it in, connected it to our internal network and my two PC's about two months ago, and it has worked  flawlessly ever since.  All without reading the manual!  This hub is  perfect for me because I occasionally attach a legacy 10Mbps device and  don't need more than three ports (other than to link to our existing  network).One warning - if you have other Netgear hubs and equipment,  keep the power supplies separate.  I had a single-speed 100Mbps hub and got  the power supplies mixed up.  The unit looked like it was working but  actually wasn't.  The power supplies look similar, the plugs are the same,  but I think the current and/or voltages are different.Other than that,  this is a great product.  As I said earlier, it just works.  When you  factor in price, you can't miss.",4
"This is a network &#34;hub&#34;, not to be confused with a network &#34;switch&#34;.  A switch and a hub basically do the same thing, except a hub sends all traffic through every port whereas a switch is more intelligent and only sends traffic to the port that is required to reach the intended destination.  Therefore, a switch almost always provides better performance.  A switch is probably what you actually want.This hub does exactly what it is supposed to.  Every connected device can see the network packets sent by every other connected device, which allows you to analyze the packets if you so choose.",5
This is a great hub. Work well. This is part of my first network that I installed myself. I used all Netgear compnents and I am pleased with the simplicity of the installation. Just plug and go. I do recommend the  Netgear FA310TX Nic's also.,5
"I got this hub in the mail, plugged in the power, plugged it in to my DSL modem, plugged by PC and laptop into it, and everything just worked!  No configuration or anything (despite my DSL setup), basically no problems of any kind.  Can't beat that!",5
"These days, there is almost never a reason to buy a hub...  For most applications, everyone should be buying a switch.I just bought for of these for our lab, because nothing beats a hub for allowing you to sniff network traffic when debugging network software.For someone wanting a REAL hub, the DS104 is a real hub!",5
"I needed another Ethernet Hub for a software development project I'm working on.  Hubs are difficult to find these days as low cost network switches are a dime a dozen, and provide isolation between network ports.But for network hardware development you do not want this isolation when you are trying to monitor network traffic between devices.  That is where an Ethernet Hub comes in.  Yes you can use ""managed"" network switches but those are more expensive than the garden variety network switch.This Hub was available at a fair price, and works fine.  If I need another one I would purchase again.",5
"While I have never really found huge differences in hubs based on the name brand, I have generally been very happy with this Netgear Hub and my new Netgear Router.  It is built very solid (which is not true of all hubs) and seems to stand up well to some heavy use.  (I'll sometimes have to take it into work and I move it around frequently when I rearrange my office...so it gets more `mileage' than most hubs!)The one weakness I've found with Netgear is the Tech Support.  Their web site is not the most user-friendly site and it can be a bit of an effort to find a driver or anything.  But it is all there and you can get PDF copies of the manuals and such, so that is helpful.  The one time I've had to contact Netgear phone support (related to a wireless network card) it was not impressive at all.  But for this hub, you should have no need for Tech Support and it is an excellent hub.",4
"I bought this hub to connect the computers in my home so they could share a cable modem. I looked at a lot of 10Base-T hubs, and found this one to be among the least expensive with the best satisfaction ratings. I am especially impressed with the hub's small size and metal case -- other hubs are larger and have plastic cases.To me, the best recommendation for a piece of network hardware is that you never have to think about it, it just works. This hub gives me that in spades.",5
"Our office used to use a handful of the EN-104 4-port hubs and some of the EN-108 (the 8-port version of the same product).As 10 Mbps hubs go, the EN-104's are really nice.The quality of NetGear equipment has always impressed me:-  Nice sturdy metal construction instead of plastic.-  Status indicators built into the jacks, so you can easily tell which cable is connected and is active.-  Right-angled barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally.-  With an easy-to-access switch, Port 1 toggles between station mode and uplink mode.  Unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together, this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink.-  Screw-mount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall, underside of a counter, etc.If you want to set up a network without spending much, these hubs work well.  However, I suggest you buy a 10/100 Mbps hub instead.Here's why:Practically all new networkable devices today support 100 Mbps (FastEthernet) as well as 10 Mbps (Ethernet).  The EN-104 hub (and other 10 Mbps hubs) will limit you to the slower speed.As 10/100 Mbps hubs are readily available today, and are quite affordable, I think your money is better spent on the faster hub.Is there a noticeable difference between 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps?  It depends on your usage, but if you regularly work with files larger than about 300 KBytes or larger, you'll notice a tangible difference.  For truly large files (like graphics/movies, or when installing an application via a network drive), a 10 second transfer at 100 Mbps will take well over a minute at 10 Mbps.If the NetGear 10/100 hub (DS-104) is a bit too pricey for you, you might consider the Linksys EFAH05W 10/100 hub.  Though not as &quot;nice&quot; as NetGear equipment, the Linksys 10/100 hub is only a few dollars more than this NetGear 10 Mbps hub.",4
"My cable modem makes for great, fast internet access... for one computer. But what about downloading updates for my iBook without disconnecting my iMac? This hub has done that with ease. Easy to follow instructions had my home network up and running within ten minutes. Never a problem since.",5
"For just a simple 10 Mbps hub, this is an excellent one for the price. It is compact and sturdy, especially with the metal casing. Link and status lights are handy along with the Normal/Uplink switch. No software installation needed - plug the power in and the CAT cables and you're all set!",5
"A great hub that allows you to share an uplink onto another network with 3 computers or have a local network of 4 computers.  Either way, the hub has been very reliable and performance has been as promised.  Netgear is known for making quality Ethernet products and this is just another one of them.",4
I have bought two of these for home and office use.  They work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality.  I was running at least Windows 98 on all computers I hooked up to the ethernet hub.  Windows makes it easy to set up file and printer sharing.After you are hooked up to a network you will not need to swap disks all the time in order to exchange information or to move files for printing.  You can transfer a hundred megabytes in a minute or two depending on the kinds of files.Setup is a breeze if you have ethernet cards installed already.  Even if you do not have cards installed already there are instructions to walk you through step by step.,4
This sturdy case has outlasted many cameras and I find it adequate for carrying my camera around.,4
"I have the Kodak DC 3400 camera - and this carry case is perfect for it.  This case is compact - but yet large enough to take everything along that I need:  extra batteries, PC cables, the camera's manual and CD disk, and a Kodak AA battery charger.It works so well with the DC 3400, it's almost as if it was made for it.  Good case for the money.To see if this case is right for you, compare your digital camera's dimensions to Kodak's DC 3400.  If the cameras are similar in size, you're all set.",5
"This case is the perfect size for the D-460 and accessories (case is approx 7&quot; tall X 3.5&quot; wide X 3&quot; deep). The main pouch is well padded and made of soft material. The bottom is reinforced to resist wear. Inside the front zippered pocket, there is a mesh pocket for memory cards, as well as an divided elastic band meant for 4 AA batteries. Inside the flap of the front pocket there is a zippered mesh pouch, which runs the entire legnth of the flap (approx. 6&quot;x3&quot;), for extra accessories.The only thing I dislike is the velcro on the main flap is a bit weak, and seems to come open without much force. I would have rather seen a zipper to keep the main pouch closed.Other than that, this is a fantastic case, and I recommend it.",4
"I bought this for a Kodak DC280, and it was OK to use.  I guess that I realized Ithat I wanted a larger style bag, though this one worked if I just wanted to bring along the camera and an extra memory card.  I was never thrilled with it, and then I purchased a new camera (canon G1) that did not fit in this case.  That was when I realized how good life could be with a larger bag.If you want a small case to just carry your camera and a few very small accessories (4 AA batteris and a memory card or two), then this might be the one for you.  But it wasn't the right one for me.",3
"This is the best camera bag I have purchased, especially since it has the quality of any other Case Logic product, superb!I own an old Toshiba PDRM1 digital camera, and in this neat little bag, there is a protected pouch for the camera, two storage areas for digital media, and a storage for 4-AA (or AAA) batteries.I think this bag is super convenient, since I can carry my extra SmartMedia cards and spare 4-AA batteries.  The size of the bag is small enough to fit in my travel bag, but yet, has a lot of storage space for all the necessities of a digital camera.I highly recommend for a small digital camera like my Toshiba PDRM1.  Dimensions of my camera: 4-3/4&quot; long by 3-1/4&quot; high by 1-1/2&quot; deep.  This camera is a perfect fit for this particular bag.",5
"I bought this bag to use with my Olympus C-4000.  Based on what other reviewers wrote, I expected the bag the bag to be more compact than it is (I could fit two of my cameras in there).  Construction and compartments are excellent, and it's a great bag if you have a few accessories to carry.",4
"Alright, it's just a bag, but it's a great bag for the Olympus 3000.  It has room for everything I need for the camera.  The camera itself, battery charger, an extra set of batteries, a couple of extra media cards, the accessory cords for downloading.  All this fits into the bag very securely, without everything banging into each other, because of the pocket dividers.The bag is not too bulky, rather compact with padding.  The zippers function very well.  The pockets designed such that I don't have to worry about things falling out.  Overall, a very good bag to take along with the camera and recharging supplies.",5
"Received this bag to go along with my Olympus C-4000.  It's quite a nice bag, relatively compact and easily fits my C-4000 with plenty of protection offereed by the walls of the case and padded divider.  There is plenty of room left for cables, a flash or even another camera if you've got one.  A mesh pouch on the inside of the main compartment flap offers a handy place to store my SM cards.  On the other side, another component offers 4 elastic loops for batteries,  and 2 mesh pouches (1 zippered) for storing more batteries or whatever else you might have.  I can easily store 3 sets of 4 AA batteries in here, with plenty of room for more SM cards.  And to top it all off, a zippered side pouch for another place to put stuff (nothing too thick though).  There's an adjustable carry strap that you can use to sling over your shoulder, plus handles on the top and side, so there are plenty of ways to grab onto the bag.  The only think I don't like about this bag is that mine doesn't seem to want to stand up.  It always ends up rolling over onto its back.  This however is a pretty minor thing.",4
"ANd its rain resistant (got stuck in the rain at practice a few times), padded for drop protection and fits a boatload of stuff.  Got my gamboy on one side and my digicam on the other.  AA Batteries in the secret compartment, and money and stuff on the outside.",5
"I own the Kodak DC3400 digital camera, and can't say enough about this case.  It has room for my battery charger, extra set of batteries, all PC cables, Kodak's software CD, and the manual that came with my camera.If your digital camera is similar in size to Kodak's DC3400, get this bag.  It's simply the best balance, between compact size - and having enough room for all your accessories.",5
"The Case Logic DC70 Digital Camera and Accessory Bag is great for Olympus C-3000, C-3040, C-3030 and the HP c315 xi and  a couple of other HP and Olympus models. However it is not big enough to room the Sony Mavicas. So dont bother getting this for those.I do have a problem with this bag and that is that it seems like the accessories on there are really stuffed onces your camera is placed inside it. Because the camera comes with the USB Cable and the tv connection cable and it's hard to  pack all of them in here with the camera without stuffing them in.....There's place for a battery recharger in there and a set of batteries along with the Compact flash cards. Overall this case is pretty decent although you've got to be careful not to let the case swing about from your arm and hit a wall or something. There are other websites selling this a little cheaper.",4
I ordered two and they came in the standard distribution box that stood up to thefreight carrier.Inside the carton was the two seperate retail sales boxes in premium shape.Units worked right out of the box once batteries were connected.Powerchute CD was original older version and the web had the updated 3.0 (2012).Stable angled plug with a very sturdy cord.,5
"I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS!",2
"Had mine since December 1999 but noticed that the battery failed after about 3 years, like the other poster wrote, APC didn't list a replacement at first but now they do and I finally got around to replacing it.  Battery type is RBC2 for those wondering.Solid unit, having a telephone line/out and USB controller is a plus.",4
"I have owned one of these UPS's for about 3 years.  Earlier this year the alarms went off indicating that the battery needed replacement.  I thought that was odd considering the age of the unit.  No problem though,  I'll just log onto APC's website and order a replacement battery.  Wasn't I surprised to see that APC indicates that this model doesn't have a replacable battery.  This didn't make much sense to me since the unit has an access door to the battery compartment.Well,  I removed the battery and found a web vendor that had a replacement for $18.  It is a very common 12volt cell and was available from several vendors.  The unit is back up and working well again.I have experienced several black-outs in the past few years and this UPS can keep my CPU, 19"" monitor, cable modem & network switch operable for enough time to save any work in progress and shut down my system.In closing, it is a well designed unit with adequate power for most home or small office systems.  But I was a little put off by the short life of the original battery and incorrect replacement information listed by APC.",3
"I have had three of these units for the past 5-6 years (one for my PC, one for the wife's and one for the Tivo & cable box).  We have relatively unreliable power here with it going off an average of once a month -- usually for seconds at a time but occasionally for hours.  Anyway these units have kept our stuff safe and running.  However they don't last too long on battery power.  Just long enough for short power outages or long enough to shut things down.The batteries wore out after about 2-3 years so I replaced them using batteries from a web vendor.  Now the first battery of this second round has failed so I'm buying another round of three batteries.Hopefully these units will last many more years.",4
"This sound card doesn't reproduce MP3 or WAV files any differently than a more expensive card would.  Creative Labs has always made great cards and drivers.  The only thing this card doesn't give you that the more expensive card do is the 3d sound effects when playing video games, and true Dolby 5.1 for DVD playback.  However, I doubt many people are setup for this situation, and many people do not watch DVD's or play games.  If this is you, this card is perfect for you.  If you are a gamer then this card will work perfectly fine.  I personally find the 3d effects annoying, and prefer to play on a card like this.  I highly recomend this card.",5
"I keep a lot of computer equipment at home, due to the fact that I am an A+ technician working to complete my MCSE (microsoft certified systems engineer) credentials.  I bought a pre-owned computer from ebay last month in order to practice setting up computer networks at home.  This particular computer is a business-class desktop, designed more for the office environment rather than the typical entertainment PC that we would normally have at home.  I decided to add DVD capability to this system, in order to enjoy a movie at my work desk whenever the mood strikes me to take a break from work (which happens quite frequently).  I added a Sony DVD player, this particular Soundblaster soundcard, and a pair of Cambridge Soundworks speakers.  Within thirty minutes, I was watching The Lord of Rings.Now, about the Soundblaster.  This is a very good Soundcard for its intended purpose.  Which is to provide basic sound functionality to a desktop computer.  The sound quality is good enough to enjoy listening to stereo sounds from music CDs and DVDs.  But please, do not expect this card to provide you with theatre-like surround sound quality.  This is definitely the wrong price range if you need that kind of quality.I compared the sound quality of this office system to my primary home system.  My home system is a Dell Dimension 8200, with a Turtle Beach Soundcard and the Altec Lansing surround system.  I switched the mode of operation of the Altec Lansings from surround to stereo for comparison purposes between the two systems.  Subjectively, you can definitely tell the difference between the two.I can recommend this Soundblaster to anyone who is simply looking to add stereo sound to his or her desktop computer.  It is inexpensive and easy to install.  It will require the use of one of your PCI slots.  For your information, I installed this card on an IBM 300PL desktop PC.  The system has a Pentium III processor and 128 MB of RAM.  It is running an evaluation copy of Windows 2000 Advanced Server.  The DVD player is a Sony DDU1621 and the Monitor is a KDS 17 inch flat screen CRT.  If you are interested, I wrote reviews on the KDS monitor and the Sony DVD player, here at Amazon.",5
"I have owned other sound blaster sound cards. I have found Creative Labs to be the best in the sound card industry. This sound card is to replace and older model.So for, the Sound blaster card is functioning well. I always consider Creative Labs sound cards for all of my sound needs.",5
"I installed per instructions, beign always grounded with a wrist strap wired to live ground circuit.  When I turned on the computer it went crazy and burned out the motherboard.  Took it to local tech who said newly installed board was bad and caused the motherboard to short out.  Ruined computer!!!",1
"This is a basic sound card.  Nothing fancy.  The thing that seperates it from the rest is that Creative is a huge company and has drivers available for all Windows (the Linux/BSD world probably supports this thing, I haven't checked).  This is as close to plug and play as you can get.That guy who ranted about this card crashing his system needs to buy a clue and check his IRQs, not to mention dump Windows ME (which *Microsoft* doesn't even stand by).",4
"Essentially, this is the entry-level, 16-bit audio Creative Labs sound  card. It has a built-in mock '3D' stereo effect, a 128-voice MIDI  wavetable, and it can sample at up to 48khz in 16-bit stereo, and that's  about all there is to it. Whilst it doesn't do anything wrong in itself  (it's plug-and-play, so if you're using Windows it should work out of the  box), the Soundblaster Live isn't much more expensive, and offers  environmental audio.If you only dabble with music and don't play many  new games it's a perfectly adequate solution, however.",3
"This is a basic low-end sound card. It puts out pretty good sound for most things you do on your computer. It comes with some ok software and all the cables to connect to your cd-rom drive so you can rip your cds directly from the cd-rom. The drivers are included for all windows including xp.Why you wouldn't want this cardIf you are a gamer or listen to high quality mp3 (over 128 bitrate), 128 or less will sound fine with this cardI don't understand people having driver support because creative labs is the biggest sound card company on the market and one thing you will not have to worry about is driver support with any current or future versions of windows",3
"These binoculars are super nice.  They really get you close to the action, and the 3-D effect is terrific.  Detail and sharpness are very good as well.If you wear glasses, you're better off removing them.  If you leave your glasses on it just doesn't work very well.  On the other hand, you are allowed to adjust each  eyepiece separate if you're like me and don't see 20/20.  However, there is a trick to it because you can only adjust individual focus on the right eyepiece.  So you cover the right eyepiece and focus the binoculars, then cover the left side to fine-tune the focus for your right eye. I found it a bit counter-intuitive, and think it would be better if you could separately adjust the focus on each side.  Even so, once you have it dialed in, there are marks on the frame and the eyepiece that you can use as reference for when it gets borrowed or changed inadvertently.My biggest issue with these binoculars is that they won't focus in close enough.  The target has to be close to 100' away.  Since they're high-powered binoculars, that's probably ok for most uses.  But I spend a lot of time watching birds 20' from my window.  Now I'm going to have to buy another pair for that purpose.They're also heavy.  Expect to put them down often to rest.  That's probably normal for binoculars this powerful.  When my wife first used them, she was shocked at how large far-away objects were.",3
"i was actually pretty excited to get these, but when it arrived, it was defective. the monoculars didn't align, causing me to see double and 2 picture, not as one. also, there seemed to be a scratch of some sort on the right monocular. i tried to clean or blow it out to see if it was just an eye lash, but it never went away. i sent them back for a return.",1
"I was really looking forward to getting these binoculars. I had owned Bushnell binoculars in the past and was very happy with them.These arrived totally broken.The left main lens housing was sheared completely off from the unit.Looking at them, I found they were constructed using cheap plastic for the main body. The lens housings are screwed into the body, but the plastic is so fragile that apparently when they were dropped sometime during the shipping process the plastic shattered.I probably could have Super-glued the housing back on but then they would have been subject to fogging since when the housing broke off the Nitrogen that is injected into the housing escaped. Nitrogen is used to prevent the lenses from fogging.While checking out the remainder of the unit, I worked with the quick focus lever and found that it didn't hold focus very well either. I would like to see a unit that has a dial focus with a lever fine focus so that the major focus point is stable. The lever focus would be really nice for finer focusing after you have zeroed in on the subject. I would have used them for viewing auto racing for the most part, so once you get the major focus point clear, a lever focus for fine focusing would be great for viewing a moving target like race cars that can vary in distance by up to 1/4 of a mile closer or further than the main focus point as the cars travel around the track. That is where the quick focus lever could do a great job. But to use it for the entire focus field is too much and it isn't fine enough since a tiny bump in the wrong direction can cause you to lose sight of your target object entirely.I also agree that the design of the focus bar is poor in that you have to use both hands to focus since you can only push down. Either that or if you have a long finger you can reach across the center and push down on the other side of the bar as well.I won't be reordering a replacement. Instead I will look for binoculars that have a more durable housing since using binoculars subjects them to being ""knocked around"" and if the material used by Bushnell shatters so easily, they are not going to last very long.So my advice to anyone who owns these particular binoculars is to protect them from being dropped or even bumped into trees, etc very hard since the housing is brittle and will shatter. If you use them in Winter, they will be even more brittle and the housing will shatter even more easily than in warm weather like we have now.I would also advise Bushnell to change their packaging since if they make a product that is this fragile they should pack it in thicker shock absorbing materials than they currently do since what they use wouldn't protect a product a fraction of the weight and bulk of this product. That would lessen the chance of catastrophic damage such as these were obviously subjected to.My cell phone, which weighs 3.5 ounces came in a corrugated box with a total weight of one pound with 10 ounces of that being the box and packing materials (the charger weighs about 2 oz).Yet these binoculars that weigh 12 TIMES as much as my cell phone, with optics that are far more vulnerable to damage from the shocks of shipping and handling than a cell phone have only a couple of ounces of material to protect them from damage and came in a box no sturdier than a cereal box. It is a miracle if any of these binoculars get to the customer in one piece!",1
"This is a good binoculars. It is clear and light. Buy it only if you really need 16x magnification. At times, you will wish you didn't have so much of magnification. My next binoculars will be one with zoom !The carrying case is cheap-looking (so is the neck strap).",5
"Bought this in 2004 and it going great. 16x50 is on the higher end and I would recommend a smaller one because slight shake in the hand makes the objet move a lot, otherwise eit is good.",5
"Love the binoculars just like everyone else.  Only complaint is the flimsy attachments.  The neck strap is impossible to attach and is obviously a piece of junk anyway so don't bother.  I find it annoying that the lens covers aren't connected in some way.  They pop off very easily.  Just seems to me like something that could easily be prevented with better design.  All things considered, these are really minor complaints.  The purpose is to get great binoculars for a great price, and that I did.  I would still highly recommend them.",4
"They aren't wide-angle as advertised. They don't fold together enough to get a single vision through both lenses, so one always sees double. I had several friends try them and they all said the same thing, so it isn't just me. With a name brand like Bushnell I thought I couldn't go wrong, but apparently their quality control is non-existent. I ordered these while traveling out west and couldn't send them back until I got home. I tried to return them, but Amazon said the last return date was one day before, so I am stuck with these useless binoculars. I need to find someone whose eyes are really far apart and give them to them.",1
"I purchased these with the intent of using for bird watching but they literally make me feel dizzy and green. No matter what I try, they just don't seem to provide a clear, distinct view. Seem abnormally darker than others I've used and never give a crisp clear view. On the other hand, they are by far more ergonomic than the old ones I owned, feel great, solid, nice set...but wish I'd kept my 30 year old set instead. Not good for bird watching. Can't begin to imagine for sports. Perhaps its my eyes? Unsure but they don't compare to 30 year old set.",2
"When you're getting a pair of 16x50 binoculars at this price-point, it would probably be harsh of me to criticize them too hard, so long as I can see through them effectively :-)They're heavy - but that's what I expected, so no complaints there.The strap that comes with these is made of nasty thick plastic - a kind of strap that I haven't seen since I got a cheap SLR in the early 1980s. Completely pointless (unusable in my opinion), and the first thing I would advise is to go buy the strap/support system of your choice and don't relay on the nasty accessory that comes with.The binoculars come with lens caps on. I haven't figure out if they intend you to use them all the time to protect the lenses, or if they're just for show in the box. The large caps are fine, but the small ones do not stay attached, so don't rely on them to protect.In use, the quick focus mechanism is actually very effective but definitely requires two hands to operate as it's a little stiff (and as a lever, you have to be able to press down on either side). I guess few people would be operating something this heavy with one hand, but it does mean that both hands are under tension as you have to have fingers on the  focus mechanism.Optically, these are absolutely built to the price. Definite chromatic aberration here giving a nice blue/yellow fringe, especially at longer distances. But for the price, I kind of expected that. Diopter correction works well.Overall, a great product for the price. I would possibly recommend looking at spending a little more to get some better optics, but really for this money it's a great way to get this much magnification.",4
Binoculars are very powerful...the focus is simple and accurate.  Very pleased with the binocs and the price was terrific.,5
They work and for the price I cant complain to much. The construction of the unit is almost all plastic and the ocular bridge flexes when you put any pressure on it. Though its nice to have a set of Bino's that don't break the bank if one of the young ones drops/damages/loses them. At 16x they can be little shaky off hand but I use this set primarily for spotting during rim fire shooting games and these binoculars make seeing .22lr bullet holes at 50yds very easy to see and score.,3
"got these so I could use them for hunting and other spotting, little bulky, but good distance.  Comes with everything you need.",4
"The actual dimnetions of this product are 7"" long and 7"" wide ( at the end of the product- the part that we hold to our eyes is not quite as wide and fit to the eyes.These are VERY strong binoculars, they are 16x the magnification, the 50 ( the other #) is simply the size of the front lens.. its 50 mm in diameter ( wide)... they are very strong and you can see things very far away. If you need a pair for a concert or a football game or something, then I believe these would be way to powerful and large. ( also I read somewhere, and I think its true that anything over 10x the magnification ( these are 16x) that you should use a tripod, since its too hard to see properly, since it needs to be completely still.",5
"good product for the price i buyed for a gift , the owner says to love it.",5
I purchased this binocs for a tiger safari in India and am amazed by the quality of this product. Certainly recommended and a great value for price. AAAAAAA plus quality.,5
"I bought this item to go nature viewing and must say that it really is a great binocular for the price.  The items viewed have a really nice 3-dimensional look to them and the diopter comes in handy even for someone with very bad vision like myself.  The focus for this model (16 x 50 Wide Angle) is a flat tab between the barrels that makes it VERY convenient to use without having to look or stretch your fingers.  It gives a very nice field of vision and has roll down eye cups, which is good just in case you want to wear your glasses or shades.  The binoculars do shake a little b/c of the power of the magnification.  And it can be a chore to hold for long periods of time b/c of its weight.  It weighs about as much as one of Michener's hardback novels.Here is where it can get interesting.  The binoculars come with a pleather carrying case, a really cheap neck strap that looks like a plastic shoelace, and a cheap cleaning cloth that is way too abrasive to be used everyday.  I suggest replacing both the neck strap and cleaning cloth as soon as you can.  The soft, microfiber cloths they sell in eyeglass stores works great.  Plus, pick up some of the eyeglass cleaner (spray directly onto cloth, not lens) as it really gets the lens clean and protects any coating on the glass.Tripod use:  highly recommended to get a steady picture.  You can get a regular camera tripod for around 18 dollars.  Yes, this binocular comes with a tripod adapter.  No, it's not very easy to find. &lt;g&gt;  The instruction booklet is virtually useless, but I found out through the website that the adaptor is located behind the front cap between the barrels.  Just screw the cap off and viola, there is your threaded coupler.  You will still need to get a binocular adaptor to connect the binoculars to the tripod, but I've found that they aren't too expensive:  around 7-16 dollars for the generic models. I gave this item 4 stars b/c of the poorly written instruction manual and cheap accessories.  Hope some of this info helps.  Can't wait to see the stars tonight!",4
"I gave it only 3 stars because the focus is just a marketing gimmick that creates a cheap focusing mechanism.  A decent traditional wheel for focusing is superior.  You can't easily get a good focus, pressing your eyes against the eyepiece can force them out of focus, and it's easy to bump the rocker bar.  At 16x power, you have to carefully adjust focus and a rocker bar is an awful design.  You have to use both hands to focus: you can press down on one side of the rocker bar, but not up, so to go in and out of focus to get good sharpness, you have to press down with one hand's finger and then press down with the other hand's finger.  The rocker bar is terrible idea, especially for 16x!  To make matter's worse, there is a fair amount of play in the rocker bar.  The rocker bar seems to be the limiting factor on short distances. 40 feet seemed to be the shortest distance they would focus.  Stars come into focus well before the limit of the long-distance focus is reached, possibly indicating questionable workmanship, or maybe it makes it better for those who are really-bad near-sighted.The moons of jupiter were clear and sharp even under city lights.  Since it was the brightest ""star"" in the sky I thuoght i was looking at venus, but when i saw the 3 sharp dots surrounding the round disk, i knew it had to be jupiter.  You have to rest them on a chair to see the moons.The price here at Amazon (with free shipping) is $20 less than my local Walmart after our 10% taxes.16x requires a fence or car or window to provide the stability needed to make full use of 16x. Even without a prop, it's good, but if your not going to use a prop, 12x50 is better because the amount of light is greater and the field of view is larger.",3
"These are decent binoculars.  They are rubber armored and seem fairly sturdy.  I live on the 9th floor near the beach.  These are great for watching moving boats and jetskis go by through my living room window.  They are good for a quick look at something, but difficult to hold steady for more than 30 seconds.  I guess that's the same for all 16x binoculars.  They work better with a tripod mount and a tripod.  These are probably easier to hold steady than 20x50's.  The Zip focus is handy.  The focus at 16x magnification is more critical than 8x or 10x binoculars.  I find myself re-focusing very frequently.  Kind of a pain after using my other Bushnell 8x25 Permafocus binoculars, which NEVER need to be refocused.  I got these for stargazing.  They don't work as well as expected for that purpose.  First, the BAK7 prisms don't transmit light as well as BAK4 prisms.  Second, the 50mm objective lens is not large enough for 16x magnification at night.  I also own a pair of Pentax Whitetails 10x50's which are much better for stargazing.  The Whitetails are much easier to hold steady and the image is much brighter at night.  The Whitetails are slightly heavier though.  The Celestron 15x70's are probably a better choice for stargazing if you want high magnification.  I thought about returning the Bushnell 16x50's because they aren't so good at night.  I gave them a second chance today and decided to keep them for daytime use.  Not bad as a spare pair to have around with higher magnification than 8x or 10x, but I don't recommend them as your first or only pair of binoculars though.As for magnification, 7x and 8x binos are fairly easy to hold steady.  10x approaches the limit of steadyness for handheld use.  I used to have a pair of Tasco 12x50's and tried to use them for stargazing.  I had to prop my elbows on a car hood to use them.  Even then, they were not very steady.  I loaned them to a friend for a football game once, and I never saw them again.  No great loss really.  16x is really pushing the limit for shakeyness.  There's no way I'd buy 20x binoculars for handheld use.  8x seems to be the best compromise between steadyness and magnification.  For stargazing, many authors recommend 7x50 binoculars.  Personally, I don't think 7x magnification is good enough.  You'll want something with higher magnification after trying them.  You can't really go wrong with a pair of 10x50's for stargazing, like the 'Pentax' Whitetails I mentioned before.  The 10x50's might even be cheaper for the same optical quality as 7x50's.  A pair of 8x56's or 9x63's would be good for stargazing too, but the 10x50's are more bang for the buck.  If you've never owned a pair of binoculars before, and you want some good ones for daytime use, you can't really go wrong with a good pair of 8x40's.  I like the 8x40's better than 7x35's, because 7x is not high enough magnification.  The price difference between 7x35 and 8x40 isn't that much.",3
"I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with ""high power"" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN ""NIKON EAGLE VIEW"" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!!!",1
"The pair of 16x50 Bushnell Powerview binoculars I received were defective from the start, with serious double vision and unequal focus between eyes (despite diopter adjustment), so I can't comment on their optic quality.  I did test each barrel separately and thought the 16x50 view was big, bright and clear. . .Although it seemed neither side focused real shapely, that may have been from the defect(s) my pair came with.Currently (3/2014) the listing for these 16x50 Porro-Prism binoculars says Roof Prism for some reason ??I tested my 16x50's on a sunny day.  Tho they're high power (16) for the objective lens diameter (50), the exit pupil size gave me no trouble. . .It may have been in double vision but it was easy to get the full view, at least on a bright day.There are complaints in the reviews about the Lever focus mechanism, versus a focus wheel.  The little that I used the binoculars, I didn't have a problem with the lever focus.  In fact, focusing by rocking the lever with a finger on each side was kind of nice.  The lever mechanism seems like a promising idea but apparently whether Bushnell executed it effectively is in question.  And I suppose it's possible the lever mechanism had something to do with the unequal focus between barrels and apparent soft-focus but given my pair's other huge problems, it was impossible to tell.The reviews complaining of the too-wide interpupillary adjustment are SPOT-ON.  I'm male of average height.  My eyes aren't particularly close together but my binoculars at their narrowest interpupillary distance were barely narrow enough for me.  I've never before had that trouble with binoculars.  These binoculars would be useless for lots and lots of people.Otherwise the binoculars seemed solid and durable.My main problem wasn't with the binoculars but with Amazon Warehouse Deals, where I bought them.  There's no reason binoculars this defective should have been relisted and sold to me...It's plain bad business and bad customer service. Anyone considering buying binoculars from Warehouse Deals should do it with eyes wide open for lemons.  Luckily they're pretty easy about returns and letting you try again. A keeper arrives eventually.Of course I'll return them.  I'm ambivalent about trying another pair of 16x50 Powerviews.  The complaints about the focus lever and interpupillary adjustment had me on the fence to begin with.  Then I get this pair that's so miserably out-of-whack. . .It might be a fluke or it might be the Powerview design ??If you're looking at Powerviews, consider Bushnell H2O; I have a pair of 8x42 H2O's.  For about the same price the H2O's are waterproof & more solid and come with a wheel focus and better twist-up, rather than fold-up, eyecups.  However, H2O's don't have the attractive selection of high powers and big objectives.",3
"I do not know if my experience was the same for those that had an awfull time installing this modem. But after force install I was online all in all about 20-30 minutes, sure that should not be the case especially now days coming from a well known brand such as this (was), install should have been 2-3 minutes.First out of the box, the install disk failed, error something about corrupt or missing driver... that seemd ok the instructions warned of a possible system patched needed, ok so did the patch, same error. Missing or corrupt file... hmmm I wonder how many bad install disks are floating arouund aggrevating people.This is really a great stable fast modem, feel bad for those that gave up on the install. Anyways, first I had to figure out what driver on the disk belongs with my modem, after a few trial and error and educated guess I identifieds the installation driver directly on the disk and manually loaded the drivers.But thats not the end of this story. For some reason the PCI card barely fit into the case, the aligment was off and could barely fit. I did manage to get everything seated but it was difficult, the plate needs to come in a 8th of and inch, perhaps even a quarter.My install was in a Dell Dimension tower, Win98se, the old USrobotics finnaly caved in after years of slowly dying.Modem connect fast and realatively seems to work pretty fast as far as browsing web pages, almost comparable to low speed DSL, really seems that good. Connection consistantly made at 45k, which is very exceptable, the old USR when new pegged 52k alot, and I was impressed, but eventually that card died after 5 years... I have an old MOT 56k about 8 years and still runs very well.3 Stars, aggrevating installation, bad disk etc., and bad manufacturing, the alignment was difficult to seat properly, very tight fit. After those hurdles, runs very well.NO MATTER WHAT MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEM THAT IS HARWARE BASED NOT SOFTWARE DRIVEN!!! THERE ARE TWO VERSION OF THE DIAMOND SupraMax MODEM MAKE SURE IT IS THE CORRECT ONE!!! Look for the PRO model, it has the on board ""DSP"" chip... hardware based.If having difficulty install the SupraMax PRO version, look for the ""PCIPROA"" on the disk. Otherwise for the NON-PRO version use the multiple install disk folders that are next to the ""...PROA"".",3
"I purchased this modem for my folks PC and it works great.  They're running Win98SE on an 800Mhtz Athlon with 160 MB RAM.  This brings me to a point I think is important.  Some reviewers (running Win2K or WinXP) left negative reviews for this item because it didn't work with their computers.  My advice is to know your computer before you buy ANY hardware for it.  You should know what operating system you're running (and its version) and your hardware configuration (at least your CPU speed, RAM and hard drive space).  If you're using Windows, right-clicking on ""My Computer"" and selecting ""Properties"" will give you most of the info you need.  So will ""System Information"" in the ""System Tools"" folder.  It's a simple rule and will save you a great deal of time and trouble in the long run.",5
THE MODEM INSTALLED AND WAS CONFIGURED IN ABOUT 3 MINUTES FROM START TO FINISH. TIGER.DIRECT IS A GOOD SUPPLIER.,5
The best Modem I've seen so far. Way better the USRobotics/3Com Modems. I have two and they work very nicely. It's the next modem I'de buy if I needed another one.,5
"This modem is the most economical one that I have ever purchased. Under Windows 98, it ran at 48K. But in my case I had to enable the PCI slot through the BIOS. My PCI slots were disabled by default by the Phoenix  BIOS. I have a Dec XL-590. I tried to install it under Windows NT4.0 (SP6)  but to no avail. Even though service was excellent, the modem exhibited no  response after installation. I was advised to reinstall NT4.0 and the  Service Pack, but my system crashed. With a US Robotics internal faxmodem,  I got 51K in Windows 98. The difference is not significant, but the price  was. In general, I highly recommend this economical and fast modem under  Windows 98.",4
"I picked up my modem and installed it in just a couple of minutes. It was easy. When I log on, it seems to connect at 49333 every time. I guess that is good because my 33.6 connected at 31.9. I was going to buy that $25 one with the $20. rebate but from the reviews - you get what you pay for. I  went with Diamond and I am glad I did. The box says the requirements are  for a pentium 133 or higher. I have a Pentium 120 and it has worked great.",5
"Like other people have said before me, this modem won't break through the 50Kbs barrier. My external xircom [serial port] modem could connect at 53 kbs on the same line. (The effective difference between 49 kbs and 53 kbs  is negligible though, so who cares)The drivers for this modem loaded  easily the first time, and when I clean-installed win2000, they  automatially re-installed, no questions asked.On a side note: This modem  supports the rare 3.3 volt standard. (Some high-end workstations and  servers use the 3.3 volt standard, but everyone else uses the 5 volt  standard- so this doesn't matter for most people.  3 volts is an  &quot;emerging&quot; standard which will probably never catch on). Most pci  modems only fit into 5 volt PCI slots. A 3.3 volt pci card slot has  different gooves so that you can't mistakenly put a 5 volt card into it.  The supramax is compatable with both. (Silicon Graphics pointed me towards  the supramax after I struck out with another modem).Closing comments:  This modem has served me well, but now it collects dust inside my computer,  thanks to my cable modem.  It's still nice to know that it's there for me,  and I use it occasionally to test how long my sites take to load for the  [not-yet-broadbanded] people",4
"This RIO model is a nifty music device.  Compact size, fantastic sound quality, no skipping, and easy transfer of music from a computer.  On the other hand, it only holds six or seven songs, the door on the battery case  doesn't stay shut so well after a few months of use, and a little abuse,  and the &quot;hold&quot; switch gets sticky after a while and becomes  difficult to move.  If you can find it on the cheap it's a cool toy,  otherwise wait for a newer model or get some other technology to fire up  your tunes.",3
"The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!",5
"I own a 300SE and aside from the fact that it has updated firmware and more memory it is exactly the same.  I was worried about things that I had read stating that the case was shoddy, the volume level was insufficient  and the memory didn't hold enough.  I just wanted to say that all of this  IS NOT true.  It seems really solid to me, not that I'd ever drop the thing  or be rough with it, but it does just fine while jogging or riding a  bike...as for the volume level comments perhaps people are just listening  to songs encoded at a low base level because I listen to mine on level 5 of  20 and it's fine for most songs unless I'm in a REALLY noisy  environment...lastly I listen to all of my songs at 128k. and I can fit an  acceptable amount of music on my 64megs--no it isn't as much as a CD but  with 2 32meg smartmedia cards on the way that should be more than enough to  get me through all but the longest of plane flights.  With the portability  of the transfer cable and software I can just burn all of my mp3s to a Cd  or 2, throw it in my luggage and change the songs out from wherever I  happen to be...much more efficient than lugging around all of my CDR mixes  and other CDs.  True the parallel transfer is much slower than the USB that  the 500 offers, but do I really want to use USB when places that I travel  might not offer USB support?  Also the backlight of the new 500s are  supposed to drain the battery power and I don't find the lack of a  backlight to be as big of a problem as I thought it would be, however.  I  would definately recommend purchasing the rio remote as it super easy to  use and extends the headphone's cord length by a good 2 feet.  See ya!",4
"I got my Rio PMP 300 from my employer as a gift.  It was my first exposure to MP3, as up to that point I had been dismissing it as a fad.  Having the device, and about 150 CD's, I figured why not give it a shot.The installation of the software went smooth.  I found an update, and installed that as well with no problems.  Then I started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable.  I was running on Windows NT, which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer, but with some caveats.  I would start ripping and the software would crash.  I would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash.  I would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didn't actually make it.  Bottom line - the connectivity for this device was pathetic.But speaking for the device itself - I loved it.  The music played cleanly, without interruption, regardless of how much I shook the device.  The buttons on the front are well placed, well labeled, and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access, but you don't have to worry about them protruding.  It has all the features you might want including random and repeat.  The display let's me know how much memory I have, what track number is playing, and the time of the song.  There are also various other indicators that are helpfull (battery, etc.).The memory on this device is small - 32Mb.  And the manufacturer says it will only support up to 64Mb total with an expansion card.  That expansion card can hold it's own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory.  However, vendor chose the odd memory type of 3.3V for the external memory versus typical CompactFlash.There's a convenient &quot;lock&quot; switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering.  This can be good in two ways: it won't get turned on accidentally and burn battery, and you won't accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening.  The belt clip is handy, and detachable, and the battery life (one AA) is quite respectable.In all, I really love my Rio PMP 300.  It's perfect for a trip to the gym, a jog around the neighborhood, or even for a short plane flight.  If all you need is an hour (30 mins on internal memory alone at a 128 sample rate) to pass the time, then you really don't need to spend more - this is the perfect device.",4
"Unlike many of the other Minidisc owners on here, I happen to like MP3. The minidisks are great....but for something small and light to tuck in my pocket, nothing beats the Rio! It's at least half the size and a third the  weight of my minidisk player. And yes, the size DOES make a difference to  many people.I love getting free MP3's off the web, and while I *could*  put them on minidisks, I like being able to every day or so put a  completely different assortment of songs on the Rio to listen to. It's  certainly not much harder than recording a disk and I'm one of those people  that can listen to favorite songs over and over so a little repetition  doesn't bother ME any.Unfortunately, the Rio is not without faults. In  fact, I have a hard time recommending it. 32 meg is definitely NOT enough.  I got a Flash card, and have started having varying problems, first with my  memory being unusable, and then having small chunks become corrupted. Am  now having problems with the player intermittently stopping on its own and  freezing up so I have to remove the battery. Oh, should mention that the  first Rio I got had a broken battery compartment and was returned. Am still  waiting on my rebates. HATE not being able to use it on Windows NT, and not  having USB. And the headsets that come with it are worthless for many  people. Personally, I'm not sure I even want to try the later Rio models,  as I've had so much trouble with this one in only a few months of owning  it.",2
"for the price this is really cool,  you will need to buy extra memory, but it works with free mp3 players to load. the headphones are ear type so get a real pair, otherwise this worked great",5
"I have this unit with the 32 Meg Flash Card. When I first bought the product, I was running around like a happy fool glad to be ride of my walkman bouncing around my waste on short jogs. After the honeymoon was  over I started to have issues. The software that came with it, was the  music match software.It was good for only a limited number of plays before  expiry.I called diamond and they told me their RIO Port software was to  come out shortly. When the software did come out I found it didn't work  properly on the PMP300. I looked for some help files on &quot;configuration  / troubleshooting &quot; but there was none. Tech support told me this was  a known issue the pmp300 doesn't always show up as a configurable option so  reinstall the software. 3 reinstalls later I still couldn't get the Rio  port software to work, so I gave up and I just reinstall the music match  software when it expires every two weeks. Since then my LCD has become dim  and the plastic belt handle broke. The unit is about a year old now and  cost about 230 $ new.I really like my MP3 player but I will not buy  another RIO .I am looking at alternatives",3
"put all those stupid, fluffy descriptions aside because only 2 words are needed to describe these speakers - THEY ROCK!  Never thought I would pay so little for so much!",5
"These speakers are extremely good. The sound is very clear, the bass sounds very natural. Get them. I found them incredibly difficult to find, I searched over 20 sites until I finally got them. Amazon totally has a monopoly going on.  But anyway, bottom line, get these as soon as possible, because I remember when they were available for like $80 and when I finally found them at like the 23rd site they were $107. But they were worth it. Maybe watch it if they reach like $200. But otherwise, yes.",5
"These are not big speakers, but they have big sound.  If you decide to get a pair, you have to listen to the song, &quot;I love big speakers&quot;.  This has some good bass, that will show you what the speakers can do.  AWESOME speakers.",5
"Because these speakers still hold up here in 2007 against some of the newest and most expensive computer setups.  I remember when these first came out and were the first set of computer speakers to ever get a ""kickass"" review from the computer enthusiast magazine ""boot"", but I didn't buy these myself until 2003 when they were on clearance for super cheap.Kinda wish I had bought more of them when they were so cheap, since they're STILL pretty much the best 2.1 computer speaker setup you can possibly have.  The midrange these put out is unbelievable for a speaker this size.They look a little outdated (I have the black color so slightly less so), but damn do these sound good-and I've owned and heard pretty much every ""THX"" certified 2.1, 4.1, and 5.1 computer speaker ever made.",5
"I recently upgraded my stock Hewlett Packard Pavillion 9895 speakers to the Yamaha YSTMS50W 80-Watt 3-Piece Subwoofer/Satellite Computer Speakers.  First and foremost, let me tell you one thing: wow, and I really mean WOW, what a great set of computer speakers!Understand: you don't get full blown surround sound with these speakers -- few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway.  But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today, these speakers will, out of the box, work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards.  And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost.My only complaint (and it is an exeedingly *small* one) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker (volume and on/off) and the sub woofer (base volume) -- it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit (i.e. on a satellite speaker).  But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price.Net/net:1) Awesome (I would even say unsurpassed) sound quality to cost ratio2) Extremely easy set-up (took me less than 10 minutes -- and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room)3) Wished the connecting wires were longer (the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within 5 feet of the sub-woofer)4) Needs some industrial design tweaks (i.e. audio controls should all be in one place)5) Rich base, sweet high-ends, and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6) MUST HAVE FOR ANY AUDIOPHILE WHO IS ON A BUDGET",4
Nice headphones. No noise escapes the headphones to disturb others.  Got them for my daughter's keyboard.  She says the only negative is that they don't have much range of volume but still great for when you want to play  when others are trying to sleep or whatever.,4
"These headphones have some nice features. They are a nice shape that fits comfortably on the head. They are a nice size that are fairly easy to carry around for non-lightweight headphones. They also have a very nice long cord that gives a lot of reach. The only issue I have is that they are a bit more quiet and less responsive than other headphones I have used that cost about the same. If you want a nice pair of headphones that are easy to carry around, it's tough to beat these.",4
They are not exactly noise cancelling as I read in some of the reviews. You can hear the tv a little and the person watching the tv can hear a little bit of the music if it's loud. It does allow for the one practicing to hear their music well. For the price I'd say it's worth it if your child is always practicing the same time you need it to be quiet or the tv is on.,4
"This headset is inexpensive, so don't expect a product you will have for years to come.  However it has good sound and the ear foam is denser than most low end product which makes it comfortable.",4
"I purchased these headphones to go w/my electric piano and I am delighted w/them and so is my family!  Now I can practice as often as I want and not bother anyone,  Great sound and light on the head so no headaches and great price, very affordable!",5
I  chose this item to go with my synthesizer.  It fits perfect and I can hear very clearly.  It appears to provide a surround sound.,4
"The sound is good with these headphones and I use them to watch movies and You Tube.  My only problem is that after awhile the ear pads start to bother my ears and I have to take them off. It would be nice if there was an adjustment not only for size, but for width. It would also be nice if there was a little padding at the top. Otherwise they are good for the price and they are not big and bulky, which was why I bought them in the first place.",4
Got this for our student to practice whiteout any hassles.Decent material at the right price and it works!  Thank you Yamaha and Amazon!( but I'm still unhappy about needing to buy a power cord).,3
"I bought this for my son to practice piano with. He doesn't like his current headphone. It's the kind that covers the ears completely, and his ears turn red and itchy from it. This one doesn't cover the ears completely, but the foam part is still much bigger than your average headphone. So I took off the piano connector part and snap it onto the plug a cheap headphone with small foam area, and my son likes that way the best. I try to give the headphone to a different son but he doesn't like the feel either. Prefers the cheap ones he already has.The piano connector part snaps onto the regular headphone part tightly, plus it has an area you can grab onto so that you can pull everything out of the keyboard easily so that the piano part isn't stuck in the keyboard when you remove the headphone.So now I'm using in bed to watch movies on my computer while not disturbing my husband. It feels fine to me, but I have hair covering my ears. The sound is good. And it covers the sound pretty good. When I take off the headphone, I don't hear much from it.For the price, I think this is worth it.",4
"Terrific for making adjustment in each individual EQ for vocals and instruments.  Can help each voice, and instrument, sound better.  Plus it gives the vocals a better monitor mix.",5
"These inexpensive earphones provide adequate rendering of sound from TV, movies, etc.  However, in terms of comfort, they leave much to be desired.  The flat, hard plastic speaker enclosure is only covered by a thin, somewhat scratchy &#34;cloth&#34; material.  It provides inadequate cushioning of one's ears from the hard plastic of the speaker enclosures.  A cotton, or even a foam covering would be an improvement.",2
"Well built good sound worth the price, can be used for short and long range applications, multiple plugs makes it versatile.",5
These are light and inexpensive. Needed ones with this type of plug. Use it with a portable keyboard. Has a nice long cord. Didn't need a fancy stereo headset. The sound is good and they clamp well over my ears. Most of the fancier headphones start to fall off my ears even when tightening the head band to the max. Like the feather weight.,5
"It is absolutely useless.  The pictures are grainy, blurry, and have color aberrations galore.  You can't even see facial features on people.  It is not a true 640x480 camera; it uses software to obtain the 640x480 advertised resolution.  Downloads are horribly slow, and the memory is not removeable, so you can't use a better download method.  It will drain the batteries with only one loading and unloading of the 2MB memory.  This thing is not even useful as a toy for your children.  Fortunately I bought from a reputable online dealer who took the thing back, and even refunded all shipping charges.  Do yourself a favor and get an Olympus D-360L or D-460Z.  ...a lot more money, but about the least you can pay for a digital camera that takes decent pictures.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!",1
"I bought two of these for my kids and they are awful. The picture quality is so low that only about 10% of the photos are worth keeping. And being for my young children, my standards are very low. I bought them almost as a toy, and STILL I'm severely disappointed. DO NOT BUY.",1
"I bought the Smile to have a handy, inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages. I didn't want to spend $400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months. I figured for $100 I couldn't go wrong. I was mistaken.The Smile just has too many compromises. The lens is a tiny fixed-focus item that requires bright light to form an image. Battery life is abysmal- it seems to chew up a pair of AAs shooting a dozen pictures. I should have spent $200 and gotten a far better camera.",1
". STOP!!! . 1/ This camera is NOT 640x480, is a fixed 320x240. CCD is not  even 1/3 megapixel, is 1/10 I think. Images are bad (like enlarging a  thumbnail?) Print them in an 1x1 inch rectangle and they'll be somehow  fine, anything bigger is like old CGA... awful. When you take shots they  look very bad, whatever you do to  edit (software) and fix them. I have  another (true) 640x480 camera and pictures are excelent, but these...2/  It doesn't include an AC adapter, so be prepared to buy LOTS of AA  batteries or spend another 50 bucks.3/ Fine as a serial videoconference  camera (30 fps), but watch for the batteries.4/ Take your first picture,  and begin to wonder if it's ok. The lack of an LCD screen begins to bother  you when you find out you can't review your shots. Think about it: you wont  review your pictures untill you get to the PC.Sorry I am very  disappointed.",1
"I'm on a small budget this summer, so I bought this camera for fun. It doesn't drain your batteries before you even took a picture(I took about 40 pictures(without flash) with my cheap rechargeable batteries). The four  stars missing is for the worst quality I've ever seen in my life. I suggest  to never use the flash(all my pictures taken with flash were 90% full of  light, so it's all white!)This camera is too cheap(I think that my  batteries heavier than the camera itself)You only have to put the Cd  that it comes with it and it installs itself.I think uploading my  pictures(16) to my pc took 4 minutes!The camera was too easy to use and  I wonder why Agfa made these things.Finally, digital cameras are too  expensive and someday the prices will fall down and camcorders will take  better pictures... you will regret buying this awful camera!",1
"These speakers stunned me. When my tiny &quot;came with the PC&quot; speakers died, I looked into getting some similar little speakers, but then realized that I could spend just a few dollars more for this three speaker set.First, let me say that the subwoofer BOOOMS! The bass from the compact cube is deeper and more throbbing than my full stereo system. Really remarkable. I used this system in my dorm room at Columbia University this summer, and all my dorm mates were so amazed that the speakers were frequently borrowed for watching DVDs, and one classmate was so impressed that she bought her own set immediately a day after borrowing mine. With the massive BOOOOM of the system, it was easy to see why everyone was so enthusiastic.My only complaint, in fact, is that BOOM! The subwoofer doesn't have an independent volume control, so if I turn up the volume on the little speakers, the subwoofer follows right along, thunderously loud. A separate volume control on the subwoofer would have made this speaker set perfect.",4
"This speakers are great sounding little things for the computer.  If you are looking for a set of speakers with a subwoofer this is definately not a bad place to start.  I have two sets of them and have had no problems with them, and yes... They are loud.",4
"These speakers do not sound bad, don't get me wrong.  If the company had actually used a tad more thought when designing the cabling they would have a winner.  However, even the sound quality on these is not up to par with the set of Cambridge Soundworks/Creative Labs computer speakers I have that cost about the same price.The sub-woofer seems fine, but the satellites seem to have a much cheaper tinnier sound than the Creative Labs Speakers.  For gaming they sound fine, but music clearly sounds better on the Creative Labs speakers to me.But where these speakers truly fail the end user is in the wiring.  Unlike the Creative Labs set that is configured more like a standard set of stereo speakers, allowing you to position your satellites anywhere in the room to achieve optimal separation, the Altec Lansing set has very short cables.  The left speaker has to be within four feet of the subwoofer.  Then the right speaker has to be within six feet of the left.  Then to add insult to injury, the five foot wire from the computer to the speaker system has to plug into the left speaker.Worst of all, they hard-wire everything.  On the Creative labs system, the computer connects to the subwoofer which connects via standard speaker cable to the satellites.  Wonderful and simple design!!  The Altec Lansings have wires of non-standard configuration hard-wired into the left speaker and chincy speaker wire that is hard-wired between the speakers (Maybe if you rip them apart and splice wires you could expand it, but do you want to?).The easy configuration of your computer speaker system is a large percentage of its sound and convenience.  Dump these babies for the better sounding Creative Labs setup.",1
I got this from a yard sale. The cords are unwieldy. The bass is too strong and is not adjustable. Stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofers.,2
"Certainly not the best speakers you could ever have for your computer, the ACS33 nevertheless fills an important niche in the market.  If you're looking for subwoofered sound on the cheap, this is probably your best bet.  They're competent performers, without taking price into consideration.  Look at how much they cost, and you'll think there aren't better speakers made on the planet.  They have the potential to work, as do most speakers, on both Macintosh and Windows machines.Interestingly, they also have a secondary use.  Because they don't need a computer to work at all, they can be plugged directly into any stereo system that has the ability to output its sound (that is, one which has an AUDIO OUT jack).  They can thus give resonant stereo sound--even to lowly portables.  You'll think twice about whether you really need to upgrade to a whole new system after hearing these speakers.  (Before buying for this purpose, however, I'd recommend you go to altec-lansing.com and grab the manual for this product, just to make sure that it's compatible with your stereo.)Inasmuch as there are drawbacks to the speakers, they are ones you would expect from a product so inexpensive.  As another reviewer has rightly pointed out, there's no volume control on the woofer.  There's also no bass, treble, or speaker-independent volume control.  And the speakers are rated at only 10 watts, with a relatively indelicate frequency response.But, big deal.If, like most people, you've got your computer jammed into a corner in a busy room, you don't have the soundspace to set up a truly extraordinary auditory experience.  If you've got a lot of people living with you, anything more than 10 watts is discourteous, anyway.  Unless you have a room that you can dedicate to the computer, and that's relatively isolated from others, it's extremely unlikely you would actually be able to use more than this system offers.",4
"THE ACS33 SPEAKER SYSTEM CAME WITH THE PC I BOUGHT WAY BACK IN 2001.  THE PC WAS AN OFF-BRAND AT THE TIME, KNOWN AS ABS.  AFTER RESEARCHING MY OPTIONS FOR BEST PC UNDER $1000, I OPTED FOR THE ABS MAINLY BECAUSE THE REVIEW RAVED ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE CLEAR AND ACCURATE SOUND FROM THE INCLUDED SPEAKERS.  I STILL HAVE THAT PC AS A BACK UP, BUT I CONTINUE TO USE THE ALTEC LANSINGS LIKE A SMALL BOOKSHELF STEREO SYSTEM.  I HOOKED THEM UP BY SIMPLY PLUGGING THEM INTO THE HEADPHONE JACK ON MY MP3 PLAYER, AND THE SOUND IS JUST INCREDIBLE.  IT PUTS OUT 30 WATTS TOTAL, AS MUCH AS SOME BOOKSHELF STEREO SYSTEMS COSTING HUNDREDS MORE!  THE BASS IS INCREDIBLE...I HAVE IT SITTING ON AN AREA RUG SO I DON'T GET EVICTED. THE HIGHS ARE SO ACCURATE, AND CAN BE TWEAKED USING THE EQ ON THE MP3 PLAYER.  MIDRANGE IS A BIT LACKING, BUT THIS ALSO CAN BE COMPENSATED FOR A BIT WITH YOUR EQ SETTINGS.  IF YOU CAN FIND THESE USED, GET 'EM!",5
"I have to ring in on this item. I have owned mine for over 2 years now and I sit at my home office desk many hours a day talking into it.There are many more elaborate and MUCH more expensive items out there but my question is, why? Why would you spend 60 or 50 or even 20 dollars on something when this 10 dollar headset works as well as it does. I have never had anyone complain that my voice was weak or that I sounded odd when using this unit. In fact, I don't think anyone can ever tell I'm on a headset. I can hear the caller crystal clear and the noise cancelling mic delivers as it was meant to.In my opinion, manufacturers do not always put as much effort in the headset jack section of phones they do not expect to be used in an office setting. This is not to say ALL office or multi-unit phones are exceptional. Some of these are weak in this respect. With simple home phones, doubly so.My Motorola SOHO set has an excellent jack section. I mention this because this will have a huge impact on your experience with this or any headset.One huge problem for me with wired headsets has always been, when walking around with the unit on, I get the cord caught on doorknobs and various hazzards around the home/office. When this happens, it rips the phone off of your ear and has destroyed more than one more expensive unit. Hence, the willingness to try this less expensive unit. Funny thing is, although I've managed to rip this thing off several times, I don't seem to have damaged it in any way. It has outlasted every single headset I have ever owned. And it works and sounds as great now as it did the day I got it.I bought this thing figuring if it worked but only lasted 8 or 10 months, I could just buy another one and save some money going this route. Well, if it ever does break, I can assure you I will be buying another one!One side note, this makes a great gift for someone who wants a headset but doesn't want to spend the money for one. They'll never know you spent 10 dollars on it. Not that I would do anything like that ;>)If you cannot handle an over the ear headset, or if you are wireless, this is obviously not a fit for you. If you are using a wired headset, you should give this a try.",5
"If this is your first headset or you don't plan to have heavyuse, this is as good as it gets. ...the sound quality is goodand it is relatively comfortable. However, if you are going to spend time with this, the Plantronics M175 by far worth the additional expense. Much more invisible from the stand point of the user (you completely forget its on your head) and the listener on the other end. I have them both and switch to the Plantronics unit when I know it is going to be a long call or I going to be moving about.",4
"This lightweight headset does the job, and the price is right. It's held up well for 4 months of daily use. The fact that it lightly hangs on the ear rather than fitting snugly took a couple days to get used to, but it's nice that it is so light.",4
"This excellent headset in an outstanding bargin. Sound quality is excellent with several cell phones I have tried, and it is good with most cordless house phones (cordless phones sometimes have poor gain on the  mic).In fact, sound quality is vastly better with other types of  earpieces and ear buds. In a normal room, no one will know you are using  it. In a car, it is slightly noticable.Some friends complain that the  earpiece flops around a bit, but indeed, it never falls off. (Unless you  have really small ears).",5
"Not many things you can buy for $10 anymore.. but this is definitely worth the small investment.The headset is comfortable, has a good microphone/earpiece and is almost unnoticeable after a few minutes of use.  Make sure you have a phone with a good belt clip that isn't too heavy to carry around.  The only downside to the headset is that there is no volume control and no mute button, so it's best to get a phone that has these functions in the phone itself.  I use it with a couple of different cordless phones and it performs flawlessly with both.",4
"I was very disappointed with this product.As one other reviewer said the stem is too short.  So others can hardly hear me.  Obviously, if they can hardly hear me then what good is the product?  For instance, ever try getting a flight itinerary straight when the other person can hardly hear you?  (And I'm short myself, so it's definitely  not a matter of my having oversized head/mouth dimensions.)But, even when I took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low, though without background noise.I also found the headset somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to put on at the moment.  I don't have a need to wear one all the time, but just for certain calls.  I often found myself fumbling to get it on.  I think I'll try an over-the-head model next.",1
The mike wand is only 4 1/2 inches long.  Since I have 7 inches between my ear and mouth the mike did not get close enough and my voice was too low.  It was otherwise comfortable and I imagine it would be fine for a person  with a smaller face.,1
"This headset works very well for me. I was skeptical at first about the plastic thing over my ear, but it's so light that I scacely notice. I also worried becuase the mike wound up next to my cheek not my mouth, but it seems to have no adverse effect on the sound. People I'm talking to can't tell I'm using it, and to me the sound is great. At the price, what's not to like? I got one for each phone in our house.",5
I modded this to attach to my AD700X's. Perfect gaming headset now. I hear and speak with clarity now. Antlion ModMic broke and didn't feel like spending $50 plus on the 4.0. Bought the mic and  some mounting tape! Would recommend over and over!!!!,5
"I bought this mic to put it on my Audio-Technica headphone AD700s, I knew cutting the plastic headband off if the microphone was garbage I'd just have to eat the cost. Luckily as others have suggested on forums and even in reviews here the mic works great, had to use some industrial strength sticky tape to keep them on the metal of my headphones, but for the price this microphone is unbeatable in sound quality.",5
"This mic is very popular around gamers, espicially if you want to FraGTaLiTy's mic mod. This mic used to cost around $5 dollars. It's a great mic, but why is there a need to increase the price ten fold? I would just go with a Zalman Clip-On. If you have $50 to spend on a mic after $100+ on a headset and $130 on a mixamp go right ahead, but that is something that I will not be doing.",3
I've been using this mic for a couple of years now with a nice pair of headphones. Velcroed them on and they're good to go!,5
"I am a gamer, and I don't use headsets, i use headphones, with a seperate mic. I saw someone on head-fi.org who bought one of these and used industrial strength velcro to attach one of these to their AD700s, so i decided to try it with my AKGs. It works pretty well, but the mic is real quiet right out of the box, but after turning the volume all the way up and putting the microphone boost up to 10dB, it is super clear and crisp. If you put the mic boost up to 20dB you can hear large amounts of feedback (buzzing/humming noise), but that it not too big of a problem, because it works fine with a 10dB boost. I would recommend this to any gamer, but if you can spend a little more money, go for the ANT Lion Mod Mic V2.EDIT 10/8/13: I recently replaced the original cable with a cable that connects both the mic and the headphones in one cable, and has a volume control and mute button, and this seemed to reduce the amount of feedback (buzzing/humming noise).",4
"As I write this I am sad to say that my trackball is finally starting to show its age as it is becoming difficult to register clicks after 15 years of solid, daily use.The design put years back on the life of my wrist and saved me from certain carpal tunnel issues.It is not easy for everyone to get used to it as I have laughed at many who have tried to use my pc for something quick, but just like anything else it has a learning curve and I simply cannot imagine life without it.I came to Amazon hoping I could somehow score one of these without destroying my bank account and I fell on the floor when I saw what people are charging.The sad part is that I actually considered spending $500 on getting one of these for a few moments.If I knew 100% that any of these ridiculously priced trackball FXs on here were brand new, I would actually buy one.THAT is how good this thing is.",5
"This is a great large trackball that was discontinued after a few years by Logitech.It is however, very much a vintage collectible -- still functional as a trackball -- but not current cutting-edge technology.THE REVIEWS START IN 1999, PEOPLE.*  There's no way Logitech will provide a Windows 7 driver for this.Still many users believe this is one of the best trackballs ever made, comparable perhaps to theMicrosoft Trackball Explorer-- also no longer made.  A new MSTE one will set you back hundreds; they're scarce.*Amazon says they first stocked this in 1973? What is that, 22 years before Amazon launched? Wasn't the web called ARPANET then?",5
"This mouse has served me well for the past 10 years, and I hope it lasts another 10!  It's ergonomic, it doesn't need to be cleaned very often, it's very precise (far more precise than the thumb-balls Logitech currently sells), it has four buttons assignable to just about any function... superior in every way.Recently I tried to buy another one for work but couldn't find anything like it.  If you can find one, buy it!  ...and make sure to register it so Logitech realizes it's still popular!",5
"I have two of these, one I just bought (used-mint condition) and one I bought new several years ago which is now dead.  People who do computer-aided design and need fine cursor control absolutely love the FX because the large ball gives you just that - better fine control than any other mouse or trackball.  However, some actions, like drag and drop, are difficult to do with the traditional left button and ball, and instead require the use of the 3rd button as a drag lock, which is easy to do, but different than you may be used to -- once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  The fourth button can be programmed for scrolling.  The buttons are programmable - you can choose what function you want them to perform.The hand placement over the curvaceous FX body is also very comfortable and even relaxing - once you get used to it, and don't try to drag and drop with the left button and ball.  You can use both your thumb and one or even two or three fingers to move the ball around without ever tiring or straining.The downside of this model is that Logitech has abandoned it due to a patent infringement suit, and no parts are available for repairs, and no one I know repairs them.  To get a part, you must cannibalize another Trackman Marble FX, and the cannibalized parts will already be used and aged with a short life span -- assuming you can get a used one with still usable components.  There are no new FX's anywhere.Another downside is that the FX only came with either a serial port or a PS/2 connector.  There are no USB or wireless versions.  And every attempt to utilize a USB adapter results in some functionality being lost.  The serial port has long gone the way of the Dodo bird, and PS/2 ports are non-existent on new model computers.  In another 5 years the FX will be largely obsolete and incompatible.  This has already affected the going price.  Whereas a couple of years ago, even a poor-condition FX commanded a steep price, a mint-condition FX now command less than $100 (I won my minty for only $82 just yesterday as I write this). Yes, there are vendors still listing FX's near $300, but they aren't getting many takers, if any.The bottom line for this once very superior design is that apart from a few fanatics (like myself) who have yet to upgrade to a new USB-only PC (or Mac) the FX is dated, and soon will be obsolete and incompatible with the new equipment coming out.",5
"I'm writing this review in 2014, many many years after this device has disappeared from the company's product lineup. I can state that this is the best input device I've ever used. I've owned several, and had them on my work and home computers for very detailed CAD, 3D modeling, and precision Photoshop work. The downside with this (and any trackball or mouse) is that dust accumulates inside the housing but this is super easy to clean when it does. I occasionally think about replacements, even though it looks funny, even outdated, no one makes a &#34;fingertip&#34; controlled trackball with ergonomics quite like this so I stick with it. Logitech if you're out there, please bring us a modern version!!",5
"Once upon a time I got sick of the gunk build up on all the mice and trackballs I had used, it got to the point where they would bump and jump on the mouse pads.  I was intrigued when I saw the technology used in the  Trackman line, detecting position using the tiny dots on the ball.  Now  having used the FX Trackman at home and at work for over 3 years, I find  that it is the still the best input device of its kind, including the new  MSFT optical mice. Once one gets used to the button placement and develops  the dexterity to utilise the trackball, constantly smooth and consistent  movement will reward them. With no moving parts for the tracking assembly  the user only rarely [once a year?] has to pop the ball out and clean the  sensors. This trackball does very well in digital art work with Photoshop  and is especially excellent when used to play classic trackball arcade  games through Mame32 emulation, Missile Command, Tempest, Centipede,  Arkanoid, etc. The tertiary buttons are recognized and used as scroll wheel  counterparts in Win2k; it's a nice fluff feature. My only wish would be  that Logitech eventually upgrade them to use USB so I can plug them into my  MSFT keyboards. Otherwise, highly recommended.",5
"This is one great trackball. The product I bought is actually the Cordless version of the FX Trackball, but it's basically the same as this one except for the cordless/wireless feature. The ergonomics are a little different also but it's basically the same trackball device.You can't beat the smoothness of this trackball. I've seen lots of them over the years but none ever impressed me enough to buy one until now. Now that I've tried one I'm a convert. The action is extremely smooth once you adapt a little to the finger movements to move the ball. Also, getting used to the placement of the four different buttons takes a little time. But once this is accomplished the ability to move smoothly and quickly around your computer screen is vastly improved over a typical mouse.The buttons are all configurable as to function, but I've found sticking with the default settings during the software setup is the best way to go. There is one thing I am trying to see how it works out. I reconfigured button 4 as the delete key. This is sort of convenient because it allows you to browse and delete files just with the  trackball instead of having to use the other hand to hit the delete key on the keyboard after highlighting a file with the trackball. Pretty convenient for those occasional cleanup tasks on your hard disk.Another thing I have found useful is to use medium instead of low acceleration, which allows you to shoot all the way across the screen by moving the trackball maybe an inch and a half or so, but then to drop the overall sensitivity down a bit. The default setting for trackball sensitivity is right in the middle of the range on the slider adjustment bar. I drop it down one more tack on the slider bar. This assists in hitting all those small buttons when using high resolution on your monitor. The medium acceleration gets you there faster but then you have more control once you're there to zero in on the button. Try it and see if you like this better than the default settings. You will find these settings by opening up the Trackball program menu, clicking on &quot;mouse properties,&quot; and then on the &quot;motion&quot; tab.One last thing I do to customize the operation of the trackball is you can check a box that causes the cursor to jump to the highlighted button of a new dialog box. I find this useful also.I noted a very interesting new feature. One of the buttons when clicked pops up the &quot;Webwheel.&quot; This is a wheel with 10 different pie-shaped pieces which are configurable as web addresses or for other web-related functions, such as go back, reload, go to favorites/bookmarks, and so on. When you hit this button, the wheel comes up, and you basically have a second menu to choose selection from. Pretty cool.I should mention the software install is a little non-intuitive. The instructions say to disconnect your mouse and plug in the new trackball (with the power off). However, when you boot the machine, Windows 98 sees the now missing mouse and wants to autodetect your hardware again and recreate the entire driver database. Not knowing what would happen I just cancelled out of this screen and let the computer boot up normally but without any mouse function. I then loaded the software, using the tab key to navigate around to configure everything, which wasn't too hard, and after you are finished it asks do you want to reboot, and after that the trackball works normally.Although not cheap, all in all a fine product that is worth the money.",4
"I originally paid $64 for this trackball at Staples back in 2002. I'm impressed at how the value of this mouse, used, has gone into the hundreds. Yet, I'm not surprised. This is an amazing trackball because it involves the movement of any 2 of the 3 leftmost fingers of the right hand. This means your hand won't get into repetitive motions that may cause permanent damage later on. I have been using this mouse for years and it's still going strong. You just have to clean the ball and lenses once in a while. My mouse is PS/2 but I am ordering a converter (PS/2 to USB). Many attempts to convert me to other models have failed. My hand is completely comfortable and the buttons fall naturally where the fingers rest. Truly perfect design. I just can't believe it has gone up in price over the years, yet I can understand why. A true investment in the health of your hand, fingers and wrist. Totally worth the money.",5
"Its been about 10 years since I got my first TrackMan Marble FX. At this time I still have 3. Having tried just about every type and variation of input device on the planet, I never found any other mouse device the equal of the TMFT.Of course, being a 10 year old design, never updated, it lacks the buttons and scrolling abilities of modern mice. Which is too bad, because if Logitech revived this trackball, and updated it with 2 more buttons and new software, it would outsell everything else on the market by a wide margin.",5
"I have had three of these now in around 15 years.  Yes I said 15 years, or at least since they first came out.  They are the best trackball that was ever made,ever made.  They fit your hand like no other trackball out there including any that Logitech has made since.  I really hope that Logitech will make them again, because you can't beat them.  They are so expensive now that most of the time you can't find one that you can afford.  The few that are out there that are new are being sold for close to $500.  That is just unheard of.  Of course those doing that probably won't sell it or maybe they might.  Used ones are usually REALLY USED and the buttons will go out sooner or later.  But if you can find one that has the Logitech logo intact on the top and hasn't been rubbed off, then it wasn't used much because that is the first thing to go and it doesn't take long for that to go, maybe about a year or less of use. The one I have just purchased, the logo is sharp and so I know that it hasn't been used much. Even this one wasn't cheap, but it was cheap enough that I was willing to foot the bill for it because you can't beat this trackball.",5
"I've been using this trackball at work for six years and I love it.  I work in a 3D cad program that is primarily controlled by the mouse so it gets worked hard all day, every day.  This track ball never skips a beat and is comfortable to use, I find standard mice to be fatiguing.After more than twelve thousand hours of use the primary left button has given out on me.  The switch still functions but the button has broken and does not move anymore.  I am very disapointed to find that logitech no longer makes this trackball, I will be replacing it with a used one from ebay.",5
I got these because of the price and they not to bad a headset. They are very light and stay in place on your head. The mouth mic foam come off very easy but they work like they should.,3
"I like this headset. I have four of them. I find I use PTT most of the time, to avoid cut off first syllables, etc. When I absolutely have to be hands-free, though, the VOX will work, too. Decent, understandable audio, unlike some I've used",4
"These work perfectly with my Motorola MR350 radios, also purchased fromAmazon. I got them (headsets) only as an after-thought. The sensitivity settings on theradios (for head-set-use) for VOR use are a little touchy. I prefer using thePTT button WITH headsets connected... No breathing or extraneous soundskicking in the transmitter. Still, a good headset.",5
These work very well with my walkie talkies and give you some privacy when talking through the walkie talkies.  I highly recommend them.,5
"I bought a new pair of Motorola Talkabout FV300 radios and it simply does not work with them.  When I plug it in, turn it on and press the PTT button, the radio starts transmitting and doesn't stop until I shut the radio off.  I knew the VOX feature wouldn't work, but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the PTT button.  It does not.  However, it does work with my older Talkabout which is a T5000, but not with VOX.  I'm giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which don't.",2
"Works well.Only issue I have is it appears to automatically activate VOX mode. And I'd rather use PTT.Other note might be that compared to the old spirit gt headset, it's not a comfortable. But it's good enough.",4
Purchase for the Motorola MS350R 35-Mile Talkabout Waterproof 2-Way Radios. The VOX feature automatically sets up when this is plugged in.,5
"This is very good headset, sound quality is good. The headband is adjustable and very confortable. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't do VOX with my FR50s (because the FR50 doesn't have VOX capability). Price is reasonable too. What more can I say about a simple headset?",4
"Okay, it doesn't use batteries, it doesn't light up, and it doesn't cost a lot. But this headset/boom mic is an essential accessory for the TalkAbouts for this simple reason: TalkAbouts have voice-operated control (VOX) when  used with a plugin headset/mic. We have also evaluated the earbud/mic combo  for bike riders and found it almost unworkable (it picks up road noise and,  to me, the earbud causes excruciating pain after a day of use). The headset  is a much better solution. The band actually fits OVER a safety helmet, and  the closed-foam-cell rubber pad grips the plastic shell securely. The boom  mic rejects most road noise, and soon becomes forgotten in the course of  routine use. (It quickly comes back to the foreground when I try to sip  from my water bottle!) If you purchase one of the TalkAbouts, consider this  as your second accessory purchase -- your first should be a carrying  holster or case. Now, if Motorola would only agree on a partnership with  JABRA Technologies to produce a JABRA Earset for the TalkAbouts, my  happiness would be complete ...",5
"Plugged this into a Talkabout T6200 and it just transmitted.  Transmit button didn't work, VOX didn't work.  I have a pair of some older model, I should try the headset on those.Would give this 0 stars if I could.",1
The item served its use; however not the quality I thought it was priced at.,1
Good product at a good price.The earpiece has soft foam so that it does not hurt the ear after hours of use as one finds with an ear bud or the over the ear headset.Be careful to match the headset to the actual radio purshaced. This headset does not work with all radios.,5
"This mic works well, but it's a bit awkward.  I got it because the webcam I was using didn't have a built-in microphone for my Yahoo Messenger and Skype live chats.  It was crisp and clear sounding, but I've since upgraded my webcam and no longer need it so much.",4
"Good quality, good audio and made by Motorola. Was going for a ear cover design but this is way sleeker.",4
"I bought these earbuds specifically for my helmet and ease of use.  As it turned out the reception for these at high speeds was unreadable and even worse when transmitting.  Not good if you are looking for a cheap solution to communicate between motorcycles.  The boom mic's sold by Motorola are perfect for this...static communications this set up is fine, hiking, skiing, something like that.  For the purpose that I purchased them for, awful...overall product though, good.",3
I found that the ear bud was very large for my ear and it kept falling out even though it was under my pull over hat.  It works fine and the push to talk button by the mic bud is a nice feature.,3
This is a nice addition to my walkie talkies. Make sure you have the right model Walkie Talkies for this Mic.,5
"...There are quite afew out there that are more bulky looking. This particular one is more compact. Its features include: an earbud with a mic and PTT (push-to-talk). THe cord is a bit short; however, with my height (5,6), it stands to be just right. I was told that an extension can be pick up at a local Radio Shack.",5
"Excellent Motorola quality and when paired with the TA280's excellent volume levels (plus control), it allows you to use it even in crowded, noisy environments.  The ease of use and its inconspicuousness make it an invaluable addition to the Talk Abouts, but there is room for improvement.  My biggest complaint is that the TA280/289 don't allow for the alert tone (call tones / menu tones / etc.) volumes to be regulated.  This makes for some very uncomfortably loud noise spikes with that earbud only an inch or so from your eardrum.  The TA280/289 DO allow the alert tones to be disabled, but that makes it a little more difficult to operate (especially when you have them tucked away under your outer clothing). My only other complaint was in the design of the PTT/MIC housing.  I would've preferred something a little easier to use with gloves on (the PTT button is 1/2&quot; from the MIC and pressing it with gloves on covers the MIC....). In closing, the alert tone volume issue is a TA280/289 one, not this units and I'd buy this again if I were to lose this one, but I sure wish they'd improve on it.",3
"This product does exactly what its supposed to do. I don't understand people who expected this product to support VOX. It does not say anything about VOX in product description. I personally don't like VOX, because I don't want my children to hear what I'm saying when I fall down while skiing :-).Anyway the product is OK. The only problem for me is a very short wire, that's why I gave it 4 stars.",4
"Very dissatisfied with this, the earphone (earbud) is fine, but your voice is very muffled and garbled using the microphone. Even a females voice, usually more clear than a males voice, is very hard to understand using the microphone. I have also not been able to get the iVox feature to work with this either.",1
Worked but not well made and I have stopped using them and bought a better quality earpiece they did however work,3
I purchased these to use with the Motorola TalkAbout and the cases while biking to work.  I sometimes rode a little faster than my biking partner and these helped us to stay in touch.  This was a good purchase.,5
"I have only one complaint about this earbud/mic unit - the cord is too short. Otherwise, the sound quality is good and the built-in mic with PTT works fine. A 2.5mm extension cord from radio shack (meant for phone headsets, #43-2003) alleviates the cord problem, however. The earbud cushion is comfortable. To be discreet, this is an excellent accessory for your Motorola FRS radio.",4
Works good but I'm worried for how long. The wire is thin and I'm always worried its going to break at the many connection points. Works with the Motorola two way radios.,3
"If the cord was 1 foot longer, 5 stars.  I don't get it.  Is someone saving 2 cents for every one of these?  Or..  make the earpiece cord shorter and the thicker part longer.  Would have been great if it came with a removable ear clip/wire but not really complaining about that.  Maybe a future feature.  Then again, if they can't make the cord 1 foot longer, I wouldn't expect any other luxuries.  Functionally seems fine.",4
This push to talk ear bud worked great needed it for work and it never failed me. Would purchase again.,5
"I was wondering why the radio would go into a weird locked mode in which you could no longer use it.  I had to shut the radio off, then turn it back on again.  Just a slight movement from the male plug (that goes into the radio), would cause the radio to be unusable.I found out the male plug was not inserted all the way into the radio's headset socket.  The problem is the rubber molding around the male plug was too much, not allowing a good &#34;seat&#34;.  I used an Xacto knife and cut away at the rubber molding, thus allowing a good &#34;seat&#34; of the male plug.  No more weird locking of the radio anymore.  I also had to do this with the other Motorola headsets that came with my Motorola Radios as well.",2
We all use these with our Motorola radios while hunting.  The animals are not spooked due to the earpiece.  The earpiece fits comfortably in my ear without the foam.  Just press the button clipped to your collar and others can hear you even with a quiet whisper.,5
"The sound quality is good. I purchased these to plug into walkie talkies. As someone who's been use to wearing the actual walkie talkie unit on his pants I had to begin to clip it on my shirts because the plug and its cord are short and tight. If I wear the walkie on my belt and have the speaker on my shoulder, the audio jack always pulls out of the walkie unit because of the tension.For my purposes these are not ideal and if you are use to wearing the walkie unit on your belt line then don't purchase these.If you're okay with wearing the walkie unit on your shirt or somewhere a lot higher than your belt line then go for it.",2
"I haven't really tried this yet, it hangs in my wah and whacks me in the head while I'm driving....I have to rig up some cord restraints that will allow me to still use the thing....I think it will help me communicate when I get the instalation worked out",4
i bought this because when i do my volunteer work it is extremely hard to hear. so with this one i could hear everything that goes over the radio. THIS IS A 1 PIN REMOTE SPEAKER. YOUR RADIO NEEDS TO HAVE A SLOT FOR 1 PIN TO USE THIS.pro.-built nicely-able to have the radio on low and still be able to hear everything (keep in mind of the noise around you)-push to talk built incon-i use a safety pin so i could attach it my uniform better. may pull the clothes down a bit (need to break in the wires has to be looser) this is something smallthis does have a clip on the back of the speakers but i dont like to use it.overallprice cheaper now compared to when it first name came out (about $15 less)sound goodjust overall its very good.i would recommend this.,5
"Bought it for skiing and although its convenient, its hard to understand people on it. I think itay just be the cold temperature but its been pretty awful about every time I've skied. I used it on a warm day to test it and it seemed fine though. Guess it just isn't great for what I had in mind . The cord is also very short.",3
"These Motorola mics worked great for our GMRS radios.  Our crew prefers using these in the attics instead of pulling the walkies out of their pocket or belt clips.Speaker:- When you plug in the microphone the sound you hear come out of the mic- When you press the transmit button on the mic or the radio the microphone acts like a microphone.- Sound quality is nice- Volume is adjustable by volume control on radioCord:- My main gripe is the cord- The coiled cord on the new mics are tight from waist to shoulder- By stretching the coil out this problem goes away. Almost wish that the cord came pre-stretched so the new cords weren't so tight.Clip:- The clip clips at the top of the mic.- It would have been better if the clip swiveled on the back of the mic as everyone doesn't like to clip the mic on their shoulder lapel or collar. I prefer the mic in front of me and being able to swivel the clip would have been a major plus.Quality:- The mics are high quality and work well.  Out of the 8 I ordered I only had to return 1 due to failure right out of the package.Overall, great mics at a descent price.  At first the cord will be annoying but with time it should stretch and work better on adults. May look a little funny though if all your kids had these mics on their shoulders. People may give you strange looks.",4
"Motorola 53724 Remote Speaker Mic works well with my scanner, with the speaker mic my radio sounds loud and clear.",4
"The mic works well, and has a built in speaker, so you can have the audio feed close at hand.Sadly, the cord is so taught and tightly wound, there is no possible way to have the radio at waist level and the mic at shoulder level.  After months of trying to stretch the cord, it remains as short and tight as the day I received it.  When it was attached at shoulder level, the radio often jumped off of my belt (and survives only because the cable did not detach, and the radio did not ever strike the ground).  I have been relegated to attaching the Mic to my tie at about sternum level, which works but requires a higher audio level output than if it were on my shoulder near my ear.I give it four stars because it does what it says it will do, keeps me from having to constantly remove and replace my radio (and also, because after my repeated stretching attempts, the cord has not shorted out... no small feat).I truly wish it were more flexible or longer, but I guess it does the job.",4
"Used for a long road trip with 2 Cars. The Cord lenth isn't horrible, it was ok for my use but I agree... it could be longer. Overall for the 13 bucks I paid for a used one was worth it.",4
We purchased two of these in hopes of keeping the radios from falling and breaking.  This would keep the radios in our guys pockets.  Worked great for two weeks then nothing.  For both of them.  They are heavy and seemed well made.  Bummer.,2
It looked good in the box but after hooking it up to my 2-way radio i soon realized it's a joke. You can hear people through it but couldn't talk through it. I had to unplug the mic if I wanted to talk to anyone. 100% waste of $20. I would return it but my luck with getting my money back when I return something isn't good since I never do. Save your $20 and buy something else.,1
"i was a bit concerned my older Motorola 2-way radio wouldn't work with this product so took a chance, but works flawlessly and have purchased a second one for skiing.",5
It works very well with all the talkabout radios I have. Only drawback is the clip started to break after 10 days of daily use in the Florida parks. When the clip breaks it gets annoying having to carry it in your hand.,3
Purchased for the Motorola MS350R 35-Mile Talkabout Waterproof 2-Way Radios the mic comes in handy if you keep the radios on you hip.,5
I bought this product for the handhelds I bought a couple of weeks prior. I used this for my job because I was not always in the cafe and if something was needed from the storerooms or there was a customer complaint/problem. They worked great and did as I expected to!,4
I got these for my hunting radios they work great and make suiting up easy radio chest pocket mic on your lapel good to go.just one thing that little made in china badge on it errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,5
"I am impressed with this speaker/mic. I'm a first responder so I was interested in getting something like what I have at work for my family radios. The mic is VERY sensitive, so have it about 6-12"" away from your mouth and talk normally... they will hear you fine.  The weight feels very substantial in your hand and feels almost as rugged as what I have at work. I can tell that this is a Motorola product.",5
"These mics are pretty legit.Speaker Quality:The speaker quality is pretty good just as long the user on the other end does their part in speaking into the mic correctly.  I have the MR350R waterproof version and the remote speaker is pretty close to the quality of the handhelds speaker.  The remote speaker does have a bit more treble to it but not bad enough to where its a problem.Durability:The plastic housing isn't the thickest, but thick enough to where it is durable enough for normal use unlike the remote mics for law enforcement.  The feels very sturdy and durable.  Only gripe about the cord is that it is quite short and the coil makes it tight from waist to lapel.  Some may want this but if it weren't as tight and uncoiled easier then it would probably be better.!!!UPDATE!!!I used this remote speaker mic for 5 days while snowboarding.  I wore it on the strap of the backpack where it was exposed to snow and cold constantly.  I'm not the best snowboarder so I was in the snow all over the place.  The mic isn't labeled as water proof or even weather resistant but it definitely got wet and still works like a charm.  The clip was strong enough and never fell off of the strap even after all of my spills.  I love this thing and want to use it every chance I get.",5
"I have only had it about a week, but I needed it to use with my Motorola Walkie Talkie.  I walk about 2 miles a day even in the the cold weather we had this season.  My radio kept dieing out when I tried to use it to talk to my husband on my walk from home to a high school on the other side of I96 here in Redford, MI.  The cold was a major factor and I tried insulating the radio but it still was dieing out a few days after recharging my batteries.  I could have recharged the batteries every couple of days that would have helped, but I try to let them run down before charging.  Plus pushing the button is cumbersome with a hand that has to have both a glove and a mitten on to keep reasonably warm.  I did buy another small set that had an earphone, but the sound was not loud enough, I may have dome some damage to that set that caused that problem, don't know, but needed to try something a little more workable so we bought this, and I clip it on the pocket just below my collar and put the radio inside my coat which is in the middle of the coat above my waist.  So I was able to find a good position for everything and so far this has been my best solution. I will probably even use it in the summer because of the ease of use.  My husbands voice comes in loud and clear and it is minimum inconvenience to push the button even with a double protected hand.  The button is longer than the one with the earphone, it works great.",5
"This mic is perfect for the person who must have his/her hands free a majority of the time.  I use it on an older Motorola T5500 radio.  The mic comes with a strong metal clip to attach to your clothing or belt.  The speaker sound quality and volume is very good and the PPT button on the mic is easy to use.  The connector is a press fit so if the cord is stretched too far the connector may disconnect.  A small ""tie wrap"" wrapped around the cord and the radio antenna will solve this issue.",5
"I've been using for 2 weeks now for work communications, with only one problem. The coiled cord is so stiff it pull the mike off wherever I clip it. Either make cord 4-6 inches longer, or she more flexible cord.",4
"Nice having a speaker mic. Setting the channel on the radio and putting it in the side pocket of the pack and only having the speaker mic on the shoulder strap. Too bad Motorola can not reduce its weight. When hiking, every ounce counts.",4
I havent had a chance to use the casettes yet but since they are brand new in an unopened factory package I am sure they are just fine. Im just glad they got here quickly!!,5
"What can I say about this product, fair price and gets job done.  Seems to outlast competition with repeated use.",5
"Not sure if these tapes are knockoffs, but these tapes jam in our Sony BM-575 portable recorders.  They seem to work OK in our Lanier desk recorders.If we hold one of the the Sony cassettes next to a TDK cassette (which work fine in the BM-575) the tape in these Sony cassettes looks visibly taller.Unfortunately we are stuck with about 30 3-packs now.  I do not recommend this seller or these tapes.",1
"My idiot producer lost my recorder, so did not get to use more than one of these.",4
"I received these in perfect condition. They are used with a mini-cassette recorder. I have trouble with good sound from the cassette recorder, so I don't know if I have the correct type of cassettes or the recorder is of poor quality.",4
"Someone borrowed my sony mini tape recorder to get some detailed infomation and asked if they could keep the tape. I assured them that was fine I would just buy some. Boy, was I surprised when I checked out all the local stores to find that all that was available was digital recorders. So I checked out Amazon and there they were...so thanks for the variey of products supplied by the sellers on Amazon.com!",5
"For several years my brother had a similar (though significantly less durable) in-car trash bag. It was slightly larger but, not having the elastic top, simply spilled things if you filled it up. The velcro on the bottom also wasn't ""fold-over"" like this. Not that I intend to try myself, but I've seen liquid poured into these with little to NO leakage! That's wonderful! Heaven forbid the idiot in the back seat throws an ALMOST empty soda in upside down! lol I also got some comparably sized trash bag inserts that are held in by the elastic top band nicely! This prevents ANY spilling and makes for easy disposal! Tie the top, unvelcro the bottom, and slide out your sealed trash bag! Works MUCH better than my plastic grocery bag hanging off one side of the shifter! (also doesn't take up leg room in the passenger seat!)Excellent product, especially from the price!",5
"The only reason I didn't give this 5 starts is because I'm having a problem finding a place to hang it.  NOT a product problem, it's an issue with me and my vehicle (I don't want to block vents by attaching this to the passenger area in front.  Also note mine came with a webbed, adjustable strap - not the string setup in the picture.",4
"This bag seems durable, the elastic top keeps stuff from flying out, and the easy dump bottom makes dumping it in the dumpster easy.  What more do you want from a trash bag?",5
"I bought this to go in my '05 Subaru Impreza OBS, since I needed a new one to replace one that I bought 10+ years ago. This one totally puts that bag to shame, as lame as that may sound. The elastic top keeps the trash in, and the rolled bottom makes releasing the trash very easy. I appreciate the way that it hangs as well, keeping its top frame from being too cumbersome and taking away any of my valuable space inside my compact car. Great purchase, and for a killer price.",5
"this is a small and cute bag, a book size.If you have a long drive trip, you may need a bigger one, except dump it often.if you have kids on the trip, you need a bigger one.",4
"I like this trash bag it fits the bill for me pretty well.  Just about the right size bag I'm not sure I would want it any bigger,I think it would get in your passengers way as they get in and out.  I really like the elastic closure on the top if it does get bumped nothing spills out.  Its also really easy to empty with the velcro along the bottom.  I use this in my work car and I am going to purchase another for my personal car.",4
"This bag is great for keeping the trash together in one spot in the car.  Before I got it I would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks, which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor. This handles that pretty well. Couple cons though, it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly (make sure to check out the dimensions), and it is not always easy to empty out.  The velcro does hold the bottom closed very well, just if it is really full, you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it.  This is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor, and I am very happy with the purchase.",4
Great solution for my car. It hasn't failed in any way. I've used it for over a year now and would certainly rather have it than not.,5
"I have tried other bags..  This one is unobtrusive so it doesn't detract from the looks of my interior.  Because it has a cinch top rather than a flap, it is easy to drop things into it without being distracted.  This is my favorite feature...  the hole is big enough to put things in but small enough to keep them there.  The small piece of velcro keeps it affixed.  My former bag had a long piece and I didn't want to stick that to my nice car....  It empties easily.Really, this does the trick.  I resisted crapping up my car with a trash bag for so long... but realized I was crapping up my car with wrappers and other misc trash.  This is really good.",5
"Neat little s/w radio. Made a great gift. Great price,fast delivery.",5
"I was expecting the G2000A to be much better made than it appears to be.  The case is plastic, and not particularly good plastic at that.  The seams between the front and back halves of the case don't fit together well, leaving an unpleasant sharp edge.  The leather cover is nice, and, unlike the plastic case, gives the radio the feel of an item that apparently once sold for $180, or there abouts.I bought the radio thinking it would be an excellent travel alarm/radio.  However, in reality it's much larger and heavier than I expected.The above criticisms all pale into insignificance compared to the reception and sound quality.  Both are extremely poor.  This radio can only lock onto the strongest of stations, and even then there is a fair amount of accompanying 'hiss'.  I don't live in an area with great radio reception; however, my Boston Acoustics Receptor radio has no problem tuning into most stations.  If the Grundig scans the fm band it only finds a grand total of 3 stations.  Short wave is basically worthless on this radio (as is the AM band).For $40 this radio is not a particularly good buy.  There are much better radios for the same price, or significantly less.  The leather cover adds a bit of uniqueness.  In its absence, this radio would be worth $20, at the very most.Bottom line - This radio looks really nice in photos, but dissapoints in reality (both in terms of fit and finish, and tuner quality).",2
"The Grundig G2000A is like the pre-TV series Anna Nicole Smith:  hot looks, feels great, but not something you want to have around day in and day out.To be sure, it's one of the nicest-looking radios you'll find, but as a shortwave receiver, it lacks a lot:  doesn't tune the whole SW spectrum (why these radios just don't cover the full 1.7- 30 MHz range is beyond me) sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired, and selectivity (ability to separate closely-spaced stations) is in adequate.  Plus, the audio is on the tinny side.  For the $80 or so bucks you will normally pay for this, you can do much better.  Probably Grundig's worst model.",2
"JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product.  To bury the fact that this item is ""reconditioned"" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful!  They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.",1
"Beauty is deceiving. The worst thing about this radio is that the plastic on/off button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach. Get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick. Keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best, and confusing to use. The plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion. Thousands of these must be sitting in drawers, silenced by the elements! Junk...that's why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers.",1
"I've had a couple of these radios. For the most part I've been really happy for many years. Its great for a simple transistor radio type sound quality. I am not a short-wave person so I cannnot comment on that feature. FM and AM reception are terrific in Orlando. Battery life is great too. I have had 3 of these over 12 years.The first model was used reliably for 8 years. 5 of those years were in the bathroom exclusively. I finally wore out its AM/FM/SW selector by sliding it back and forth between AM Talk and FM stations daily 10s of times. At that point I bought a second.This second model had suede inside its leather cover and a cheap shinyish silver finish. The buttons felt cheap and it ran for about 4 months and completely died, no audio, no readout, dead. The model appeared to be the same but quality was aweful compared to what I had before.I then sought an older, smooth leather interior covered model through ebay. It has functioned perfectly for the last few years on a high humidity bath windowsill.",5
"The best looking Radio in the world, you will love it no matter what. Handsome little machine.",5
"I bought this Grundig Porsche Radio at Staples a number of years ago when they were getting out of the product line.  I wasn't even shopping for one.  I grabbed it in a bargain bin for $25 since it had no box, no manual, no accessories, and was a display model, although it spent its time behind a case.Unimpressive performance with very poor signal resolution, awkward volume control which forces you to open the leatherette case to get to this slide control (DUMB!).  I've stacked it up to both more expensive radios that I own and less expensive ones (CCRadio2, Kaito KA009S, Radio Shack Optimus PLL 12-808, Midland ER102MO, two table radios - Bose Wave Radio, and Kloss Tweeter label).  It comes in last every time.For local powerful radio stations it works fine (but then so does a crystal radio with a short antenna...) challenge it a bit and its good looks get annoying really fast.  Use it for shortwave and you will find yourself shopping for something, anything that can pick up any but the most obvious and strong SW transmissions.  If I had paid any more for it, I would consider it to be as valuable as an old brick.Reviews on [...], a site dedicated to DXing and Ham radio operators, place this unit dead last amongst the significant numbers of receivers reviewed.  (1.8 points out of 5)Stay away unless you can get it for a few bucks used or on clearance and already know that what you are going to listen to is AM, powerful, and not likely to challenge the tuner end.",2
"I have been a shortwave buff and radio collector for many years . I have a large collection of radios . Grundig over the years has made many good products ,however , the G2000a is certainly not one of them . I will concur that it is beautifully designed ,has nice leather case and the FM section sounds decent . The AM and SW sections are practically useless . Lots of interference and noise . Only can pick up strong signals and I have experienced fading on those stations . DXers should pass it by!",2
I've had my radio for about six months now and I could not be happier.  It pulls in stations from all over the globe 24 hours a day.  It is easy to use and extremely reliable.  I recently took it to Mexico with me so I could keep up on U.S. news and it provided me with several U.S. broadcasts.  I love this radio.,5
"This, along with the Sony ICF-7600G are among the two best portable shortwave radios offered by Amazon at this time. Both have their advantages and it is up to the user what is most important. The Grundig YB-400 is a  fairly easy to use radio that allows the user to punch in the desired  frequency, enter it into one of 40 memories, or scan desired bands to find  a station of interest. The Grundig's best asset is its great audio. It is  definitely the best audio I've heard from a shortwave portable and makes  listening a real pleasure. If you live or travel to any part of the world  other than Europe or eastern North America the Grundig YB-400 is the best  you can buy. If you live in one of those two places consider the Sony,  which has a synch. detector that allows you to reduce interference from  adjacent stations. This is important in areas where there are a high number  of strong stations crowded next to one another. In any case, both are well  worth the money.",5
"I've been collecting radios for a couple of years now, and own over 75 (at last count).  They range from old tube-type AM table radios to early transistors to the latest and greatest.  Let me tell you what I think about the Grundig YB400-PE:Strong points:1)  Solid-feeling quality.  It doesn't feel cheap when you pick it up.2)  Good sensitivity across all bands.3)  Nice, full sound from the internal speaker.4)  Accessory package includes a good quality soft case, AC adaptor, bud-type earphones, and 23' compact SW antenna5)  The ability to switch tuning increments to help fine tune in a hard-to-tune station.Not-so-strong points:1)  Only 40 presets.  I don't need 200, but it would be nice to be able to separate them into ""folders"" for AM, FM, SW.2)  Battery life is acceptable, but definitely not exceptional.  I usually plug in the AC adaptor because of this.3)  I wish it had a rotary tuning and tone (bass/treble) knobs.  Why?  I just like them.4)  The backlight is very weak -- a poor choice of LED'sI know a lot of people find SSB reception to be important, but I rarely use it.  As often as not, I like to just tune around the SW bands at night and see what I can find.  Sure is interesting to hear the viewpoint that other parts of the world have about the US.I'm a radio fan, not a radio geek.  I just like to play around with radios that are easy and fun to use and sound good.  If you're like me, I'll bet you'll like this radio.  If you're a geek, you may have more bones to pick with it, but on that I really cannot comment.",4
"The good stuff:-BFO for SSB-will tune in 1 KHz steps-very very good sound through phones( if you have good ones)-very good sound with built in speaker-FM stereo through phones-very good FM-good AM/MW-good SW with whip ant.-handy reel ant.-very good owner's manual with frequency guide for ameteur,aironautical,and maritime.-nice case-built very well with good quality feel to it.Things that bug me,but not too much:-Bass and Treble would be nice,but if not CAN'T WE AT LEAST HAVE A TONE KNOB? Not even the famed Sony 2010 has one! Why not? The hi/low switch is better than nothing,and does an ok job.-No rf gain control.Two way dx/local switch only-no tune knob just up and down buttons,so it's a bit of a pain to band scan.Push push push push push push push.Can tune in 1 KHz steps.-BFO only. No usb/lsb.Tunes in 1 Khz steps with bfo ""fine tune"" knob.Still ok for ssb ,just could be better.-no sync detector.Hay,what do 'ya want for that price ?-Cheezy ""earbud phones"". Then again, did you ever get a decent pair of headphones with anything? Not me.Spend a little and get some Koss ""Porta-pro"" phones.You will never go back to cheap ones again!-dial light only stays on for 10 sec.Don't let all of this talk you out of one though.What it does it does well....All in all: A fine little radio esp. for the $. Quite good sound with the speaker,and very very good through phones.Good MW/Am dx( not a 2010 or RF-2200 but,still a lot better than you might think).Good with just the whip ant. for SW.Very good FM.I think it's by far the best radio you can get for the money....grab one while you can still get a new one....8)",4
"I have had this for a week and it is the best radio I have ever owned. It is portable and fits very ergonomically friendly into you hands. There are 40 memory presets. The BIG shortwave broadcasts (BBC, Radio Canada, Voice of America) came in very clear and those are really the only ones worth listening to on a regular basis as most of shortwave is flooded with religious programming and politically slanted news.  FM reception is very good and AM is about as good as my other radios. The dial light and LCD readout could be stronger and bigger. It comes with an adaptor. Sleep timer and alarm works just fine. Has two times (for GMT/UTC and local time). It looks great with its platinum case. I highly recommend this. It costs more but if you love radio and want BBC and VOA, this is the one to get.",5
This is a great radio. It arrived on time. It is everything it said it was and more. I would recommend this radio to everyone. This is my second Grundig and I enjoy them both.,5
"I have many shortwave radios around the house and use them primarily for easy access to many regular AM and FM stations.  I use a Sony SW7600G (black version) as a clock radio because it only has 10 presets per band.  It's how you switch the stations that's important and the YB400PE requires you to key in two digits plus the enter key to change stations--if the memory preset is two digits, why do you have to press enter?  The Sony takes one keystroke (granted, though, the new silver-colored Sony doesn't do this either).  Surely if you're looking for programs on the same shortwave frequencies this is useful, but the frequencies change so much I always use the WRTH and PTWBR books and never use the presets.The sound is much, much better than the Sony.  It has deep bass and clear sound for both speech and music.Aside from choosing memory presets, this radio would be more perfect if it had synchronous detection where the carrier is discarded and a sideband is used for better audio.  The Sony has this and it completely removes interference form RFI sources like computers and fluorescent lamps.Bandscanning is okay if you don't mind the muting every time the frequency changes (some people call this ""chuffing"").  The automatic seek stops on the noisiest frequency, not just one with a carrier.The radio is made in China and has been re-branded as Eton recently.  I have one of the pre-Eton Chinese-made models but I wonder how much better the old Taiwanese version was.***EDIT*** After about four years of daily use the sound has finally deteriorated.  I notice that after about two hours' operation something overheats and the sound becomes muddy and distorted.",4
"DO NOT BUY.  My father bought a new YB400 for me for a graduation present in 1995.  I have never been able to pick up any SW station. I am in Colorado now, 100km away from the high power time stations, and I can't pick them up.  Just hear buzzing noises.  Nothing on LW either.  AM (MW) reception is poor but it does get some stations.  This was really expensive to turn out to be an FM clock radio.  The FM reception is good, the clock works fine, the light is nice.  Equivelent to a nice $20 radio for 8 times the price.",1
"I have had this radio for 3 years. It has worked well and has good sound quality as well as very decent shortwave performance for the price.Pros: Great value for price and I recommend the purchase if you want a good shortwave radio with stereo FM capability.  The cons which follow would not prevent me from making this purchase again.Cons: The packaging is (injection molding plastic fit/finish and design) is poor and much like a product that costs $20.  It has not failed but just leaves a bad taste compared with Japanese competition.  What is worse is the legend for the features that one would use in low light conditions such as alarm is medium blue against black, small letters.  They can't be read easily in normal light, much less normal household lighting.  The logic is typically German...like my 2 VWs...they seem to do things in a way that is different from anyone else and thus it is not intuitive without reading the manual...again, if it is a seldom used feature.  Also, a tone control instead of a switch would have been nice as well a ability to charge batteries while plugged in.",4
"I've had the opportunity to compare the Grundig YB400PE to several premium radios, the Tivoli PAL, the Sony ICF SW35, the Grundig S35, the Sangean 505, and the Kaito 1102. How does it rank? It ties for second with the aforementioned radios for FM. First place goes to the Kaito 1102. For AM, it takes a tie for last place with the Sangean 505. Even the reception strength meter shows a weak signal for 790 AM, a major Los Angeles station. In contrast, my Kaito 1102's meter shows ""full strength"" in its signal. And you can hear a HUGE difference too. The YB 400 does have a good speaker, clear and adequate for a radio its size, but it's not exceptional. I'd give the nod to the Kaito 1102. Since the Kaito 1102 is similarly sized and is fifty dollars cheaper than the YB400, I say it's a no brainer: Get the Kaito 1102.",4
"Great sensitivity and sound in a small radio.Very simple to operate.It's to be compared with the Sony 7600G, in choosing a portable, its chief competitor. You can't go wrong with either one.The YB400 audio  is much better than the Sony, and the operation is easier than the  Sony.The interference rejection however is better in the Sony because of  the Sony's synch detector, if interference of strong stations is a  consideration, or if ``selective fading,'' common on shortwave or twilight  AM broadcasting, where the carrier fades below the sidebands causing  distortion, is a problem.  This is also solved by synch detection.If  distance daytime AM listening is desired, the Sony with its fast AGC is  better than the YB400 with its slow AGC, because you can add a MW loop  (Select-a-tenna, Terk Loop, or Radio Shack MW loop) and tune it  successfully with a fast AGC.  It's difficult to tune with the YB400's slow  AGC, though sometimes you can turn the switch to local and disable the AGC  temporarily to do it.(Slow AGC gives you an edge in copying interfering  morse code stations, however, because the louder station won't modulate the  weaker one on the YB400, and it will on the Sony.)For strong stations,  pick the YB400 for the audio. For interference or AM distance listening  with a MW loop, pick the Sony.",5
"This radio is easy to use, and sounds great.  Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good.  You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators.  Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to.  With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved.  It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna.  It also has AM and FM reception.  FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality.  It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling.  This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't ""out grow"" it for a very long time.",5
This is one of the best portable radios out there.It has great shortwave reception! The F.M. and A.M. both have great sensitivity and selectivity; the ability to pull in weak stations next to strong ones. The only reason I don't give this radio 5 stars is because of the telescoping antenna. I've been through 5 radios because the antenna becomes lose and breaks after a long period of use. Other than that this would be a perfect radio.,4
"Hello radio lovers!  I have  a vast collection of radios and many many years of radio listening and purchasing experience  I can do accurate compares which many find helpful. When I purchased this radio I so wanted it to be great like the old days of Grundig . Its not bad , but I wouldn't go out of my way to reccommend it over others . The Sony sw7600gr and the Sangean ATS909 are much better buys . Here's why , first off the Grundig YB400pe is generally not made very well . The poor quality of the body , the antenna and the sound are obvious upon first look and listen . The tuner sensativity on FM is good but AM and SW are fair . The side band set up is ok , others are better . One draw back is that it takes 6 AA batteries while the others take 4 .This makes the radio very heavy for its size . True that the Sangean 909 and the Sony 7600 are a little more expensive but worth it . You are getting a more durable radio with a much better tuner and better sound . So I guess to sum it up its not that this radio is so bad its that the others in its class are so good.",3
"While I'm not exactly a shortwave hobbyist I've used shortwave radios on every one of my travels overseas. That being said the YB 400 PE is the best SW I've ever had. This Grundig brings a lot of features to the table such as digital tuning, forty presets, great capture of stations and above average sound. I've really enjoyed using the 400 and its great features.One complaint I had was that the manual that accompanies it does an inadequate job of explaining some of the functions and the pre-sets are all inclusive, that is it's forty pre-sets for all bands FM/SW/LW/MW rather than per band. But these are small things that shouldn't take away from the overall excellence of the radio.I'm getting ready to go on an extended trip to the third world and the Grundig YB 400PE is at the top of my packing list.",5
"Briefly, the FM and AM reception are very good for the Grundig YB 400PE radio. SW is decent and SSB is fair, at best. The controls and display for the Grundig are good, too: ergonomically, the choices made by Grundig were sound and better than much of the competition. Which is to say, the buttons and controls are easy to master in comparison to similar Kaito and Sony models. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR is a better unit, I have to say, but the audio on the Grundig is much preferable to the Sony. Overall, I would take the Sony, but the Grundig is a good portable radio and I would not be disappointed if I were on a desert island with just a Grundig Yacht Boy 400PE as company. Well done.",4
"Bought the camera mid-June, and by late June was covering a national convention requiring daily uploads to webpages.  Got rave reviews of the images shared.  The USB connection is easy and fast.  I found it handled  indoor shots without flash with outstanding resolution.It has also  produced some excellent outdoor shots, including some sky photography  (sunsets) that rival film versions.One does not need to employ the top  setting to produce extremely good pictures, maximizing the number of photos  on a single compact flash card.It came complete with a set of  rechargable batteries and charger - a nice feature.  And the Amazon price  is at least $100 less than any other source!This would be a perfect  camera for a person just starting into digital photography, who wants a  camera that looks, feels,  and acts like a familiar 35 mm point and shoot  and who has elementary knowledge and sense of computers.",5
"This was my first and only digital camera that I purchased as a display item will I was working at CompUSA. If I remember correctly, at the time this camera was over $300 but I got it for $50.I have no idea how old this camera was when I bought it, but despite that, it lasted an additional 3 1/2 years before it stopped working; the battery connections went bad. I took it apart to see if I could fix it, but to no avail.The 1.3 Megapixels was more than sufficent for me, it took crystal clear pictures everytime. I really enjoyed the LCD screen that showed in real time what the lens was looking at before you shot the picture. It also had a USB slot where you could easily tranfer the pictures to your PC. My only compaint about the camera was that the picture snapping was not instantaneous.This camera felt sturdy and built with quality materials. This camera had been dropped a few times, but it still functioned without any problems. I have taken thousands of pictures on this camera, not to mention the possible thousands that were taken before I came to own it, and I have been thourghly suprised with the durablity and quality of this camera.After my DC240 finally met its demise, I was dissapointed to find that Kodak no longer made cameras like this, instead they make these plastic, cheap looking, cheap feeling cameras that feel no way as sturdy as the DC series. I purchased a DX model a few months after this one died and took it back the next day because I was very dissapointed in the quality of the camera. To this day the DC240 has been my only digital camera and I haven't had one since. I will have to turn to EBAY to get something from the DC series, because unfortunately companies no longer make them like they used to.",4
"I really like mine. It takes good pictures. It was easy to get started with it. Do not try to buy a small camera bag for it because the lens cover will come off easily and you may accidentally turn it on when putting it into its bag.  I highly recommend the USB disk reader, makes things a lot easier. With that reader you may not need the battary charger unless you want a slide show on your TV. Note that the Kodak 280 is offered here... [it] is probably more value. But, you will have to buy accessories so [it] will become a bit more after its all done. I can't say too much about how the pics print because I have been using it exclusively for Internet images. I am having fun with mine.",4
"I bought the Kodak DC240 partially on a whim.  I had read reviews of the Kodak digital cameras and decided to check the price on Amazon -- which was  about right.  The camera came a few days before I went to a convention in  Philadelphia, giving me enough time to learn how to use the camera.The  pictures are wonderful, and my collegues were amazed that I could show them  the pictures immediately, or delete them if the shot was bad.  I also did a  few shots using the timer, which worked pretty well.  Following the  convention, I was able to put together a quick web site with the pictures,  a faster process than waiting for the film to be developed, then scanning  the pictures, then cropping, etc.Overall, a good combination of  features, ease of use, and quality pictures.",5
"This is the best camera I have seen for the price. It has tons of features. I would highly recommend getting a Compact Flash Card Reader, so you don't drain your batteries on the camera xfering. Also the Kodak Batteries are the best I have ever used. I would recommended getting the 2 hour rapid charger kit, you will get another set of batteries and be able to charge one set and use another.",5

"'Snagless' ..I thought is was a flat wound cable or something, but it's just a regular cable and overpriced at that.",2
"If you want solid, well constructed cable that you are never going to have to think about again then Belkin is for you.  I've never had one problem.",5
"If you're not used to working with wires and lengths, I'd suggest measuring something and testing it out on your setup. Even at 3 feet it seemed shorter than I thought it would be. Luckily my computer sits right next to my router so I didn't have issues there. It was great to move away from my previous wireless connection to a wired connect. Also makes it easier to troubleshoot the network when it's acting buggy.",5
I like belkin products and need a patch cable to run from my wireless modem to my laptop it fits just right and snaps in tight,4
Perfect for small jobs where you don't need all that extra cable. I got two just because they were so cheap.,5
"For the price, whats not to like? It works as well a more expensive ones and I haven't noticed any problems at all.",5
"Most of the review is copied and pasted from another review I did for a Belkin ethernet cable, this one being used in the same manner. This shorter one was exactly what I needed for the space in which it is being used.I don't know what else to really say about this, or any of the MANY Belkin cables I have bought from Amazon, except that they work very well for my requirements. This specific one is being used in my home theater system to connect a component to a switch box. It did not need to be pulled through any walls or stressed in any other way, but it's been fine for my use of it. Some people think they are not the best of quality but I have not ever had any go ""bad"" or break or not fit correctly. You *can* get cables even cheaper than these from Belkin, but I don't trust them... the Belkin cables here on Amazon are still FAR cheaper than what I have seen in stores, and I refuse to let instant gratification make me spend too much for something like this!",5
I needed a cable shorter than 6 feet. The 1' cable I had was too short. The snagless feature is  really useful since I have a tangled nest of cables under the desk - disconnecting and re-connecting will not be a problem.,4
"Good value for a LAN cable. Works as intended and the color is a breath of fresh air compared to the dull white or popping blue.Can't beat this deal. (if you can, be sure to let me know).",5
Needed a short cord to reduce clutter between my router and a switch.  Wanted a reliable brand name (Belkin) cord with quality connectors.  This one looks well built. Only shortcoming is that it is cat 5e (350 speed) vs cat 6 (500 speed).  Didn't see a 3 foot one in Cat 6 but the price for the Cat 5e was very fair.,4
This was bought after we bought 2 new laptops that needed wireless and my desktop isn't!  Just the right size for me to connect to the router!~,5
"As my modem sits right on top of my computer, a three foot cable was the best length for my needs so as to minimize cable clutter behind the computer. Connectors fit fine with reliable connections. Have cycled connectors numerous times in order to break the computer connection on web sites which cause browser to freeze so these can apparently handle cycling without reliability problems. This was important as I've had the plastic latch fail on other CAT5 cables from plugging / unplugging.",5
"I know it's a silly thing to say about a cable, but I love the color of it! It's difficult to get to the release latch to unplug the cable when it's hooked into the back of a 360, but otherwise it's just what I was looking for. It works fine for System Link, as long as your monitors are close enough together. :)",4
"I bought these Belkin cables. They are very nice quality. They seem heftier than a lot of the other cables. My system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the 1000 foot roll. He runs them to wall outlets, then uses the 7 foot or 14 foot snap in cable from the wall to the PC. That way, you don't have to buy a 40 dollar crimping tool.You can't solder these cables. They require a metal to metal contact, and lead-solder doesn't qualify. Also, it is critical to keep them spiraled, all the way up to the end. Even when attaching, instructions call for twisting them right up to the connection.Since the tech instructions, tell you to keep them down to under 350 feet, these cables, whether they are long or short, are in the right lengths.I know Amazon doesn't print prices in their reviews, but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down. The 50 foot roll was half again as much locally.These are the Category 5e cables. They give you a better return feed, which results in better overall performance. So insist on 5e instead of just 5. I initially bought some wall plates from (a nation wide electrical supply store) that were Category 3, then I returned those for the snap in option Category 5. Those were returned also, when I went to (a nation wide building supply center)... (of all places to go networking) and they had the complete Leviton line of 5e accessories.If I had to do it over again, I would still buy the Belkin 50 footers. I don't want to have a 500 foot roll of ethernet cable hanging around.These are tops. Gold plated connectors, Snag free ends, that protect that little lock in tab on the ends. You know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire, out of a wiring mess, and the little tab bends over backwards, never to work properly again. Well Belkin built twin arches over the sides to prevent just that. Way to go. Highly recommended, good stuff, for a good price.",5
"I have to give Belkin credit; the cable really does appear snagless. I used this short cable to connect an Apple TV directly to router. I try to avoid wireless when I can, but this cable had to fight for space among a clutter of cables through a small access panel in the back of the entertainment center. The texture of the cable's insulation, coupled with the cable's supple flexibility, made it easy to snake the cord through the tangled mess.The connection is solid and secure, and the locking tab on the connector has a shield to help prevent accidental disconnections. I have had no troubles with the quality of the connection, and the Apple TV transmits a high-definition signal every time.At this price, the cable is a bargain. For some reason, I've seen CAT 5 cable of this length sell for more than $25.00 in brick-and-mortar stores (and one time I had to pay the extortionate price because I was in a pinch).You can purchase this cable secure in the knowledge that you're going to get a quality product.",5
"it's a network cable, what can i say? it works lol. it would be nice if it had the little cover over the removal prong, but it's no big deal.",5
"This product works as advertised, I use it to connect my Apple time capsule to a Nother component and it did just fine",5
Initially I went to a chain box store and purchased a 3 foot CAT 5e. The price was $14.99.Then they pushed an extended warranty. Needless to say I returned it once this one arrived. Pay $1.66 or $14.99? That's a no brainer.,5
"Now, I'll admit I didn't strip it down and count how many twists per foot, but this blue three foot belkin CAT-5 cable is just about all you can expect from a functional blue 3ft piece of CAT-5 with molded plugs. Yup, shore is!",3
"it is a cable. It was nicely made, worked/works just fine. it wa slong enough to get where I needed.",5
"Good enough price, nice ends, good sheathing, not too stiff.",5
"I have these connected to my server, computers, switch and NAS server.  Nice short cables so I don't have so much mess around.  Seem like high quality, and they work.  What more can you ask from a cable?",5
"I find Belkin cables to be fine for their purpose.I'm not sure how you should rate the length of the cord, after all, you buy the length you need!The quality is fine and the price reasonable. (Wish I could say the same about their electronics though. - but that's a different set of reviews sometime.)",5
"Should have copied my comments from the other CAT 5e cable I endorsed.High quality product, fair price and reliability are the reasons I chose this product.",5
this cable was very well described came on time and I was very pleased with it would recommend it to anyone,3
"I use this to connect my cable box to my router so that I can have a stronger Wi-Fi connection in my room and it still works great! Remember, though, that it is a 3-foot cable, and be sure to keep that in mind when ordering. 3 feet was JUST enough for me, so just be careful!",5
"Good for short jobs, like connecting my nearby printer to my network switch, which is itself connected by a very long ethernet cable to the router down the hall in another room. Go go Belkin!",5
"Bought to connect DVR to wall plug in, ordered with 100 Ethernet cable, so price was a factor.  Saved $$ buying it online versus the store where it was $14.00.",5
"These short cables are perfect for use over the desk, without making a mess. I have a small switch where I connect two laptops and one Raspberry Pi, and long cables would make too much clutter. These cables work perfectly fine in my 100Mbit network, and should also work witn a Gigabit network (not tested). Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.",5
It's a short ethernet cable (only needed it to run between my router and a device practically next to it)It works like an ethernet cable should(Relatively) CheapThe snagfree design is better than I've seen on many others. It doesn't cover the tab itself making it hard to release like other cables. I found it quite neat that it just has guards on both sides of the tab that extend a bit past the end of it so that things can't (easily) snag on the tab and still be very easy to depress when you want to disconnect the cable.,5
"Great cable, Super cheap. I got it for less than $2 as an add on. Can't beat hardwiring game consoles.",5
This item was well made as one would expect. Performed well. Used to connect ethernet switch box to computer modem. This in turn connected my computer and several online entertainment consoles. Did the job.,5
I mostly use this in hotel rooms and it's been nice having the short cable. It's flexible and the ends make a nice connection. I think with normal use this cable will last me a long time.,4
This is a great product for connecting a switch and a router or modem. The connectors are very high quality.,5
Good qualtiy with well-designed connectors.  Extremely useful for short-disstance connections between router and other equipment.Purchased three cables.  Very satisfied!,5
It's a 3 foot cat 5 cable that lets my router talk to my switch.  No complaints.  Well I have one.  It doesn't clean or cook dinner.,5
"It is nice to have color coded cables in order to keep track of what goes where. I recently rewired my office and have now color-coded everything, and it is making things MUCH easier. It's nice to know the external network drive is purple, and the networked printer is yellow, etc...",4
"Im very happy with these cables, I used them for connecting my home theatre to the net via a switch I installed in my entertainment center. The wires are made of high quality materials and seem to be working great so far.",5
"Inexpensive, but seems to be of good quality. I was looking for a mix of different length cables, and these 3-footers fit the bill for some short patch cables into my ethernet switch, keeping all my devices happy! Good service from Amazon.",5
This ethernet cable is the perfect length to connect my surround sound receiver to my home network. It works perfectly and is much less expensive than any offerings from local stores.,5
Needed a short CAT5 cable to hook up a TV from a router and this fit the bill perfectly.  Cable is good quality and works perfectly fine.,5
"This cord is priced great and is of great quality; something that can be pretty much assured when your buying a Belkin product. I was looking for CAT 5e cables to replace my older cables and decided based on the reviews on Amazon and the price that this would be a great purchase. I don't regret it. The cable is of good quality and the cables-as advertised-are completely snagless; so much so, that it'll take you a couple seconds longer to unplug the cord from whatever peripheral or computer it's hooked into. This was actually frustrating for me when I was troubleshooting my router, but then became a plus when I realized how easily the other cable would come undone with just moderate tension on the cord. So, the snagless is great if you plan on leaving it hooked into one device for any extended length of time, but not so great if you plan on constantly hooking and unhooking it from your device (in this case, it's probably more convenient to get a ""snagging"" one. Otherwise known as...a regular RJ45 cable). I can imagine someone with a laptop using a wired internet connection fussing over this feature.  Oh yeah, the length of this cord is a beautiful thing. I got so tired of having all this excess cord hanging out the back of my devices that I was thrilled when I discovered this on Amazon. I had no idea they made the lengths of the cord this short, so, that was actually the deciding factor for me. I'm happy with this purchase.",5
"very nice set of wires, i love my purchase. better then the ones you buy in 99c. stores. i bought 5 of them.",5
"I really thought about buying a crimper, cable, and ends but after adding up the cost it was cheaper to just buy premade cables since I didn't need very many. This cable works fine for my needs.",5
"Does what I need it to, which is primarily to be a quick disconnect between a coupler and my PC when I don'twant to be online.",5
Used it for my other computer that was just sitting around. Works perfectly and seems very durable. Cable could be longer though.,5
needed a new patch cable and this one was a good buy and works like a charm.  No problems with this order.,5
Outside skin appears to be good.  Ends are solid and pretty well put together.  Color makes it distinguishable from other cables. Skin is obviously thin and would not work outdoors or exposed to weather.,5
"These 3ft cables are perfect for any networking task. Purchased these to replace the 25 foot Ethernet cables taking up all the space in my computer room. Using these nice short cables, I connected my routers and modem all together much more neatly than I had done using the longer cables.Bottom line: these work as they should. Been using them for about a year with absolutely no problems or complaints.",5
"Pro:It worked, It's blue and matches my Linksys routers, what more can you say about a cable? Came in a pretty package :-)Using in a Power Over Ethernet (POE) application.Cons:None",5
I've used this cable to connect a wifi router to a LAN net and even with regular unplugging and plugging for thunderstorms it has given me no trouble and always supplied a reliable connection.,5
my modem sits right on top of my desktop tower so i needed the smallest ethernet cable i could find and this was it!! superb!,5
Got several of these 3 foot RG45 Cat 5 patch cable to hook up the connections on my home network distribution panel.  I like these over the stiffer and inflexible yellow patch cables which were way too long.  These 3-footers are just the right length and much more flexible to route it around the 19&#34; distribution frame.,5
"this is a typical CAT5 cable - nothing special or fancy, but it works. it seems more durable than other crap ones I've used just in that the locking tab that holds it in the jack hasn't broken off after extensive use.",5
"My Ethernet wire broke. (the wire I used to connect my Verizon Modem to my Linksys Router) so I got this one and it works fine.  I would have liked them to specify ""Ethernet"" in the description cause I'm not familiar with the terminology and wasn't sure it was the same wire I had that needing replacing.  I finally looked up CAT5e on the web and found a site that called it an Ethernet wire so I came back here and bought it.",5
"Works as good as any cable you can buy in your local store, just at a much cheaper price.",5
This was exactly the length i needed from my modem to my router. It's been perfect since i received it. Internet hasn't disconnected once,5
"It's hard to gush about a cable, but this was the right amount of cable for a short run, and it worked fine, and the price was good. You have to order it as an add on with something else to make the shipping work.",4
Came on time and the cable works just fine.,5
"Nothing fancy here, just a well made product. The price is right and it works flawlessly. I will buy again",5
"With no wireless where I work, a cable is required to use the internet.This is the best buy I found.I had problems finding a 3-foot cable not wanting cable all over the desk.What I found was $10+ elsewhere, this is the best buy.Yes, it works without any problems.",5
"Whats blue- 3' long and filled with bits of wire- yeah, stupid joke but this thing works as advertisedYep",4
"this ended up being alot shorter than what i needed but i'm sure i will find some use for it in the future, very nice looking and well put together",5
This is a quick fix for a small cable problem.  Fast service to repair a cable connection that was broken.,5
"I needed a patch cable, and this one is great quality.  The price on Amazon is a fraction of what you will pay for this same item at Best Buy.",5
"Works just fine, nice blue color, and no trees in the rain forest were used in the manufacturing of the product. Not much else to say.",5
"I bought these a while ago just to bump up my overall purchase to the $25 (at the time) minimum to receive free shipping.  Not an exciting purchase, but functional as I bring up more devices between my patch panel and main switch.",5
"I'll make this short and fast much in the same way this cable works.  First and foremost:  it works and works well.  It may be only be 3 feet long and that is totally my fault but it fits exactly as I need it.  If I were lucid when I measured the location I would have chosen a longer cord and had a little extra but for what I needed at the time and now the length is perfect.  I have a virtual cable factory behind my electronics and when making any changes it is a nightmare because it seems as if everyone will get hung up at the connector but NOT this Belkin.  It is snagless and that is fantastic for the lazy or impatient.  Those elements alone would be worth buying this cable; however, when the value is added in this is a fantastic buy and I highly recommend it under any circumstances that work.",5
Its a cable.  It worked. It was long enough. Should of made my own but customer wanted blue. Two more words.,5
The product was what I expected and the price was the main reason I made the purchase.  I have never gotten a bad wird yet knock on wood.,4
"good quality, low price and the cables worked as expected.  that is all you can as for from a network cable.",5
I needed short cables to connect my home theater devices to a single Ethernet Cable by way of a ethernet &#34;switch-router&#34;. These cables fit the bill nicely and the quality is good. Local stores charge much more money for 6' cables which would be an expensivecable eyesore.,4
"This ethernet cable isn't long and it isn't fancy. However, it has a solid build quality and should last you for years. Great for running in between a router and a closet computer!",5
"The merchant got this CAT 5e cable to me quickly.  It's well built, doesn't kink, and I like blue.  Great.",5
"I bought this for my Onkyo receiver which required a direct connect Internet connection to receive the dozen or so channels available (XM, Pandora, Rhapsody, etc.).  It is of good construction and looking (color) and adds some fun to my otherwise mundane system layout.  Live it up and try come of the colors available.Since using daily I've not had a problem at all.  Arrived on time, well packaged, and as I ordered.  Solid good product.",4
"With a box of over 20 Cat 5 cables I have no idea why I bought this, I must have been drunk. Also claiming a 3-foot cord as Snagless is a bit overboard, but those Marketing Exec's really know what they are doing at Belkin.",3
Does what it's supposed to do.Thanks to everyone that takes the time to review products. It is a big help.,5
to reduce clutter behind the scene with colors to help color co-ordinate the herd gathering behind your electronic devices :),5
"Does the job nicely, cable is high quality and easy to route. Would buy a bunch more if I needed them.",5
"Well not alot to say on this. I bought this to connect my Roku box to my router since they are only about 2 feet apart.Its thin and not the best quality, but it works great. Snagless means that the ends are protected from being snapped offwhile feeding the cord through holes or openings in your desk or entertainment center. IT WORKS...and well thats what matters most. So my opinion, to run an ethernet cord to a short distance, you can't get a better value.",4
"I tried it on my laptop and it got stuck. I had to really tug, pull and work at it to get it out. I am not happy with it.",2
The cable length is what I was looking for and these are priced pretty more than well for what I needed.,5
"I bought a few of these along with some 25, 50, and 100 ft cables as part of my home surveillance project a while back.There's very little that could impress you about a 3ft cable, but I will say that Belkin, in general, provides great cat cable at extremely good prices.I'm a Belkin customer for life.",5
These are great for completing a distribution panel - long enough to reach from corner to corner but easy enough to coil if the connection is much closer.,5
"Ok, so it didn't disintegrate when I opened the package.  The twisty ties were twisty and tied.  The clips on both ends clipped properly. It did not break the first time I used it.  It didn't break when I had to unplug and re-plug it.  It fits most brands of cable management systems.  And data flows through it nicely.I love it.",5
"If you do wired networking, you will know that there is no such thing as too many patch cables. Usually the ones you have are much too long - hence my seeking & ordering these shorter cables. Certainly as good quality as any others; and WAY WAY cheaper than I have seen in any retail store!",5
"Sturdy, takes being stepped on etc. The color helps me differentiate one line from Another. Good connections. What else is there?",5
"It worked for me, but then I pulled it out of a box of other cables. The plastic tip broke off because it caught on something, the other end was already broken. The ends must be quite fragile.",4
Always Great to get the right size when a longer one is unnecessary and unmanageable. Belkin's Products are very consistent in both quality and price. They hit it all with this one. We have used several of these at work.,5
Best Cable I've ever purchased...doesn't get all tangled like others do.  Should last longer than others I've purchased.  Will buy more as need arises.,5
"We needed to hook two computers up to an ethernet switch box.  This short cable was just the right size for the computer which sat next to the switch box.  Very sturdy cable, and the clips on the ends look like they'll last a long time.",5
You can feel that this cable is made to last. It ahs durabel tips and they feel strong. This works well with all our needs.,5
It's a CAT-5e cable.  It's three feet long and black.  It worked exactly as described to connect my Kenwood D710 head unit to the main body of the radio.,5
"Needed a new one. Came brand new in packaging. Works great. Great buy for the money, great product, still use it today",5
Patch cord was well constructed. Perfect in patch panels and in home networks. Rubber coating looks to be very durable.,5
"Like the title suggests, why would any comsumer want to pay more for a product that does exactly the same thing?  Sure, there may exist purists that really believe a more expensive patch cable yields better signal delivery, but they'll have a hard time convincing me of an iota of difference.  Belkin is a reliable name that produces a reliable product at a highly competitive price.  I would buy, and will buy, these cables again and again.",5
This ethernet cable is a great value and works like a charm.  Had it for 2 years and have never had a problem with it.,5
"I replace my cables every few years, my cable was going out so I placed it with this, things are working so much better now",5
"Sped up my internet connection by simply buying this cord. I had had no idea that the cord itself could make connection slow, and this was a bargain compared to getting a new modem. Snagless, however, means that you'll never again get it wrapped as tightly as it appears in the photo. This thing is fairly stiff and it likes to stay straight. Just another in the coil of snakes on the back of the desk, but it's a very good cord.",5
Purchased this to connect a switch to a 4 port router for extra expandability. There is not much to say here other than if you are looking for a short cable to keep cords clean then look no further.,5
"Littly pricy, but a great cable.  You will plug this in and never get  another, so why not get it?  You may want a longer one though, I just use  this from my cable modem to my router.",4
"Does what it should, act as a patch cable for internet connection.  I only needed a short cable, and isnt much more expensive to purchase this ready made one than terminating my own wire.",4
"I needed only wee little cables to connect computers to switch and these are just the right size.  Handy to have the light blue, everything else is grey or black so I know which cable goes to what at a glance.",4
"It is well made, soft flexible material instead of cheesy hard plastic.  The length is about right for a patch cord.",5
"For ethernet cables, I don't need fancy smancy cables to get the job done. These are good and very inexpensive.",5
A good quality cable at an affordable price. It has worked well for me and I would purchase additional cables of this brand.,4
"its an ethernet cable. seems to work fine. have had no issues, and passes the signal like it needs to.",3
Good quality and you can't beat the price.  BestBuy gets about $25 for a similar cable.  I would buy it again.,5
These do exactly what you need them to do! What more can you ask for from patch cables? Great quality from Belkin.,5
"I have never bought a Belkin product i wasnt satisfied with. This is no exception. Not that i really give this cord any thought now that it's in use, but that is the point, isnt it? I guess the only other thing to say, is that being blue, it's easy to find in the mass of cords around my TV and computer area.",5
Not much to review here. Item was as advertised and worked without problem. The plugs have a guard over the lever which helps keep the snap tab from breaking off.,5
"Well constructed cable, it is very flexible making it easy to run where you want it.",5
"i recently ordered this ethernet cable due to mine being so old and long. this cable is the perfect size, works admirably and i received it within a week at a great price!thx u so much! as always i'll continue to shop online at amazon in the future!",5
"Nice looking cat 5 cable and the length is perfect for most devices. I wish they made several different colors instead of white and black, then you could trace what port and what device it powers.",5
This is a simple Cat 5 cord and inexpensive. It works great! I would recommend it. I have has no problems.,4
"I find it hard to say &#34;I love it&#34; about a network cable, but they are of fine quality, so they deserve a 5.  3 feet is pretty short - turns out, a little too short for my application - so be sure that's what you need.",5
It's a good cable. Not much you can say about a Ethernet cable. It works great.....high quality build.  I would recommend this cable to anyone.,5
"Hey it's an Ethernet cable,  These things either works or they don't. This one worked fine for me to connect to home router.",5
What you see is what you get. Just your average cat5e cable. Good for ethernet connections up to 3 feet.,5
"Great price for a genuine Belkin CAT5e patch cable! The packaging is minimal, which is a plus, since it's just a cable. I ordered a few. They all worked perfectly.",5
i need a small cable to run from my tv to my ZyXEL WAP3205 and this did the tick! seam to be high qty I tend to like Belkin products,5
"You'd think all ethernet cables are the same, but after installing thousands of pre-terminated cables in my profession, you get a good intuition of what's good and what's not.  These cables are certainly well made and reliable and an important part of any network.  You won't have any issues with this one so stock up and don't worry about connectivity issues.",5
Belkin 3-Foot RJ45 CAT 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable (Blue) worked just as it was I thought it would. Pagkaged well and arrived on time.,4
"Cables showed up exactly like I expected them.  Packaged neatly and correctly.  I honestly don't know what else to say, they are exactly as advertised.",5
This produce is well made is from a good company and works as stated very well.  This item came in a very short timne and was all I had expected,5
"Most people will tell you a cable is a cable.  After dealing with so many different brands, I have concluded that it is not true.  This cable is very easy to manage on a patch panel.  I am completely sold on Belkin cables.",5
ethernet cables work very  well with my xbox.they looks Great and i hope the color  of the items.thanks so much.,5
"Not a whole lot to say here.  They are good cables, good price, and arrived quickly.  I would recommend them to a friend.",5
"If there's one thing I dislike about Ethernet cords it's the price that some companies try to charge for them. I have, unfortunately, shelled out $20 for a 20 foot Ethernet in the past thinking it was the price I had to pay. Either this price is outrageous or the sellers online are crazy.After buying a switch for my college dorm room I needed an extra Ethernet cord. Since the switch box was about a foot from the Ethernet plug I needed a small length, and 3 feet seemed adequate.This light blue cord is exactly what I needed and is listed at an exceptional $2.75. With Amazon Prime this is like spending the quarters you find in your couch cushions.I always recommend buying Ethernet cords (or 90% of products) online. The deals are too good to pass up!",5
"This ethernet patch cable works great. I have no problems with the signal running through it. It seems like a solid, well constructed cable. The cable I got is as specified in the product description.",5
"I needed a cable to connect a new ethernet switch to a modem, and this fits the bill perfectly. Just as described.",5
i love this patch cable it works great and better than the after market i had speed is faster and better shipment was fast thank for a great product,5
What more can you ask for but a high quality low cost ethernet cable.  They work and I am happy.,5
Very fast service. exactly what I ordered..I am never disappointed with Belkin products.Will use Technology Galaxy again.Thank you..,5
I ordered these because most you find are 6 feet long and I don't want all that cable hanging everywhere because I have cats that will try to play with it and then all my equipment ends up on the floor.  Not now because since I found these on amazon they have not touched them.,5
What can I really say? It's a standard CAT-5 cable. It seems to be well constructed and it works. There is nothing more to say.,3
"it is a 3 foot Ethernet cord....it works, it's blue, it gets 5 stars. I have to type a few more words to give it a review.",5
This cable is what it is. I needed some extra cabling to attach a computer to my ethernet hub and it works fine.,4
"I ordered a longer version of this exact cable last year to connect my cable modem to my desktop computer. I was so impressed with the make and quality of it that when I bought a Valet router, I decided the cat 5 cable supplied with it was not up to the standard I expected. I bought the 3 foot one to connect my router to the modem. I really wasn't expecting much as far as improved performance, but I am keeping a full wifi signal on my phone now, while previously only having 2 of 3 bars showing up. Could be the shorter cord, could be better quality, I'm not really one to say since I'm no pro with these things, but it has improved my router's signal. One piece of advice, if you're using more than one get a different color. I wasn't thinking and prefer the blue cord, so I ended up with two blue cords that are going to the same product. Since I do occasionally plug my modem directly into the PC instead of through the router, I ended up having to color a black mark on the one cord so I know which is which. The snagless feature on these works really well and was the biggest concern I had with the cable that came with the router since I could already see the clip starting to wear from unplugging it and plugging. Wouldn't usually write a review for a cord, but this one has enough going for it that I think it deserves all the praise it can get.",5
"This cord works great and the length is just right for me. My only complaint is that the orange isn't quite as festive in person. I thought it would be more neon, but it's actually the dingy orange that you sometimes see on really long extension cords. Orange is my favorite color, so I paid a little extra for it, but I wish I had just gotten one of the cheaper ones.",4
"Good quality cable. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good, cheap patch cable. I bought them to replace some home made cables, and they work perfectly.",5
This wire does the trick for my portable WiFi router without having to lug around a long cable.  The three foot length is just right!,5
"I connect a long ethernet wire to TP-LINK TL-SF1005D 5-port 10/100Mbps Desktop Switch which inturn uses 3 of these belkin ethernet cables to connect all my devices and they work perfectly.I connect my TV, XONE and PS4 and all of them work at full speed.",5
"Plugs are not plated (full plastic), which can causes mass problems.They do their job as expected for the rest.",3
"I needed a few extra CAT 5e cables to hook up some devices to my home network.  I found these cables on here at what I thought was a ridiculous price, and though the price made me wonder would the things even work when I got then, I should never have worried.  They worked like a charm.For someone like me who isn't going to buy a roll of CAT cable at home depot and make my own network lines, these worked great.Highly recommend!",5
Not much to say about wire - it does the job.  We use this to connect an upstairs computer with a downstairs printer.,4
It's a piece of cat5 with snagless ends.  It is blue in color and approximately three feet in length.  Good for making short patch connections.  Nothing wrong with it at all I would purchase more if needed.,4
I saw the mixed reviews but went ahead and took a chance on this.  I am happy to report that it was in fact 3 feet and works perfectly connecting my modem to my computer.  The price was great the big box store wanted $25 for a 6 foot cord.This is a great value for a small space and it looks just like the picture.  I recommend the product.,5
"I just installed a network between my two home computers, and this cable did the job perfectly.  It worked just like it is supposed to, and the 50ft length gave me all the cable I needed, with plenty left in case I decide to re-arrange the desk locations.  WELL worth the $10.99 price.",5
"It works, it's snagless. Perhaps with some high end test equipment I could find a flaw, but none are visible by me. Five stars.",5
"Belkin is a classy company indeed. I am frequently plugging and unplugging my laptop from this cable and the tab that keeps the wire in the R-45 jack broke off after about 6 months of heavy use. Went to their website, put a claim in and they mailed me out a new one the next day, no questions asked. Sweet.UPDATE 8/08 Belkin now makes a50FT CAT6 Black Patch Cable Snagless RJ45M/RJ45Mthat is better made, transmits data faster and supports 1000 MBps networks and probably best of all is cheaper.",5
"I bought these Belkin cables. They are very nice quality. They seem heftier than a lot of the other cables. My system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the 1000 foot roll. He runs them to wall outlets, then uses the 7 foot or 14 foot snap in cable from the wall to the PC. That way, you don't have to buy a 40 dollar crimping tool.You can't solder these cables. They require a metal to metal contact, and lead-solder doesn't qualify. Also, it is critical to keep them spiraled, all the way up to the end. Even when attaching, instructions call for twisting them right up to the connection.Since the tech instructions, tell you to keep them down to under 350 feet, these cables, whether they are long or short, are in the right lengths.I know Amazon doesn't print prices in their reviews, but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down. The 50 foot roll was half again as much locally.These are the Category 5e cables. They give you a better return feed, which results in better overall performance. So insist on 5e instead of just 5. I initially bought some wall plates from Radio Shack that were Category 3, then I returned those for the snap in option Category 5. Those were returned also, when I went to Home Depot (of all places to go networking) and they had the complete Leviton line of 5e accessories.If I had to do it over again, I would still buy the Belkin 50 footers. I don't want to have a 500 foot roll of ethernet cable hanging around.These are tops. Gold plated connectors, Snag free ends, that protect that little lock in tab on the ends. You know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire, out of a wiring mess, and the little tab bends over backwards, never to work properly again. Well Belkin built twin arches over the sides to prevent just that. Way to go. Highly recommended, good stuff, for a good price.",5
"Using this cable to connect my PS3 to the router, and it's working fine. I don't know my upload or download speeds, but playing movies off Netflix and playing games online has been trouble free.",5
"We got one spare computer table in the room and just 20 minutes ago I set up everything and works perfectly! It is connected to our router in the living room and right now I am  playing the music player on our Xbox accessing my mp3 songs on this computer. So happy with this Belkin ethernet cable. Oh another thing, its wires aren't awkwardly bent like other cables after you remove it from its packaging...",5
The cable was just exactly the length I needed.  The no kink feature is really nice.  It worked very fine.,4
These where exactly what I needed for my blu-ray player. The price was great and could not be beat at any store that I looked at.,5
"If you just need to connect a router or switch, and don't want to bother about making your own cables, this is a great option. Certainly pricey for what it is, but the snagless design is very solid and you won't have to worry about bad cables, as these are all pre-checked for you.One small quibble is that the snagless housing makes for a big cable end, which could become problematic if you are plugging many cables into a small hub. Otherwise, great.",5
"Cable is high quality, was shipped on time and packaged well.  I have used cheaper cables but they are not as well-made and durable as this Belkin cable.",5
Works fine. No problems with any of the connectors. Packaging was fine when I received it. Overall no problems and works to standard.,3
"There's not much to say.  This cable does the job intended and works just fine. Considering the price, it's a great buy!",5
ita a cable it does what it supposed to do and does it good been doing it for a while now and hope keeps on doing seems like it like what its doing,5
"While it seems silly to sit and glorify the merits of a cable, the Belkin series of cables are truly great. I have a number of varieties of them, and they are all excellent - well made, work great, and the snagless aspect actually is qite good. Good connectors that won't break soon, too.",5
I needed an extension that was not wireless so that I could reduce the buffering in downloading and watching movies and this does the job adequately.,4
I use it to run to my router and keep my family happy haha thank you for selling this item to me,5
"I bought this to connect another PC to the router and this cable made installation easy. Was able to run it from the router, through a floor hole, across the basement, and up through a hole near the additional PC with no kinks, twists, snags or curls. The PVC jacket is solid and thick for excellent protection and yet the cable remains flexible so I was able to bend it through some pretty tight spaces.Big plus: the strain relief on the RJ-45 plug helps protect the locking tab from snapping off. The plugs fit into the jacks with barely any wiggle so it makes solid contact. (And I've had some bad experiences with cheapo ill-fitting RJ-45 plugs from other sources. I'm looking at you, Radio Shack.)I like this cable and highly recommend it.",5
"Great quality cable, I wouldn't buy anything of a lesser quality and it has the stubs on the end to protect the connector that often breaks off....",5
I bought it to hook up my x-box 360 to my computer. It works great and i did not have to spend $100.00 on a wireless.,5
This product works flawlessly and provides a great signal for my extended network system. I highly recommend this cable.,5
I snaked it through a wall.  The ends held up just fine.  My media PC has excellent internet connection through FIOS.,5
"What can I say...it is cable. It is long, it is blue, it does its job and the price was right..",5
"I'd not going to go nuts here - I mean, it's just a cable. But 50ft of CAT5 at the oxymoronic 'Best Buy' would mean unloading your wallet, so $12 is a reasonable price and the cable has been working fine ever since.",5
"This is just what it says it is. A good, moderate cost cable for joining parts of an ethernet network. The connectors are large enough to grasp easily and they are snag proof as you pull them around furniture, etc.",5
"I bought this ethernet cord for my home network and it has worked flawlessly. Not much else I can say...it works as you would expect it to, and the price is great.",5
"Works great, but I'm not too sure what snagless molded patch means, but definitely able to hook my desktop into my router! I wish they had black though...",5
"I wanted to buy a good cable, not a cheap one and this one seems to be made well and is working good.",5
"Very sturdy, Just what I needed since my PC does not like to &#34;go wireless&#34; all the time. I just keep it plugged in with this chord and all is good. And when my MAC has issues with wireless, I can give it a turn.",5
I ordered both the Belkin 25 ft CAT 5e and the Belkin 50 ft. CAT 5e cables since I was not sure if the 25 ft cable would be long enough --- as it turned out the 25 ft cable was just what I needed so I did not use the 50 ft. cable.  The 25 ft cable comes in Belkin packaging and markings but (like other reviewers stated) the 50 ft. cable comes in a plastic bag that says made in China and there is no indication that the cable is a Belkin.I gave this 2 stars because it does not appear to be a Belkin product --- I would give the 25 ft. cable 5 stars.,2
"And now I have one.  I tested it, tied to multiple connectors back to the source and it works perfectly, with no delays, etc.",4
Used this to hook up wired router for 2nd computer.  It is a quality product.,5
"50ft for $9!!  What else needs to be said?This cable is every bit as good as the $50 bundles you'll see at Office Depot.  I bought about 7 of these and every one of them works great.  I have my home security system wired up on this particular cable.Its a great buy, and I'm a Belkin customer for life now.",5
"The cable worked, was able to negotiate a gigabit connection as expected.  There's not much more to say. . .",5
"priced right and worked flawlessly, i recommend this item for home networking and will use again in the future.",5
"This cable was received neatly coiled with twist-ties in a retail package. The connectors, which are already applied, will not loosen over time like manually pinned out cables will have a special design to protect the security clip from breaking off. This allows the RJ45 connectors to fit firmly in place and not fall out of the network port.Belkin is a recognized brand for premium cables. Even though this is a name brand cable, the price was comparable to other similar cables making this purchase a clear best choice.",5
It's very blue and does not snag even if you try.  I really like how blue it is and it also works well.,5
"This cable says BELKIN on the box, but the protective sheathing is of a poor quality.  50 feet is a long length, and if the quality is poor, you can expect crimping, snaging, twisting, and a mangled mess.  I bought this cable anyway.  I used the cable for three weeks.  I removed the cable after three weeks.  JUNK AFTER THREE WEEKS.All those who say 5-star -- maybe they only used it for a day.  After they got paid for writing a glowing review, they junked it after 1 week. Plan to junk yours too. Hey, it is only your hard earned money. So what?I cannot tell you how much it HURTS ME to write such a poor review.  Dam you, BELKIN.",2
"Good product and it does the job.... and great price.....  seems to be very well made, just as most all Belkin products are.",4
"I have been using Belkin Cat5 cables for a long time.They come with a stamp and specs on the wire and the connectors have a Belkin logo embedded in them.The one i received does not have the Belkin name anywhere on the wire and the connectors.Sure its a fake.If i had to buy any Cat5e i could have spent only $10 including shipping.May be this fake cable works good, but the seller should not deceive people by saying its a Belkin cable.Buyer beware.",1
I opted for this one after reading reviews of some of the other cables made by other manufacturers. It is the cable ends that are usually of concern. The Belkin cables are fine. The ends are very well made and snap into their sockets nicely. I have used it to hardwire an internet streaming box to my router. It is functioning just fine.,5
"I am using several Belkin patch cables along with this one.  They all work as advertised, have a good design on the connectors and come with a lifetime warranty...",5
"Gotta put in 20 words,,  so what can I say, it is a pre made item, made by a great cable maker, so this thing will work great and it was a great price,  usually stores are out to kill you on price so this fit the bill to connect two rooms together on my network.",5
Works perfectly. Great value. Connecting internet modem to TV in living room via basement in order to use Netflix/Pandora. Blue makes it easy to recognize what it is if we ever have to distinquish it from other lines.,5
"Yup... They connect my cable modem to my router, and my router to my computers. They transmit data back and forth. So far they have failed to burst into flames or snap off and poke me in the eye. So go patch cables (yay).",5
"This 50ft cable is flawless, snagless, no more kinks in the cable.The connectors are nice and soft and I love the blue color.This cable works like a charm and well worth the price at 50ft length.Highly recommended - cheaper than Radio Shack!",5
"I needed a cable to go across my house, and this one did that job fine. I was really afraid I would have to pay a lot of money for a 50' cable, but this cable proved me wrong. It is not expensive(...). The snagless connectors were very useful when I was dragging the wire under my floors (though some tape probably could have done the job). I have not noticed any loss in performance because of this cable.",5
Cable worked great will buy again when i need another cable.  Very durable and works like it should.Would recommend if you need a DSL cable,5
"Received these (2) quickly, packed well in BELKIN packaging. Snaked thes thru walls and got a tight connection with nice signal strength. I needed the 50'. Glad that I didn't go with my first assessment of 25&#34;All was right with the ordering, packaging and delivery.Ran from DSL router to computer and ROKU.",5
"This cable is such a great price, ....that ....that alone is a great reason to buy it........ It helped me extend the distance of my signal, without the cost of having to buy a signal booster",5
have been using this cable for 3 months now with zero problems. ive got it running thru my apartment because our router is in my roommate's room. a quality cable that is reliable and dependable! i love it!,5
Prompt delivery. The extension cord allows me the extra length I sometimes need when I must be away from my desk while teaching and using my ipad.,5
"I used this for a server I have running in a corner of the room away from my PC.  I plugged this into one monitor port, and now I don't have to use a finicky remote control software to access the PC.  The cable is good quality and provides a clear image of the screen.",5
Great price and it did exactly what I needed it to do. If you need to make your cord stretch after rearranging some furniture this works fantastic.,5
I use this to have an extra monitor closer to my ham shack.  It does the job but the screws don't reach the nuts so I only could plug the cord in and could not screw it in place.,3
ordered a few of these they work great.  Perform like the newest cables with out the cost.  A true buy.,5
"This was not the right cable i needed, so cannot give it a glowing report. Returned it and bought the right HDMI cable.",5
My projector Universal port adapter was only 2 ft long. This was an excellent addition. Now my computer does not have to sit so close to the projector.,5
I need a Male/Female cable to use with a VGA extender. I didn't realize until I received the cable that the fastening posts actually prevented the cable from connecting because any VGA outlet would not accommodate that. I decided to take my chances with a hack saw and successfully (and easily) removed the posts from the female end. The posts are only needed if using as an actual extension to prevent the cables from being pulled apart. It worked great for my application.,5
"??? In this review I was asked to rate 1-5 stars on this product's ease of use and sound quality - i have no idea why, as this is strictly a visual product.Anyway - I use this male to female VGA monitor extension cable to extend another 15' VGA cable which connects my laptop to my 46"" LCD TV. I would say I am very discerning when it comes to assessing audio/video quality and still feel the picture is nearly PERFECT. It does what it is supposed to, without any detectable degrading to the image quality or ""noise."" The build feels solid and at the same time, not too rigid. I am very happy with this product.*UPDATE:This and the other cable I bought at the same time, 2.5 years ago, both seem to be working well. Neither has seen heavy abuse, so I can't attest to it's road-worthiness, but in my home it still carries a strong, clear signal!",5
"The screws to tighten the plug feel cheap, but the cable works just fine. I'm using it for an old 17&#34; monitor and the picture looks just dandy.",5
Belkin isn't high in terms of consumer name recognition - but they produce a pretty wide range of products.  Cables to Routers.  I've never been disappointed in any of their products which deliver to value pretty dependably.  This cable is another one of those products.  A simple product (VGA Extension Cord) - but it needs to work reliably.  This cable was nearly the least expensive one available - and it works well / as expected with higher resolution.  I'd buy as many more as needed without any regret or remorse.,5
"I was looking for an extension for my 42""tv/monitor in the living room when i found this one i have bougth belkin products before and have had good luck with them this was a very good buy for the price better than going to the retail stores and buying there.",5
Purchased to use second monitor on my PC. Configuration of my setup required a longer VGA cable. Does the job perfectly!,5
"The first two times I plugged this into my projector, it took a couple times unplugging and replugging to get it connected.  Now I can't get it to work at all.  Unfortunately, I had it over a month before I tested it, so now I can't return it.",1
"If you have to run a legacy DOS program, it's getting progressively harder to find these things.There's also the issue of a maximum length for a functional parallel cable before things start malfunctioning.This one works just fine, and is inexpensive, as well.(So how much more can one rave about a rather intentionally mundane object?)",5
"With my setup I have my printer and a zip drive running off the same cable, and since I bought this Belkin cable I havent had any problems. It is also very easy to screw and un-screw onto the computer as it has  different knobs than the standard printer cable.",5
This extra long (25') cable enabled me to relocate my printer to a more covenient location in my home office.,5
"-- A cost-effective cable!  I needed to connect my ancient (but under-used) HP Laser Jet-II printer to my ""modern"" computers (that still have a parallel port).  I'd considered using a USB-to-parallel cord, or a USB-to-parallel adapter (converter), but som",5
This item is perfect for those of you who still have older HP workhorse laser printers. Thick construction and super long cable.,5
"Worked perfectly to run from a desk, around a wall to an Oki dot-matrix impact printer. Not a single problem. Typical great Belkin quality.",5
"Paying (little cash), I was not expecting a great deal of volume from this speakers. Consider this, some cheap non amplified speakers cost near $15 dollars and for double that price, you would expect about double the quality. Well, let me tell you, this baby more than quad-triples the sound of those speakers.The Creative labs PC WORKS 1000 system comes complete with the 2 satelitte cubes, the subwoofer, power adapter, audio inputer cable, mounting stands, velcro attachments and screws. Installation was very easy, just plug the speakers in the back of the sub, plug in the power adapter in the power source and the audio cable in the sub and the source.The included manual is quite small but is adequate enough to help you set up and get the system running. They have recommendations on placement and volume. I plugged my system into a discman first. When I first turned it on I was amazed at the power of the bass. The OOMPHS really shocked me.Concerning the volume, this is one of the problems I have with the system. First off, the volume is somewhat hard to find the appropriate setting. (There is a bass adjustmant on the sub and a volume control on the audio cable) Finding a balance in bass and treble is quite hard. When the bass level is at 50% (as set when you first get the system), the bass tends to overpower the treble at lower volumes while the treble overpowers the bass at high volumes. Solving this problems involves alot of tweaking and depends on the type of music you listen to.My second problem with this system is the supplied velcro strips. These were supposed to be used to mount to a wall. I was obviously skeptical at the concept but I tried it anyway. About 3 days after mounting them to the wall, on one of the speakers, the velcro pad unstuck from the speaker so the speaker fell. After re-sticking it, almost a day later, the velcro pad stuck to the wall unstuck so the other speaker fell. After this happened, it is obvious that the actual sticking surface which attaches to the wall/speaker is too weak, not the velcro. If you decide to use the velcro, let the pads stick to the surfaces for atleast 2 days before mounting the speaker to the wall.Those 2 problems are my only ones, other than that the volume is excellent. You will be suprised about the amount of volume you can get from this system. Its hard to explain,...hear the sound, you will be amazed.....In conclusion, if you think about it, the cost of these speakers warrant it to be a typical speaker system for any computer and can easily be used for a small home theatre system. The speakers are magnetically shielded so you can mount them to your monitor. If you got extra cash and you want neighbours 2 or 3 houses down the road to hear you, consider pumping out that cash for a more expensive system. But for regular people like me on a budget, this system is an excellent solution for any sound need.",4
"Pros: low price, decent sound, unobtrusive, easy to set up.  Unlike some 3 or 5-piece systems, the PC Works bass unit is shielded, in case you ever need to put it close to your monitor.Cons: though it seems a bit silly  to complain that a $50 set of speakers offers less than perfect sound  reproduction -- heck, I've spent far more than that on speaker wire -- the  &quot;subwoofer&quot; in this set is not really a subwoofer at all.  It's a  woofer, and exhibits a rather uneven frequency response.  Still, the sound  is fine for games and most Internet music content.As long as you  aren't expecting them to sound like a good pair of living room speakers --  don't believe the hype on the box -- you probably won't be disappointed.",4
"I have been using it on my PC for 2 years now. This made-in-China product proved to be very reliable.  It sounds great with games and CD audio.  It sounds A LOT better than those mini 2 speakers. For just $40, I don't see why we should use the cheapy mini speakers.  My only complain is the volume distortion.  If I push the volume higher than 5 using the build-in volume control, the speakers starts to have some background noise.",4
"Excellent speaker system for the price. Extraordinary sound, and great Bass. Fully recomended to anyone shopping for computer speakers.",5
"Let me preface this review: These speakers are not for the audiophile. If you want high end sound, completely distortion free at full volume, with a treble that can call in the dogs from a mile away and a bass that can rattle cracks in your house's foundation these are NOT the speakers for you.But if you don't want to spend a lot of money and you still want reasonable quality, these speakers are a good buy. Given the price of these speakers, I must say I was amazed at the sheer clarity of the sound. I tested them with my car CD player and they played everything from classical Beethoven to classic rock with alaming precision. They worked equally well on my computer for CDs, MP3s, and DVDs. The bass was separately adjustable--a plus at this price range--and the apparatus was easy to set up.I did not experience audible hiss that was noted by some of the reviewers, but at higher end of the volume setting the higher sounds tended to fray and the bass became a little muddy. No matter. This is not the speaker set up for a large room or a home theater. These are personal speakers that will function best in a small room or office and they pack more than enough punch for this venue.My five star rating reflects the quality of the product given its price.  I have listened to other speakers by Boston Acoustics, Altec Lansing, and Yamaha that were bought for almost double this price that did not sound as good as these. Once again, this is not audiophile sound, but who can expect that in this price range?  I highly recommend them for the basic user who does not want to pay a premium for premium sound.",5
"I bought these for the price and really did get more than what I paid for.  If you're shooting for looks, you won't get it.  These speakers are ugly and i hate the external volume control...makes for too many wires running  around if your like me and have ethernet cables and a bazillion extension  cords already.  As far as sound goes I thought they were far more than  serviceable.  If you really like to turn it up I would recommend something  a little more powerful, but if you have them in a smaller room and such  they'll do great.  Great price, nice sound, ugly packaging, but a definite  recommendation overall.",4
"...not very loud, and the sub tends to get boomy. other than that, best sound for the money(still is). perfect &quot;hi-fi&quot; for a student living in a dorm...took it to a friend's home with a portable cd player. my friend laughed at my portable gimmicky stereo at first. they weren't laughing anymore when they heard it playing.",4
"these speakers are great, great sound from a cheap sound card, full sound and power.",5
"The Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks speaker system was designed by Audio Hall of Fame member Henry Kloss and made in partnership with Creative Labs, the company that also manufactures Soundblaster audio cards for PC's. Simply put, this compact computer speaker system is an absolute dynamo!! It consists of two 3-inch X 3-inch X 3-inch satellite cubes, a 9-inch X 6-inch X 6-inch subwoofer unit, and a wired remote volume control unit. The subwoofer is the central unit in the system. In addition to pumping out a deep, mellifluous, natural sounding bass into the room, it provides amplification for the satellites.It doesn't take  long at all to get the Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks speaker system set up and running. Here's all you have to do:* Connect one of the volume controller's 6-foot leads to the computer's &quot;audio out&quot; port, and the other lead to the subwoofer.* Connect each satellite's 10-foot lead to the subwoofer.* Plug the subwoofer into household current.* As the instruction manual points out, the human ear can't distinguish the location of bass frequencies; so subwoofer placement is not critical. I suggest placing it on or near the floor on a low-lying shelf.  For best results, don't  place anything within 4 inches directly in front of the subwoofer.After setting up my Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks speakers, I really put them through their paces.  I test drove them with music as diverse as Beethoven's &quot;Spring&quot; violin sonata and &quot;The Best of the Guess Who.&quot;  I played a variety of computer games.  And, I watched the movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; in my computer's DVD player.  In all cases, The sound from these little Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks gems was simply magnificent... at all times, crisp, clear, well balanced, and natural.  Never  any distortion, fuzziness, or clipping, regardless of how loud I set the volume.I &quot;discovered&quot; Cambridge SoundWorks speaker systems a couple  years ago, when I bought an &quot;Ensemble IV&quot; satellite/subwoofer system for my stereo. When I first bought it, I was amazed at the sound quality that emanated from that miniature dynamo; two years later I'm still amazed.The Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks is as good as my &quot;Ensemble IV&quot; system; in fact, I rate it as the best computer speaker system I've ever heard. Considering its very inexpensive price tag, it also a system that packs a huge &quot;bang for the buck&quot; for consumers.So, if you're looking for a new computer speaker system that will bring your games, music, and movies alive, look no farther that Cambridge SoundWorks PCWorks. Go ahead... buy `em and set `em up... then kick back and enjoy the music!!",5
"I'm no audiophile.  Increasingly, my music is stored in the form of 160  kHz mp3's so I can take it with me or put it in very large playlists on my  computer.  That implies some small amount of loss of sound quality.  I'm  the kind of guy who's happy to live with that.That having been said,  these speakers are ideal for the purpose.  After side-by-side comparing  them at a store with several other more mainstream brands, I was impressed  at the amount of what those audiophile glossies call 'presence', especially  at the low volumes appropriate for apartment dwelling.  Beat the Altec and  Labtec speakers hollow - dunno why, particularly.  A Bose system was a  little better - and about 10 times the price.The large 'subwoofer' only  gets frequencies that your brain's spatial localization system (mediated by  the lateral lemniscus -&gt; superior olivary nucleus pathways, if there are  any neuroscientists reading this) isn't equipped to deal with.  So set it  under your desk, put the little 2 inch cubes on your desk (or hang em from  something with the included 2-sided tape, each weighs about an oz.) and get  ready for great sound at a great price!  I originally bought a set for my  computer but went ahead and bought extra sets for every room in my home,  including the bathroom, so I can have 24-hour music now if I want.  The  price is right to do that!",5
Very high level of noise three pixels on all the time. Otherwise it's about as good as a low quality surveillance cam. I don't know  what the other reviewers are used to but they need to look around. For the price it's OK in good light forget it when the light begins to fade. The software is somewhat deficient too. when I tried to do a video capture it froze up.I would not recommend this to anyone,2
"This is an incredible camera, especially in regard to its low-light capabilities. I used mine for years, but as Windows OS versions changed, the camera became less and less cooperative with the PC, and with Windows 7 finally stopped working completely. (It didn't do that well with XP, either).So, if you're running an OS older than XP, you can't go wrong with this camera; especially at this price!",5
"These webcams are excellent and it is a shame that they no longer make these web cams anymore... You will be able to buy them from Auction sites (e.g., Ebay) or here at Amazon... but most likely, you will have to search endlessly for the Drivers of the item!  When you find the Drivers that you need to run this item... You will find an excellent, high quality webcam and worth the price!  I use webcams for a living (conference calls..etc...) and own top-of-the-line video conferencing cameras... and for the price of these cameras... they are worth it!",5
"As expected with any CCD, mine got a hospot burned into the image where the sun hit the camera at the same point every afternoon (I have it watching my front pasture). I have since adjusted the position.ALSO: A lot of the software included is actually DEMO versions and if you want to use them for more than just play you either have to go buy the full version or hack around your setup to work aroung the limits of the demo version (this seems to be a common, but still misleading, way all the cam manufactures bundle the software with their webcams.",3
"Pros: It's actually a relabled Vicam, which has been favorably reviewed in the past.  Excellent low light performance.  Detachable USB cable is easily replaced with a longer one.  Comes with an unregistered copy of webcam32  which is an excellent program for putting your camera on the web.Cons:  Apparently 3com now owns the product, so expect no driver updates and no  useful customer support.",4
"If you need a camera that takes higher quality, and higher resolution photos in all kinds of light, you will need this camera.  The 3Com HomeConnect has remarkable low-light capability.  I use it as a &quot;weather cam.&quot;  It is pointed out the window of my office in Edinburgh, Indiana where it adapts well to everything from bright sunlight to ambient street lighting at night.  Unlike most Webcams, this one features a resolution as high as 640x480.  I also like the long, detachable USB cord.  Another plus is the easy setup  utility.  Basically, all you do is put the CD in the drive and it tells you  onscreen what to do next.  It's so simple!  Just don't plug the camera into  the USB port before the program instructs you to do so.  It's not the least  expensive camera on the market, but the extra price gets you a much better  camera than the average Webcam.",5
"Although it says that the camera is not Windows certified when it is being stalled, I have no problem whatsoever. I got the latest driver from vividcommunications.com.I have no idea why some people report low-light problem or color problems but this camera is the best that I've used in term of clarity and low-light capability.  I think once you figure out how to set this camera up, you'd enjoy this camera.With interchangable lenses, the camera can cover a wide range of angles.As for mounting, I went to Best Buy and got a pair of speaker wall mounts for about $$, which provides all the adjustment angles you'd need.  You only need one mount for each camera but have to buy them in pairs, as they are made for speakers.Good luck to those who are getting a webcam.  If you need more info on the mount, just contact me.",5
"I think peoples' expectations of web cams are so low that they rate things at 4 or 5 stars too easily.This camera is lousy, and isn't worth $90.The details:Installation:GOOD.  Installed on a Win2k Pro SP4.  No problem at all.COLOR: Terrible.  No matter how you set the controls, use auto or manual, or mess with the settings, the green/red/blue color rendition is always awful.  Color shades are all wrong - either too vivid, too washed out, too green, to intense, etc.FRAME RATE: Terrible.  There are 3 settings for picture quality vs frame rate.  On &quot;high&quot; quality, you get a nice smooth picture with so-so color, and a frame rate of 7 fps (I measured it).  On medium, the picture is very grainy, so you can turn down the sharpness, which helps &quot;somewhat&quot; - frame rate is now 15 fps.  On &quot;low&quot;, the picture is downright awful, with grain, and jagged lines, and the frame rate is still only about 19 fps.It cannot do 30 fps, nowhere near it, not at 160x120, 176x144, 320x240.  Forget it.CPU: Good.  Uses about the same as other good webcams I've tried --- about 20% of a PIII 900 MHz to capture 320x240 at 15 fps.LIGHT SENSITIVITY: Good.  The picture quality does not degrade, and the frame rate doesn't drop in low light, and the picture is plenty bright enough.  Unfortunately, the picture is NEVER good, and the frame rate is never good, so this is of little value.Go try a Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000 or an Intel CS430 and you'll see what a good web cam is capable of.",2
"Far better resolution and optical quality than more recent webcams, these 3Com computer video cameras are still useful many years after being discontinued. At the time, they were available with interchangeable focal length lenses as well. Worth seeking out.",5
"I was nervous buying this camera as I had read horror stories of how people couldn't get to install this on their computers. But I was hooked to this camera's response to low light and went ahead and bought it. I made  sure I stuck to the installation sequence (software tests first, installs  drivers and then you hook up the camera on reboot) and it worked!  Not only  that this is a twain compatible device and I got it to work smoothly with  Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and Premier 5.0. This deal is worth the risk. Picture  and video quality is really good and even better than the ones that come  out of the SGI video cameras (supposedly the graphics powerhorses).",5
"I bought this camera after reading several reviews here, on CNET, and also by visiting webcam sites that use this particular camera.  I heeded the advice of reviewers to go directly to 3com's site to download the latest drivers for this, and installed those first instead of using the CD-ROM.  No problems on a Micron, 450MHz, 96 RAM, WIN 98 machine.  I installed the software no prob, BUT be forewarned the Webcam32 software (to create your own webcam on the internet) included is *not* registered!  You will have to pay for it if you plan to use it for more than an hour.  I did pay, just because I wanted this specifically for a webcam.  I'm not that crazy about the Webcam32 software though - it feels quite amateurish.  Alas, it's the only thing I have, so I will stick with it.  Apparently many other webcam creators like it.  The low light performance of this camera is excellent.  It self adjusts to many light situations.  Even the largest image resolution is very clear. I previously had a Logitech QuickCam Web USB Camera, but the image was quite grainy on that, and it was hard to get anything clear in a dark situation.  But it's user friendliness was excellent.  And it had a convenient FREE membership to spotlife.com, that hooked it's software into Logitech's, which did all the work for you to send a webcam image to their site. (with a quick refresh time as well).  I only wish this 3com camera had something as useful and easy software-wise. Also no problems with angling of the camera in the direction you want, as I read in another review.  Perhaps I got an improved version?  The cable doesn't weigh it down at all, and it sticks in the position you put it.  3com has discontinued this camera, so get it while you can for good quality!  This camera is quite small unlike the photos.  If you are just starting out, you might want to consider another cam for ease of use.",4
"Very unhappy with this. Setup was a breeze contrary to much I have read but the picture quality is horrible because this camera is very used and very beat up. Upon first connect the images were a total washed out blur. I removed to lens to clean it all and it looked like milk or oil had been spilled all over this camera in the past. After much cleaning the images are now almost recognizable. Still very poor, I can't believe someone would sell a product, new or used, in this poor condition. Zero stars if I could. My $19 Labtec cam takes far better pictures. The 3Com HomeConnect might be good, I don't know because the one I got is in such bad shape.",1
"&#34;Great camera. But it is made for Widows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000. The furnished drivers are for those systems only, and will not work with later operating systems. Also, I cannot locate any Vista or Win7 drivers for the camera. Too bad !The Mac does not even recognize that the camera is connected.",3
"Palm comes with a stylus.  If you lose it then buy this, otherwise it's a waste.  And by the way, if you have long fingernails you can use that to input into your Palm when you're too lazy to take the stylus out",3
"I bought these babies the same day that i bought my Vx. I thought that it would have been a good investment counsidering how small the styli are. Considering my penchant for misplacing things, particularly pens, i thought i should go ahead and get them. For some strange reason, I've only lost one in 6 months and that was the one that came with the unit. In that aspect one pack of these replacement stylus should last you a while.However if you can get other replacement styli that can fit the silo i suggest you go that way. The replacement styli dont seem to fit the silo as well as the original one. It doesnt fit right. After a little investigation i found that the plastic tip (the part that can unscrew) is slightly larger in circumference then the original stylus. Thats why it seems a little tight when you take the it out and put it back. Why this is, i have no clue but it's really annoying.For anything else you can get these babies to preserve the continuity of the unit, otherwise i recommend you find another replacement stylus that can fit the silo.Personally though i dont use the stylus. I recommend you go get one of those multi-pens that have a stylus, pen and pencil all in one. All serious Palm users use one of these instruments simply because any type of prolong use of the stock stylus will certainly give you cramps, at the very least. Its like writing with a toothpick. If you anticipate that your going to be scribling on your palm a lot go get a multipen. Cross makes a good one, Lamy and Rotring also makes excellent multipens. Personally i use a Rotring black matte Trio-pen. It carries a blue pen, stylus and pencil. Its a great size, weight and looks incredibly cool.Again if you anticipate scribling alot on your palm, i strongly recommend getting a multi-pen. However if you dont think you will be the stock stylus will suffice.",3
"High-quality stylus, 3 of them even! They even seem better than the one that was actually included with my Palm Pilot. A stylus is an easy thing to misplace, lose, just like a pen, so its great to have a few in your briefcase or purse!",5
The stylus fits perfectly in my antiquated palm pilot and I really like the weight of the stylus.  My pda might be old but it works for me.  Thank you very much!,5
"Your Palm V probably came with two -- one metal with plastic ends and a hidden pin to reset your palm, and one all plastic.  These are exact replacements for the metal stylus that came with your Palm.  That's about  it!For the price it seemed like a good idea to have them around just in  case.  You can also keep a spare in each car, or whatever.",5
"This stylus's tip seems to be of a harder plastic than that of the Palm III's (the one with a silver metal body and grey plastic ends). Having just switched from III to V, the difference was dramatic.  I have spares of the  III type at my desk -- it's quicker to just grab that than pull the Palm's  one out, and I won't forget to put it back.I'm afraid of wearing down  my Palm's sensor surface, so am shopping for a &quot;softer&quot; stylus  for the V.  (The V's are a touch slimmer, so my spare stylii won't fit its  holder.)",3
"The styli are of sufficient quality for me to be satisfied with them (= they work), but I have two complaints about this product :- The product is said to be &quot;same as stylus provided with product&quot; and a &quot;genuine Palm quality product&quot;. It is neither. These styli do not fit the silo perfectly and the screws at the top and bottom are badly made, in contrast to the perfect screws and silo fitting of those that were provided with the product.- The price is excessive. Why should a simple piece of mass produced plastic cost over three U.S.$s, especially considering the mediocre quality of the product ?",4
"If you want to convert your VHS video tapes into digital format and don't want to purchase an expensive video capture card, this is an alternative.I've been able to convert VHS tapes into decent MPG, Real, and Microsoft Windows Media files in size 320 x 240, but not without some hassle. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, the software that comes with this product is very buggy and be prepared to spend some time troubleshooting to get it working.Here's my first experience. I use Windows 2000 on a PIII 550Mhz, with 256 RAM and 20 Gig EIDE harddrive. When Dazzle arrived, I followed the directions and installed the software and put the plug in the USB port and then discovered that this software only works with Windows 98. I visited the Dazzle web site and found out that you have to purchase a program called Movie Star is you want to use it with Windows 2000. I wound up ordering the software for [more $] plus shipping. Once, I received the new disk, I installed it, and once again, it did not detect the unit when I plugged it into the USB port. And again, I visited the Dazzle web site. I discovered that they have posted a patch for the Movie Star software that fixes &quot;some minor problems.&quot; I downloaded and installed the patch and after rebooting the machine, I was able to get it to detect the unit.The next step was to get Dazzle to work with my cheap... Mitsubishi VHS player. I was able to get it to work with the S-Video port from my Panasonic DV camcorder, but I couldn't get it to detect the output plugs from the VHS player. Finally after rebooting the machine twice, I got it to work.Next getting the software to work was another challange. despite having a fast machine with a lot of RAM, I found the Movie Star program to be very unstable. I was able to capture up to 60 minutes of video and save it to the MPEG format, but everytime I tried to edit or export the video as Windows Media or Real, it crashed the machine. I downloaded a copy of Ulead's Video Studio, but couldn't figure out how to import MPEG files. I finally bit the bullet and wound up downloading a free 30-day trial of Adobe Premier. I found Premier to be a very stable and easy to use program. I just wish it didn't cost [so much!]For my trouble, I found the output from Dazzle to be satisfactory. You would get better results if you spent big money for video capture card that would let you plug an S-Video cable into the back of your PC. Another better alternative would be to use Firewire. (I always use Firewire with my Panasonic DV camcorder and it works great.)After my experience, I cannot recommend this unit to others. I don't think it's fair that this company charges Windows 2000 users extra $.. for buggy software. And I think they could improve the USB connect so it isn't so difficult to use. I am giving this Unit two stars because it does the job, but only after spending a lot of time and some additional money to make it work.",2
The USB version of the Dazzle DM4100 video capture box is an excellent way to capture video into the MPEG1 format in real time.  This format plays back well on modern PC and Mac computers but doesn't take up too much hard drive space.  The quality isn't as good as a professional encoder but then  it costs about a tenth of the price.,5
"First time I plugged it in and installed the drivers it worked instantly. Captured about four hours worth of high quality video with no sync problems on a P3-450 with 128megs ram.I then installed a USB cd writer. The  Dazzle device no longer works. I really don't care what installing the cd  writer did, I see this as a major flaw. My USB cd writer and USB zip drive  work perfectly. I'm now forced to use this device on another, much slower  computer. Nothing about this is mentioned on their site.This product is  VERY flakey. After making changes to video settings, you must exit the  program, unplug the device, plug it back in, and restart the capture  program. This seems to be Dazzle's solution for every problem I've  encountered with this piece of uhm.. plastic.It feels as if this product  was rushed out in a &quot;just make it work&quot; strategy. Dazzle  obviously did not test this product thoroughly enough before finalizing  it.Stay away. Get a digital camcorder and DV card instead.",2
"If you want a small, low resolution image that has unsynchronized audio (or you have forever to wait on the audio sync), this one is for you!  Oh, yea, don't expect to be able to videoconference with your camcorder.If  you want to capture home videos with no or low loss of quality and want it  done at a reasonable speed, you probably don't want this one (or any other  USB or similarly slow external connection).",2
"The Dazzle Multimedia DM4100 Digital Video Creator is very useful to import video from your TV, VCR or DVD player into your PC for editing and then converting to PC video formats. The device is exceptionally good for  making videos for use on the Web or as e-mail attachments. Thanks to its  use of USB its very simple to install and can be &quot;hot-swaped&quot;  with other USB device without rebooting your computer.I don't recommend  using the device if you plan on editing videos on your computer and want to  export it to video tape. If you will be using the device primarily for  making videos for web broadcasting there is an Internet version available  that is optimized for this task. The Internet version also includes a  RealVideo converter and encoder.The included software package is very  useful and stable. However, the included Ulead Video Studio and Ulead Photo  Express are not the most current version.",3
"Obviously there must have been an issue with a lot of the players that were made with this model #, but I haven't seen it. I've had the player for 6 years + and never had one issue with it. its the first and only stand alone dvd player i've had and works wonderfully. I also own 2 sony tvs, a sony reciever and vcr and satellite system and haven't once had an issue. I think that sony has continued their product quality no matter where they're built.",5
"DVD's work just fine in this player.But I purchased it with the intention of viewing home movie VCD's.Not happenin'.No matter what I try (VCD,SVCD,different cd-r disks,...) this model WILL NOT play them.I've seen DVD players costing under $100 play the very same VCD's without any problems.",2
"I bought this DVD from Amazon in November, have watched wellover 20 DVD's (see why later) and played a lot of CDs. Nolip-sync. The CD sounds even better than my other CD deck. What I like most is the headphone jack that allows me to listen to CD and watch DVD just with the DVD machine powered on, without disturbing others. Now the best part... that even Amazon staff does not know. This machine qualifies for 7 free DVDs and 33 free rental (10 from Netflix, 13 from Blockbuster via Sony coupon and 10 from Blockbuster 10/20 program). I waited until now to write this comment because I want to verify the above. I got all that.  What can I say: outstanding picture, gorgeous sound (I had a full 5 speakers sound system mated to a 5X100 Watts Dolby Digital, DTS receiver), and all the freebies listed above. You must be nut for buying any other DVD brand. After all, this is a Sony!",5
"Mine is a just over a year old. Guess what? Yep, it's croaking. In fact, every Sony product I bought the past decade -- a phone, 2 portable CD players, a TV, and now this -- failed just after the warranty expired. I've finally learned my lesson.",1
"This is a great machine all around. What puts this ahead of other units is that you can pull up the DVD menu not only from the remote but also on the front of the unit. It even has a Jog-shuttle dial on the unit for Still, Pause and Frame advance which is very smooth. This unit even has a built-in 5.1 Dolby Digital Decoder for 5.1 Upgradable Receivers. You get a choice of Composite, S or Component video outputs. The remote works on all SONY TVs. Very, very good for the money.",5
"I bought a Sony 530 in 08/1999, and have had no lip-sync problems at all.  The only problem I have noticed is that a disc is supposed to resume from the point you stopped when you push &quot;stop&quot; and the display says  &quot;resume.&quot;  Mine does not do this consistently, and never seems to  do it with CD, but perhaps this feature does not work with CD.  Aside from  that one baffling inconsistency, I love my 530.  I have it hooked into a  Yamaha Dolby Digital &quot;ready&quot; receiver, and find that the bass  management controls in the Sony 530 are excellent for setting up my system.  I have a full surround system using all Paradigm Monitor series speakers,  and the sound from the 530 when used as a CD player is so clear that you  can hear individual string plucks on guitar, and other details you don't  often hear.  The picture quality is so superior to VHS, that I can scarcely  stand to watch VHS anymore.  When it comes to video products, and  particularly digital video, you can't beat Sony.  Don't waste your money  trying any other brands.  You'll just wish you had bought Sony to begin  with.",5
"I have owned this player for approximately 3 years and have learned all (or at least most) of its foibles. There are several major problems you should be aware of with this unit:(1) Lip synch problems. The audio and video streams will unpredictably go out of synch from time to time, requiring you to stop the dics and restart to get the streams back in synch.(2) Noticeable video artifacting (jaggies, combing, moire, etc.) on ordinary DVD discs that have scenes with ""difficult"" MPEG encoding.(3) Poor handling of many discs with extremely subtle scratches. One disc we rented (Talented Mr. Ripley) was so bad that the Sony S530D would not play an entire chapter of the movie. However, the el cheapo DVD player in my dinosaur laptop computer playerd it without incident.(4) Most of the time, the player spontaneously turns itself ""off"" about ten seconds after you turn it ""on"".  When I turn it ""on"" a second time it stays ""on"" properly.  It doesn't matter if there is a DVD in the tray or not, or if you turn it ""on"" from the front panel or with the remote(5) Slow transition from one DVD layer to the next.In short, buying this machine was a bad idea when it was first introduced. Today, there must be literally scores of better models out there. Buy one of them instead.",2
"The DVD player is great.  Perfect mid-range player, with a good mix of features vs. price.  Did notice a lip-sync problem with one DVD, but it has not occurred in the past month or two, but I shall keep watching for  it.If you get this DVD player, you will not be disappointed.",5
"The &quot;lip-synch&quot; problem has shown up on my 550D model once while watching over 30 movies.Other than this issue, the DVD player rates 5 stars!!!",5
"I have to assume that the lip-synch problem referred to inearlier reviews must have been taken care of, because I haven'tencountered the slightest problem. The video quality is simply astonishing - I won my wife over by doing a direct comparison with the laserdisc and DVD versions of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; - she is 100% sold now! There's enough flexibility that you can upgrade to a component-video-capable TV if you don't have one now; I'm using the S-video output and THAT blows me away.  The remote has EXCELLENT human factors engineering - I have no trouble using it in a dimly-lit room for the usual functions (pause, slow forward/backwards, fast, etc.) plus some HANDY features like &quot;How much time is left on the movie?&quot; Menu access is simple and intuitive, too - no teeny-tiny pixie-sized buttons to feel around for. Full 5.1 outputs and DTS/Dolby Digital if you can use them and a host of options for the two-three speaker folks. Really, this has everything you could ask for in a player in this price range - I don't know who selected the Toshiba as Amazon's pick, but THIS is REALLY the one you want!",5
"I bought this DVD player and have had no problems whatsoever.  The picture quality has been flawless, as has the sound.  I have NOT had any lip-sync or fuzzy lines, etc.I have played both Austin Powers movies, Rounders, Contact, Pulp Fiction, and two Gratefuld Dead  DVD's, along with an assortment of audio CD's.It did take me a little  while how to figure out how to get the audio set up properly for 5.1, as  the default setup when you buy it is for just two front speakers.",4
"After reading every review we could find, we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital camera.  We were definitely not disappointed.After just a few days the  camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while  we nervously left our Canon SLR at home.  The camera performed marvelously.  We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian &quot;ger&quot; (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP  Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper.  I doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot.  The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use.  You will absolutely love the Quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots!One of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one.  If you frame... say, a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area.  Olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do you think a  16MB memory card will be too small for your needs?  Olympus, through their  website, is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of December  that will allow the camera to use the new 32MB memory cards.",5
"The Olympus D-340R is, in my opinion, the best value digital camera available right now.The picture quality is impressive---I usually can't tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken  with a $340 SLR that I have scanned in.Also, the camera is fairly  lightweight and compact and easy to use, like a good point and shoot camera  should be.Since I bought my Olympus, I have not taken 1 non-digital  photograph.  I enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from  developing and film costs (some $10/roll).Overall, the camera is worth  the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital  photography.",5
"I have owned an Olympus 340 for two years and I've been very happy with it...but I recently upgrade to the Olympus 3040 because the 340 just couldn't give me the print-quality I was looking for!  Frame a photo from the 340 and you can tell it is a digital photo.  Frame a photo from the 3040 and you would never know it was digital!  So, I love this camera and it was a great camera for me to learn about digital photography and to see if I liked a digital camera more than my old 35mm.  But, two years later, I've found the need to upgrade.  However, due to the significant price jump, the comparisons to the 3040 are not totally fair!  So I still give the 340 a rating of 5 stars because for the price I think it is a great option!",5
"I posted a review of this camera a few weeks ago, shortly after purchasing it.  I gave it 4 stars, mainly because the manual wasn't well written.  However, that still being the case, I must say that this camera deserves 5 stars!  It takes amazingly clear, bright pictures.  The video display LCD  is bright.  And it seemed to take forever for the rechargable batteries to  run down! I highly recommend this camera!  If it had an optical zoom, it  would be perfect.  However, with this camera, you get more than you pay for!",5
"So many people have written about the technical part of this wonderful camera. I agree with many of them. You won't feel bad about spending your $$$. I've shopped around and I've made my decison with confidence. (Yes,  you can find this item for less at other e-stores, but I trust Amazon, they  deliver promptly and their Customer Service is great!)  Some customers have  said that this camera eats batteries like crazy. It's only true when you  use the LCD monitor to TAKE pictures. If you use it  for reviewing (and  deleting) the pictures you have taken, it lasts a long, long time. I have  purchased my camera before Thanksgiving. It's December 12, and after taking  hundreds of pictures (most using flash), I am STILL using the batteries it  came with!  Lemme tell ya a little secret, if you do take pictures using  the LCD monitor, and you get the message that the battery is low, turn off  the camera, let it rest for a little while and turn it back on again. The  battery life will show full again! No need to change the batteries until it  tells you it's dead and you have been taking pictures using the viewfinder.  Now, it is not a bad idea to get yourself some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  I've seen many good comments about the brand MAHA. Also, I have seen great  reviews on MAHA's charger model MH-C204F. Some people have mentioned them  here. But I didn't know where to purchase them from. So here you go. For  more info on the MAHA products, go to Maha-comm website. And to purchase  these two products, check out Thomas-distributing's website (sorry I can't  include the exact web addresses according to the reviews guidelines, but it  isn't hard to figure out). For around $50 I got the charger and 8 NiMH  batteries. Now you can go on the road and not worry about your batteries  dying or where to purchase them.  It's a lot of fun to have a digital  camera and take hundreds and hundreds of pictures knowing you don't have to  pay for developement or wait to finally see your pictures. Just download  them and enjoy or use the video cable to see your photos on your TV. Or  just use the LCD monitor! :)  -- From a happy Olympus/Amazon customer. :)",5
"I've owned the camera for one week and it has worked very good so far. I agree with the other customers about the manual... it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language, not three languages together in one  page. But the camera is very easy to use, takes excellent pictures and has  many nice features. With a tripod, you can take great pictures at night  without the flash! The software is also very easy to use. Although it's not  documented in the manual, the camera comes with a TWAIN driver, so you can  choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your  favorite photo editing software.",5
"La Olympus D-340R ha sido mi &uacute;nica c&aacute;mara digital, la he tenido por m&aacute;s de 3 a&ntilde;os y no tengo queja alguna excepto por dos cosas:1.  Si se utiliza la pantalla LCD para tomar fotograf&iacute;as panor&aacute;micas o con el zoom incorporado, las bater&iacute;as no van a durar casi nada.2.  El transferir las im&aacute;genes a la PC puede tardar una eternidad &uacute;nicamente para ver el contenido de la tarjeta de memoria, luego viene el proceso de bajarlas al disco duro.  Consejo:  hay que comprar el adaptador AC de lo contrario las bater&iacute;as se consumir&aacute;n velozmente!Respecto a la calidad de las fotos, no me puedo quejar de nada.  Excelente calidad y si quieren tener m&aacute;s espacio para almacenar... compren la tarjeta SmartMedia de 16MB mientras duren existencias!",4
"This may have only 1.2 mp but it is the best camera ever made in the digital  arena!  Really. (as evidenced by the unusually hi cost in the used camera market for these 1.2-1.3mp cameras) I own 4 of them and use them for my business.  People are always commenting on what great quality photos I produce.  The adjustment allows you to take photos in low  pixels so the saved photos won't eat up all the space on your computer or camera card.**A note of caution, the smart cards with 4-8 mpixels that fit this camera are very difficult to find now days and expensive to boot.I think it won't take over a 16mp card.",5
This is a great little camera. A real bargain at this price. Excellent color and quality pictures. Only drawback is slow serial interface to computer. Buy a Flashpath floppy adapter or a memory card reader to  transfer pictures faster. A good card reader that won't crash your system  is made by SIIG. They call it their USB DigiFilm-Combo Reader. About $79  street price. Also get the MAHA charger and NIMH batteries reviewed  elsewhere on this page.,5
"This DVD player is great for home or travel. Only two little quirks: the bottom gets really hot, and you can't plug it in to a car outlet. Otherwise it is really cool!",5
"if you like dvd watching on planes or in airports, this player is excellent.  it does get a little hot, but not too bad.  the amount you pay for this unit has come down now due to a new model out in a few months with  a 7 inch screen.",5
"I love this player! I travel frequently and the L50 keeps me company in the airport lounge and on the Airplane. The folks that make the PowerXtender laptop adapters for airplanes are going to be shipping one for  the L50 so you won't need to take extra batteries on those long flights.  The screen is very nice looking, and the 16x9 format lets you view  anamorphic format DVDs in their best possible resolution. Of course, the  wide screen also causes you to curse the DVDs that AREN't anamorphic (e.g.,  Titanic). The sound from the built-in speakers is ok, but sounds very good  from a pair of headphones. For travelers I recommend a pair of the Sony  Noise Cancelling Ear Buds.",5
"Hey, this is by far the biggest step up in portable tube-vision that will ever happen.  Great picture and sound quality comes from the 2 speakers.  The only thing that you might want to think about here is the battery life!  This was a major frustration in trying to watch any movie more than 2  hours long since the battery life is approximately two hours.  This was  pretty good however, and the battery life doesn't hurt the rating for me  since I got the power adapter!",5
"Otherwise very good - Never tested limits of the battery - have used on AC generally - works very well, pricey - I would wait for one more generation if too expensive",4
"We use this when travelling on airlines.  But to make it work the very best, you need a couple of additional items.  1.  You need GOOD noise cancelling ear phones to get rid of the background noise on airplanes,  trains, buses, cars, etc.  Panasonic Model RP-HC100 or similar.  2.  You  need a 'splitter' so that two of you (if you have a significant other) can  watch the movie together.  (Radio Shack) Then all you need to bring is  popcorn.  3.  For those long flights, you'll need one or two extra  batteries.  The battery that comes with it will play for about three  hours.  It takes a LONG time to charge these batteries (about four hours)  so be prepared.  ENJOY!",5
"I absolutely LOVE this product.  The picture and sound are both great.  The unit comes with enough cables to get you hooked into a TV.  It even has on optical out, so you HI-FI buffs will enjoy pure digital...I travel  quite a bit and this thing has been great for occupying my time...As far  as not using it on an airplane- I disagree.  I beleive the line goes-  &quot;Portable electronic devices may now be used with the expection of  cellular phones and pagers...&quot;  Most all laptops have cd-roms and they  have not been the cause of any plane crashes to date.In summary- if you  travel a lot get it, but shop around for the best deal.",5
"I get only 2:15 of battery life on average, barely enough to watch a good movie.I'd love to see cheaper packs, or a camera battery add on option.It plays +R but not +RW disks.",4
"I read the reviews by other people here and am wondering loudly whether they know what these batteries are for? they are Rechargeable batteries for high-drain devices that require higher mAh rating. NiMH batteries or NiCd batteries do not hold charge like an alkaline battery so if you have charged an NiMH battery and put it in say an alarm clock, the batteries will lose charge in less than a month. they are for immediate usages like digital cameras where you need high mAh batteries and that digital cameras drain batteries. its more like ""spend it immediately"" battery unlike the disposable batteries that discharge in a circuit but drain very slowly when not in a circuit. I use Energizer AA batteries for my digicam and they recharge the flash much faster than even the best disposable batteries. A best guide is to look whether the appliance for which you are buying this battery is listed on the package or is identical to those on the package. this 9V would be a great thing for a toy where the battery drains out fast and you cannot afford disposable ones everyday.Just a note: If the device is a direct draining one like a motor and not in a solid-state circuit, do not use a rechargeable battery since if they are completely drained, they cannot be recharged.",4
This is a very good product! It still take a charge! Very good echarable battery. My husband uses it for his recording mixer! Good to have for outdoors use.,3
"I charged this battery up and tried it in my garage door opener remote - it used to open from about 80 feet away, but now it barely works at 10 feet.  I'd recommend that you stay away from this 9V.  I have been quite happy with the other NiMh sizes from Energizer.",1
They don't hold a charge.  I have found it's a lot cheaper to buy regular Duracell batteries at Costco and just keep replacing!,1
We use this in our alarm clock for when the power goes out as it often does.  So far this little rechargable hasn't needed a recharge & is doing a fine job making sure when get up on time when the power goes out & then back on while were sleeping.  I gave it 4 stars because we haven't had it long enough to get a really good opinion on it aside from the one just given.,4
SO FAR SOO GOOD ...IT WORKS AND RUN LIKE A POWER BATTERY!!! IF YOU LIKE POWER THIS IS A MUST BUY,5
"This battery, like other rechargable batteries I own, is rated for 8.4 volts and I'm told is likely even less.  Why not go with Maha?  It's rated at over 9 volts, which for my applications (powering a headroom micro dac) makes all the difference.  I can only imagine that a battery with a rating which conforms to a devices' designated power requirements, is better across the board.",1
"I bought two of these batteries with the Overnight Nimh Family Battery Charger, and so far the batteries have performed as expected. haven't used it enough to see if they take memory if charged to frequently but so far so good. Great product!So now I have used this product for 5 months on a Microphone to line amplifyer and they last about 2 days on average.  The batteries take 10 to 13 hours for a full charge which is pretty ridiculous! luckly I only use one at a time so I have time to charge the other one.I would still say Great Product!",5
"I ordered the product for the purpose of having to use them in our Wireless Handset Mic System for the church, they work great! We were going through about 4 9V batteries every week, but with this it holds enough charge for the wireless system for 2 1 hour services each battery! It has taken the cost of batteries from $15 a week to nothing and it can be charged overnight! No Problems at al with them, in fact we ordered 2 of them for backups along with 4 AA rechargables that we use for our CD players and Recordering devices and they al work wonders!",5
"I like Energizer rechargeable batteries. I've used several before.This one is on a sprinkler timer and so far, so good.",5
"I teach 4 one-hour classes a week, which require a 9-Volt battery for the mic. I got tired of buying these every week or two, so I bought the rechargable.  The single charge lasts the entire week. I recharge it on the weekends and I'm ready to go...no problems so far.  I've had it for 3 months or so..",5
"I'm a strong supporter of rechargeable batteries, but at 7.2 Volts, this just doesn't meet my needs.  Devices that use batteries are designed to work across a range of voltages because as the battery is used, the voltage slowly drops until the battery just runs out of juice.  When the dying battery crosses a certain voltage threshold, some devices warn you of a low battery.  This is a good thing, because you don't want, say, your smoke alarm to need to go onto backup battery power and not have the juice it needs.  The problem here is that the devices I use seem to cross the low battery voltage threshold somewhere around 7.0 volts.  That is to say, I put a fully charged battery in there and before I know it (about 1 week or 2), the low battery light comes on in my answering machine or the smoke alarm starts doing it's low battery beeping thing.  Nope, this is no good.  I suggest you steer clear of Energizer and go for another brand that has an 8.4 nominal voltage (or better yet 9.6 if that extra .6V isn't going to harm your device--NiMH cells go in increments of 1.2 V so as far as I know there is no way to get a 9.0 V battery).Sure this will work in many devices, but I really don't see why Energizer opted to go for a 7.2V battery instead of 8.4V other than to save a small amount of money.  That seems like a very off-brand sort of thing to do.  1 star only from me.",1
"The Energizer Battery charger seems to be a great buy for the money. I have been using it for many years without any problems. The NimH Batteries seem to last long and a good charger does help.  I bought 2 extra chargers so I could charge 12 at one time.  Another great feature is that this battery charger could charge all types of batteries. You don't need different chargers for different batteries. I have shopped around ther internet and when Amazon has it in stock in their store, Buy It! They have the best price!I would buy 2 and get the free super saving shipping at the same time. Happy Charging! Peace, Anthony",5
"works good, much sturdier than the cheapo other brands. definitley a keeper!",4
"I have used this charger for a while and it works really well.  It charges both NiMH and NiCd batteries in all sizes AA,AAA,C,D& 9 volt.  A full charge takes about six hours.  You can charge different sizes at the same time.  I consider this charger a very good investment and recommend it to all.",5
"The only reason that I use this charger is in case I have a battery that is too dead to charge with my wonderful Maha MH-C801D charger.  Unfortunately the Maha MH-C801D needs some slight residual charge remaining for the processor to initiate a charge, so that is why I sometimes need to use this Energizer CHM4FC for around a half a minute to give the battery just enough juice for the Maha MH-C801D to initiate a charge.  The Energizer CHM4FC does not care how dead a battery is, but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my Maha which uses pulsed charging.  The Maha can even erase the memory effect of old batteries.  At least the Energizer CHM4FC does not burn up the batteries like those terrible life shortening 15 minute chargers however.",3
"This is a versatile charger that charges all standard size NiMH and NiCads, and reliably. I have used it for a year with no problems, a good value for the price.Smarter chargers have been recommended here(at about three times the price) to compensate for some of the issues with not-so-smart but less expensive chargers like this one. I must admit, the information provided by Energizer with this charger doesn't help to understand the limitation of this 'fixed time' charger.It will put 430MilliAmps for 5 Hours into a AA NiMH. 430Ma times 5 Hours = 2100MaH. It uses 370Ma in its 'NiCad' setting for 3 Hours = 1100Mah for AAs. Since there is always some existing charge left in rechargeables before recharging, if your NiMH AA's capacity is less than 2500Mah(typically yes for AA NiMH) they will be fully charged by this charger. Likewise, NiCad AAs less than about 1200MaH(typical for NiCads) your batteries will be fully charged.You can use the information above and the charging currents given on the Spec Sheet for this charger to figure charging capacities for other size and capacity batteries. C and D size capacities greater than 30000MaH will not be fully charged in one 5 hour cycle and will have to be cycled twice(2 X 3000Mah = 6000Mah)or more times, unless left in the charger to trickle charge for a long period of time(a good idea in any case to top off all charges). Every 24 hours of 65ma trickle current will add another 325MaH charge to a C or D cell till it reaches its full rated Mah capacity. Trickle charging batteries by leaving them in the charger after the 'timed' charge cycle (5 hours on 'NiMH' setting, 3 hours on 'NiCad') will keep your batteries topped off to full capacity at all times without hurting them.So, this charger is a good value if you understand what it does and and does not do. Those with less knowledge or time, but more money, may want to buy the more expensive Smart Chargers others have mentioned here. The Vanson would be my choice, a very good value. I have derated this charger because of lack of information provided to the consumer by Energizer on its site and on its Spec Sheet for this charger. They're not alone in this department, but there is still no excuse for this.If you really don't need a Universal(all battery types charged) then you can get a Smart AA/AAA combination charger for much less. I would recommend the RipVan Lighting 4000N at RipVan100.Com. It charges fast but gently(doesn't over-heat batteries, a life killer).Hope this has helped everyone. Rechargeables are the only way to go for saving you gobs of money and the environment gobs of abuse. Buy good high capacity rechargeables, like highly rated Energizer's, and buy a good charger that will treat them right for you. Noooooo overheating by cheap Quick Chargers.",3
My neighbor and I bought this charger but I returned mine and I think she is going to return hers also.  It seems a little dated because it charges the batteries for a fixed amount of time (both NiMH and NiCad).  So if your battery is only slightly discharged it'll still charge it for the same time as if it were totally dead.  It also can't charge batteries individually which my Rayovac charger can.  The only downfall of my Rayovac is that it can only charge AA and AAA which is all I need.  I paid 25 dollars for the Energizer and the Rayovac was only 10 dollars...  BIG difference.  If you can find a Rayovac recharger at your local store get it!  I even got 16 NiMH batteries for 25 dollars - PLUS they're ALL 1600mah (higher the rating the more power).  Just thought I'd let everyone know.  Alohaz,2
"It appears that there are several battery rechargers available that may be better for specific needs. For example, one may want a faster recharger for use with a camera, or one that does AA batteries only, or one that work with nickel-metal batteries only.  For more specialized uses, there are instruments that are both higher and lower in price.That said, I agree that this is a versatile, reasonably priced recharger.  As you can see above, it works on size AA, AAA, C, D, and 9V batteries. I've used the recharger safely now for over a year (Please read all safety instructions), usually by plugging it in at night.  As noted elsewhere, you need to charge one or two pairs of batteries at a time (with the exception of 9v batteries). Here are a few specs for people with some electrical knowledge (unlike myself; I just read these off the back):Input:  AC120V, 60Hz, 15WOutput: 2x (2.8v...500mA)2x (9.8v...13mA)NOTE:  As stated clearly on front and back, use ONLY for rechargeable nickel-metal hydride or nickel-cadmium batteries (not both at the same time, however). Also, these batteries are generally more expensive than non-rechargeable alkaline batteries, but for people who have a lot of toys and tools with different battery needs, this may be the one to get.",5
"Batteries are expensive no matter what you buy.  This recharger is inexpensive and dependable.  Given that there are four battery docks, you'll never run out of charged batters.  This recharger quickly charges nickel metal hydrido (NiMH), nickel-cadmium (NiCD), AAA, AA or 9V rechargeable batteries.  The price is fantastic and what it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in power and speed.  When the batteries are charged, the light displays green and be warned that it is normal for the batteries to be warm.  Unfortunately there is no real carrying case for travel.",4
great for the 9volt and D but for AA and AAA it does not do as fast as the smaller rapid charger ones form energizer.,4
"I use the cable at home on my home desktop PC.  It's great for synchronizing my Palm IIIxe with my home and work PC.  I use avantgo.com at home to add news to my Palm (which I can't do at work).Best of all it is cheaper then the cradle and it does the exact same thing.  The only thing missing is the button that you get on the cradle.  Instead, you launch HotSync from your Palm.",5
"Useful, versatile, lightweight, and convenient.This small lightweight cable is easy to travel with.  Use it to sync your laptop or connect to any  other serial device.I bought it to use as a second hot sync cable to  help keep by home computer and work computer synced.  The full sized cradle  is more expensive and less versatile.You can use it to turn your Palm  into a terminal, via a modem or direct connection.  Note: you may need a  null modem adapter for some devices.For programmers, I think this cable  is fabulous. It makes the Palm useful as a programming interface for any  serial device.The low cost of a Palm and cable means any small serial  interface device, like a voicemail system, can have a permanent or  temporary display hooked up without adding a lot of expensive hardware, or  hauling around a heavy laptop.I think this concept will increase the  need for Palm programmers and generate a new breed of Palm based  application interfaces with associated software.Buy it if you need a  method to sync to a laptop when travelling, or for an interface for a  serial device.",5
"I have to agree with other users that this is a great product, BUT it's not as practical as you may think. A USB sync cable is a better idea. Talk about convenience. Secondly, the cable is too long! Who needs 3' (or 2') or cable to connect a Palm to a Laptop  computer? The reason why I'm writing this review is because I haven't been able to find a USB sync cable. I called Palm, there is none available. I visited the stores, there is none available. Will anybody have the brilliant (and obvious) idea of creating this device?! I also write this review for those of us who use laptop computers with USB ports and don't want anything to do with legacy hardware.",2
"Don't travel with the cradle, and don't wait until you return from a trip to synch with your laptop.  Just roll up one of these and stick it in your laptop case.  This is especially useful for Palm VIIs, which can't use the  version of PalmOS that supports synching through the IR port.This cable  does not have a synchronize button. In order to use it, connect the cable,  turn on your Palm, press the HotSynch icon, and press the LocalSynch icon.Remember that leaving your Palm in the cradle or leaving this cable  connected to both your Palm and your computer will put an extra drain on  your batteries, so you should unhook your Palm as soon as you finish  synching.",4
"If you're going to sync from more than one computer, this is a far better option than buying an additional cradle.  To offset the lack of the convenient button on the cradle, you get better portability, a lower cost, and can hook it up to Palms that live in a carrying case without having to rip it away from the velcro.",5
"Though the Palm IIIxe comes standard with a HotSync cradle, that isn't something you want to carry in your pocket. This cable is the ideal solution if you travel or if you need to sync with more than one PC. The generous 3' cable length is perfect - better a long cable than one that's too short.Keep in mind that this is NOT a USB sync cable, it's a practical serial device for the Palm III &amp; VII, along with some of the older models.Read the other reviews here and you'll find other creative uses for this cable, so I won't repeat them here. You'll also see that most of the owners who needed a serial sync cable agree - get this and you won't be sorry.",5
"Lightweight, portable and simple.  These words describe both the HotSync cradle that came with my Palm IIIx and this cable which I just purchased.  However, if you travel a lot, and sync to a laptop or second computer, this  cable is the way to go.I takes up virtually no room in a laptop bag, and  can fit in virtually any luggage pocket (and also a suit pocket).There  is no other software to install.  Just pull the cable out of the bag,  attach to your PC and Palm and sync using the HotSync icon on the Palm  itself.One way that it could be improved would be with a button on the  cable end itself which would trigger the HotSync.  This would most likely  make the cable more expensive and possibly less reliable over the long  term, however.  All in all, a well-designed and utterly useful product.",4
"I received this DVD player yesterday 11/30/99 and my son tried to install it. He is not a genius at electronics. We called the Toshiba service 1-800 support line and were patiently assisted with the installation. This was  extremely helpful to us. This is easy to install but if you aren't an  electronic wiz, this is a very good asset. The DVD player itself seems  flawless to us at this point. I would recommend it highly.",5
"I've had this player for about six months. About 15% of the DVDs that I own have at least one feature that can crash this player, when that happens  the only way to reboot it is to hit the switch disk button, none of the  other buttons will work. The remote control design is pathetic, half of the  buttons are hidden by a cover, and are virtually inaccessable. The skip and  fast forward functions are combined on a single key, to fast-forward you  must hold down the skip button for several seconds, if you don't hold it  down long enough it skips to the next scene. The skip backwards function  doesn't work, it can only return to the start of a scene, not an earlier  one. So if you accidently skip to the next scene you must restart the movie  from the beginning.",2
"I can't find a compelling reason to recommend a higher priced model than this one. Sound and picture as rich as can be. It is worth hooking up to a stereo system if you have one near your television.Remote features are  excellent, allowing for more tricks than you'll use. Chose this after too  many negative reviews of low price Sony models (I'm sure everything is  fixed, but I wasn't going to take a chance over the holidays). Wasn't a  Toshiba fan before this purchase (simple Sony prejudice) but now I'm  willing to spend the big bucks on one of their large TV's. You'll enjoy  this player and its price.",5
"I own this DVD player.  I just bought it in late March 2000.  It is the first DVD player I've ever owned.  The sound and picture are great with my dad's home theater.  I am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom.  I just bought a 32-inch Toshiba tv for my bedroom.For those of you who have problems getting rid of the ZOOM in the lower right hand corner, hit the setup button TWICE, that should get rid of the ZOOM.Enjoy!Update 10/9/07I still have this DVD player and it works great!",5
"This is an awesome DVD player. I bought it after doing a lot of research online and truly understanding how the machine works. It came down to this one.Why?Zoom function: You can actually zoom in and look at minute detail on the movie and pan left and right on it. It also allows for ""outside"" angles -- meaning you can pan left or right while a movie is playing to see outside details from the center screen, if the director/dvd makers allow it (which I'm sure will be the next push in the technology). Speeds: The selection of scan through speeds is amazing -- all with startling clarity. Resolution: I scoffed that a DVD could produce THAT much better resolution and clarity of sound, but whoa man! This is amazing -- I truly am blown away with what kind of quality you get off this DVD player. Compatibility/ease of function: This DVD player is so incredibly easy to use, you basically just plug it in and play a movie.Finally: The dual tray for DVD play. This player comes with two trays to put in two movies -- which you'll find with longer epics out there. It's simple to switch between on disc to the other, and it makes it awfully convenient for viewing pleasure.They should really bring this product back. It's the best out there.",5
"This is a great DVD player.  I like the dual disc operation of this player.  You can put two disc in the player and just sit back and enjoy.  It has every possible connection that you need.  The sound is great, the  picture is great.  I do wish that there was more controls on the front of  the player, like a menu button you must use the remote for all of the  players functions other than play, stop, pause and forward and reverse.  This play also reads HDCD's, but not CDR's which are rewriteable disc.  You  can switch between the two disc and the player continues to play non stop.  I like the feature of changing the black level of the picture which makes  the colors just pop.  This a great machine and a must have.",5
"If you're like me, you use two or more PC's over the course of a normal workday and you use your PalmVx religiously.  Your Palm already came with one cradle, but you really need an extra to ensure all your PC's are in sync.What more can be said...it's the same high quality and easy to use charging cradle that came with your Palm.  Mostly a convenience thing for casual users, but for those who use their Palms alot, you need an extra.  Pick one up now while they're still available.",5
I wanted a Palm Vx because I love the looks but finally settled on the Palm 3xe for several reasons.  1)  The hassle of charging a Vx when travelling is greater than the benefit of not dealing with batteries in  general use.  And a cradle or more expensive travel kit is needed for use  with a second computer or travelling.  2)  The cost of Vx accessories are  too high.  I liked the 3xe because I wanted to hot sync my computer at home  (3xe travel cable is only $17 compared with $40 to $50 for Vx) with my  computer at work where I used the included cradle (free with purchase).  And 3) the bulk of the Vx cases made them as big as the 3xe with included  flip lid.  And this cradle is $20-$30 on top of the price of the Vx.  The  bottom line: The the nice looks of the Vx cost $210 more with all the  accessories like a case and travel kit.  Not worth it.  I'd rather have two  3Xe's.,1
Found an old palm in my basement and wanted to get it working again. Took a chance and bought this cradle to charge it and sure enough it booted up. I have no real use for either the palm or the charger but for as cheap as it was I got it. Worked well.,4
I bought this Palm V Hotsync Cradle as a replacement to my old one that had been stolen...The cradle itself works great. It is easy to install and required no extra software if you already the Hotsync software installed. A good product.,4
"What Can I say? Palm products have always been of the best quality, and the Palm V Hotsync Cradle is no exception. I purchased an extra cradle for use with another desktop, so I can sync with several computers. The cradle bottom is metal, and there is enough weight that it does not move if the cord has a bit of pull on it. A must buy for palm V(x) users that need to sync with another computer, or need one at the office and at home. Whatever the case maybe, its very handy to have an extra cradle around.",5
Didn't work for my device but it lit up and worked. I sent it back with no problem and a full refund.,5
It does what is advertised. Charges palm V and is also  downloads to pc. That I haven't been able to try as the plug on the end of the cable is female and the connection to my laptop is also female. Need an adapter. The charger works great and if it came with a usable connection I would have given it a 5 star rating.,4
"Perhaps the only bummer with the Palm V series is that they have a slow serial port connection, which takes much longer to Sync than a USB port. I'd recommend buying the USB PalmConnect kit instead, which costs about the same. Shop around.",3
"This travel kit takes too much space. If you would like to connect your Palm V or Vx to two computers, I suggest you either buy another cradle, or pack your cradle. A cradle takes up as much space as this travel kit, and  it's better. Remember you can also hot sync through the infrared port if  you have a computer with an infrared port, but this drains the batteries a  lot.",2
"The item pricing was good however, I did not get to enjoy their uses because I could not get my palm pilot completely operational...something had expired?.",3
"I agree with others here.  All the components of this kit work very well.  I took my Palm Vx to Italy and had no trouble keeping it charged thanks to the adapters.  I felt safe doing it with the converter too.  I know people who have damaged computer equipment by trying to make do with cheap adapters.The sync cord is great.  I use it at work instead of buying another cradle.  It would be nice if they sold this separately.In the end, my only problem with this kit is the price.  It's a bit much for what you get.  I suppose if you travel overseas a lot it'll pay for itself eventually.  Occaisional travellers will just have to swallow the cost.Do I hear any third party vendors out there???PS: This would get 4 stars if it were cheaper and 5 stars if you could use the adapter plugs with other things (they're made to be used only with this converter).",3
"This is very useful addition for Palm for people who travel internationally. Unless you are someone who travels to all the corners of the world, you may never use some of the plug adapters. I particularly like the hotsync cable. I can use it for syncing the Palm with my notebook.Comes in a neat pouch too.",5
"I travel quite often, and lugging around the weighty Hot Sync/Charger cradel adds some pounds to my briefcase. With the travel kit, the charger and Hot Sync cable are seperate, and much lighter, without the stand like the cradle. Works just as good as the cradle too. I like the fact that the charger comes with 3 extra plugs, which can be used for different countries! Great travel kit at a reasonable price.",5
"Like the previous reviewer, I also purchased the Kodak NiMh batteries and charger and have found it to be a much-needed improvement to the standard package.  Too bad Nikon doesn't include this as standard equipment with its  digital cameras.  My wish list:  an automotible cigarette-lighter adapter  so I can recharge batteries &quot;on the fly&quot;.  Overall, a quality  product that functions as advertised and provides good value for the money.",5
"... I bought these, and mine came with 1450 batteries. ...Another  note: It doesn't have an electric cord, just two plug-prongs that flip out  and go into a socket.  Makes it very compact, somewhat elegant.  BUT: its  design is such that (1) it doesn't work well in a horizontal outlet, only  in a vertical outlet, i.e. where the switch plate is a vertical rectangle.  In a horizontal outlet, the box ends up hanging precariously on its side,  prone to falling out of the wall.  (2) if you happen not to have the lower  outlet open, it doesn't sit readily in the upper outlet because it's upside  down so the weight of the batteries tends to pull it away from the wall.  So far it hasn't fallen out in this position, but it's probably gonna some  day.  Personally, I think a regular electric cord and plug would have been  better -- I suspect Kodak just wanted to save a few bucks, and calls it a  &quot;feature&quot;.  Other than that it's okay, but why did I really spend  this much money?  As long as it's UL listed, buy yourself a cheaper  recharger from a major brand name, and make sure it's intended for nimh  batteries if that's what you want.",4
"For a slightly less price, you can get yourself a negative pulse charger.  A negative pulse charger strips away sulfate buildup and gas bubbles that basically ruins any rechargable batteries.Take a look at the Maha C210 charger or Radio Shack cat 23-422 pulse charger.  They're microprocessor controlled so that you can't overcharge your batteries.  With the C210 you can charge any type of battery ranging from 3V to 12V.",3
"This kit comes with everything you need to 'go rechargable' with one of today's digital cameras.  I use it for my Nikon Coolpix and have noticed that one full charge of the 1450 mA batteries lasts 5-6 times as long as  the disposable alkaline batteries that came with the camera.  Full  recharging takes about 3 hours.  The plug on the back of the charger folds  up into the unit so you can slip it into your pocket or bag with no problem  and be rechargable anywhere!Overall, slightly more expensive than other  units out there, but worth it.  Be sure to get 1450 mA NiMH (nickel metal  hydride) batteries if you're going to buy extra batteries with it; you'll  find all kinds of uses for them (pager, penlight, handheld games, etc.)",5
"It's a great charger. You can basically bring it to anywhere you go. But one advice, don't buy too many batteries, because most of the time you think  that you really need a lot of batteries, but after you really bought  a lot of batteries, you will realize that you don't need that much! And  regret about wasting money. And if you are out of battery, you can just  charge them again, two hours after, they are full charged.",4
"This is indeed a lightweight tripod, as advertised.  I didn't expect Manfrotto carbon-fiber quality, but the head is a bit disappointing.  The quick-release plate is somewhat fussy to get onto a camera and into the head.If you're going to mount a still camera and leave it stationary indoors, this unit should work passably, but beware if you're going to use it with a video camera:  mine doesn't pan smoothly and wobbles quite a bit when using any controls on my Canon HG21 or the Rode SVM mounted on top, or when people walk around nearby.  This leads to shaky video, even with in-camera IS, which in turn works against the compressibility of the resultant files.  The tilt hinge is something of a disappointment, as with a still camera in landscape orientation, when fully closed the camera is slightly tilted.If one's needs are very occasional and don't require panning or much adjustment, this could be a reasonable buy.  It's probably also fine for holding reflectors, mic booms, or lights.  I think, though for video use I'm going to invest in a Slik or other unit around the $90-150 range.",3
I used once.  Very bad quality.  I bought a Manfrotto tripod.  I love it.,1
"...you simply can't beat this deal!GREAT LITTLE TRIPOD!Does the job perfectly as a lightweight ""back-up"" tripod.I do have another big, heavy tripod for windy days but plan to carry this one on hiking trails and long distance trips.Just what I needed.",5
I got all excited since this was a very inexpensive tripod and the reviews were good. Got the item and the first time I used it for Christmas eve photosthe lever that releases the pan and tilt head broke off. Other than that this is a good starter tripod.,2
"This tripod is too short (I virtually always use it extended to full height, including the head), too flimsy (it struggles to hold my Canon 400D still, even with a small lens), and difficult to adjust (the same camera is virtually impossible to hold at much of an angle).  The removable head is also a bit flimsy.  However, it's also light, and ridiculously cheap.  Don't pay more than $15 for it, and you won't be disappointed.",3
"I am amazed with this tripod , it's light and east to set up . the bag is nice too. I can't believe it's so good for such a low price !!",5
"I received this tripod for Christmas and I am totally delighted with it!  It comes with a case and is small and light enough for me to carry.  In just a few days use, it has made a difference on my low light level and non-flash photos.",5
The only reason i give it 4 stars it's because i only paid about 8 bucks for it but it's a toy...,4
"You can't beat the price for a full size tripod for your camera. Great for taking pictures of low light settings, night shots, etc. since the tripod will keep the camera still and won;t blur the shot. The only bad thing is the shipping on this is more expensive than the tripod itself! Still worth it for about $20.",5
"cheap plastic breaks easy, treat gently",4
"The only positive thing I can say about this tripod is that it is very light and very cheap. I tried to use it several times -  does it's job only if the camera is positioned right on top (90 degrees). If you move the camera and change the angle the top stand twists and fall back under the camera weight. I was using canon powershot S3 IS, which is really light. I can't imagine if you use it with a dslr camera. My final conclusion - It is good if you don't need to change the vertical position of the camera.",2
These Teac drives are great. I have them for about 2 months and no problems. Just remember - No cable comes with purchase so make so you have a cable.,4
"Does Not Work for 720k formatting. If you need to be able to format to 720k, this will not work. Otherwise it works fine, but I gave it 2 stars because I am unable to use it and I hope others can be saved the trouble.",2
"I was having sporadic problems with my old floppy drive (also a Teac) so, suspecting the problem was with the drive itself, rather than the motherboard, controller, cable, driver, etc., I went ahead and bought this one from Amazon....  Well, it installed without a hitch, and now works flawlessly.  File transfers are somehow much, much faster -- faster than with my drive at work, and especially compared to my old drive.  Funny that floppy drives don't carry X speed ratings like CD-ROMS -- if they did this one might be an &quot;8X&quot;.",4
This drive made it possible to read some old floppy disks on a new PC.  The new motherboards do not have floppy interfaces.,4
Win 7 detected device without problem.  Wrote to and read from multiple disks without an issue.  Great option for making a boot disk for older pc builds/resurrections.,5
"Good drive, seems to read floppies more reliably than an old internal drive that I was using to try to recover old data.  Used on Windows 7 x64 with no drivers or installation needed, just plug-and-play.",5
"I recently found a couple of floppy disks with documents on them that I thought had been lost for ever -- the disks were 20+ years old and in a fireproof lockbox! -- and I had no computer with a floppy drive that could read them. I wanted something inexpensive but which would work to help me recover the old docs, and this filled the bill.I plugged the disk drive into the usb port of my Asus laptop running Windows 7, and the computer immediately recognized it. I held my breath and put in the first floppy. I opened the floppy from &#34;My Computer,&#34; and there were all of my old documents -- which I was actually able to open and convert to a modern format.I only needed to use this drive once, so I didn't want to spend much money, but on the other hand, I needed something that would work, and preferably without having to deal with installing new drivers for it. This was perfect for my needs. I'd actually used some Sabrent products before, so I hoped it would turn out to be a reliable drive, and it did.",5
"Not much to say here, it works for me.  I was able to access my old floppy drives.  Windows detected it without needing to search for drivers.",4
"The product was delivered on time and seems to work OK, albeit a little slow - but floppies are slow. I used this to transfer some data from an older XP machine to my new Windows 8 computer. No problem as far as I can presently determine.",4
"As others have mentioned, only works with 1.44 disks.  Out of curiosity, did try a single sided 400 and double sided 800 but no luck.  Works ok.  Build feels a little cheap, dive itself is pretty noisy.  I ended up returning & simply using an old computer to read floppies.  If this is your only option worth giving it a try.",3
"Needed a drive for some of my photos that are still on disk.  This one was cheap, but very difficult to eject the disk.  Not satisfied with this at all.",2
does not work with Win& out of the box - have yet to find anything to make it work - find an older machine (XP) and see if you can extract your data.,4
Work well right out of the box after computer searched for and downloaded drivers. Only used once for single floppy with much needed data. Durability unknown. Price was right.,5
"Floppy drive was a great purchase.  Works on all my machines of varying 64/32 bit, operating systems, and motherboard configurations.  Highly recommend this to others.",5
"I'm impressed.  I have windows 7, and was concerned about it working properly. BUT, no problem, it comes with a disc, but of course, you don't need it for windows 7, just plug it in and windows 7 finds and install the driver automatically and I was up and running in under a minute.  This was certainly worth the price.  I had so many 3.5 left over from the 90s.  I had no idea any more what exactly was on them, so I just could never trash them.  And, I am glad I didn't trash them.  There was some great stuff on those things.  Laughs and memories.  It's amazing how things have changed of the past 20 years.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.  And an extra note, it doesn't pull up stuff automatically.  You have to go thru your exporer and find the drive and open it, but if you have 3.5s you probably can handle that.  Cheers, great product.",5
"The unit works flawlessly.  Unfortunately, many software applications that still require floppy disks don't recognize USB floppy drives.  My app is one of those.  I have a partial work-a-round.  I run the software as administrator and despite receiving an error message that no floppy drive exists, the drive starts working.  Go figure.  The 3 stars represents a warning to the buyer to make sure that their applications recognize USB floppy drivers.",3
"We needed a new USB floppy drive to put command programs for projects onto disks for a piece of equipment.  This piece of equipment will only accept 720K DD disks for the project info.  Unfortunately this drive will NOT recognize 720K disks that already have info on them, it will not format them (even through a command line with unconditional override applied).  I tested it with some HD disks as well just to make sure it was a hardware limitation and not a defect.  The drive reads, writes, and formats HD disks (although it is slow and noisy and seems to have some marginal head sensitivity)",2
"Had a client who brought me a 3.5&#34; disk and told me he had to have the data off of it.  Never thought I would have to buy a floppy drive or even use one.  Crazy, but this did exactly what I needed it for even in Windows 8.1.  I figured when I plugged this into an 8.1 machine, Windows would basically tell me, &#34;What is this?  1.44 MB, hahahah&#34;",5
this device worked perfectly just connect it to the motherboard usb headers and your done windows 7 picked it up and it reads my floppy disks with no problems!,5
"So you have your tax records on a floppy, and you need to get that DATA! Whip this bad boy out and you are good to go!",5
Its great.. Did exactly what I needed it to do. Works with Mac Mini. Did not have any problems. :),5
"This USB floppy drive was purchased to allow me to retrieve some files that were still on 3-1/4"" floppy disks (yes, they were ancient). My old PC had a floppy drive in it, but my new laptop did not.The drive plugged in and installed itself with no driver required. The diskettes were read quickly and easily and the data saved off to CDROM for storage.I don't know if I'll ever need this drive again, but if I do, it'll be available and ready.",5
"My main reason for buying this drive was to process a few boxes of floppies (I'd guess 200+ floppies) and I am about halfway through. After unboxing I was able to attach it to my Windows XP box and it picked it right up without any driver installation or administrative rights required.Using WinImage I was able to image aging floppies with &#34;bad spots&#34; (and ignore them even if I couldn't find a way to do so automatically) in order to retrieve data I wanted.I've only just started using it so I can't speak to its long term reliability, but if this drive dies before I finish processing the remaining 100+ floppies I'll  modify my review accordingly.",5
I was very happy with this drive.  It di exactly as described. Simplicity and speed of operation.,4
"The drive I received was Sabrent model SBT-UFDB fitted with a Mitsui drive. The drive installed completely plug and play and operated without any further actions to install it. The operation is a bit querky on some disks, all of which must be High Density (HD) 1.44mb disks. I had one problem and discovered the write protection slide tab was open. Sabrent's latest manual SFT-USDB_NewManual.pdf, from their website, explains that the write protection tab must not be open (so you can see through it -- for those of you that have not been through the glorious 3.5 floppy era) for the drive to function correctly. Also, I tried several techniques to get some floppies to work correctly -- right clicked on folder and selected Open, ejected and replugged the drive without the floppy in it, and several verbal invectives. Most of my photos, program data files and old program installation files seemed to copy easily, albeit slowly, onto the hard drives. Overall, a good bargain compared to the hassle of trying to install a 3.5 floppy into the computer that wasn't designed to accept such an installation. Also, the floppy is an acceptable media for transferring smaller files from computer to computer.",4
"Overall, this floppy drive is a great value. I have used it in both Windows 8 and Linux without issue. It presents a USB Mass Storage device so it doesn't need a special driver.The floppy drives of old were heavy, high quality, and made of metal. They were also very expensive. This floppy drive is lightweight and made primarily of plastic. It is made as well as it needs to be --- especially considering the very low price.Personally, I wouldn't mind paying more for more heavy-duty floppy drive, but the reality is, there is no point. Floppy drives aren't needed very often these days and there's no point in paying extra for a device that will get occasional use at most.",4
"This same drive seems to be sold under many different brand names. Obviously not very high quality, but I need the ability to transfer data by floppy disk to an older machine & this seems to be the only option.I bought 2, 1 works (for now) and the other just wanted to reformat all the time, whether there was a disk in it or not. I guess I'll order a couple more for spares.",3
I had an internal drive stop working on a desktop and got this instead of finding a new internal drive. It works great.,5
It would not work. The software would install properly. I will be returning the item. Very disappointed in the product.,1
"I guess it is hard to complain about any FDD device anymore as manufacturers discontinue the production of 3.5&#34; floppy disks.  This served a purpose but in the end run is just a desperate attempt to read all old floppies and move their info off to CD-Rs for more permanent storage (until the begin to disappear as well)Using this with OS X is a real pain, using it with Parallels 9 on OS X to recover or produce temporary FDDs for Win or MS-DOS apps is useless.  Win machine is the next trial; but, on the front, this will always be a frivolous spend and a somewhat frivolous attempt to resurrect aging and probably bad FDs",3
The Sabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive was exactly what I was looking for... It works perfectly and saved me from destroying all my saved 3 1/2 floppy disks...,5
"I have had this product for about three months now, It works on several media types just as described. I would recommend it to anyone. This is used by me only occasionally, so I do not know about someone using it all the time.",5
"Works great. after all how difficult could it be to make a good floppy drive.I was thinking of getting a used one, but this one is cheaper and gives peace of mind.- compared it with sony external usb and found this one cheaper.- very sturdy, dropped couple of times but it still works.- very plug and play.- never gave me a chance to complain.- works comparaeable to my sony vaio integrated floopy drive",5
"The one I ordered arrived not working. I see from the reviews that this happens fairly frequently. Buying one of these appears to be a roll of the dice.UPDATE:  After returning this item and buying a USB floppy drive from a different manufacturer, I learned that on my OS (Windows 7) that the drive will probably not automatically appear. You have to open the Start menu and choose Computer, and then click the icon for the A drive, to ""activate"" the USB floppy drive. If you then double-click the A icon, you can see the files on any floppy that's inserted into the drive.The Sabrent drive may well have been a fully functioning drive; I just didn't know about this little workaround at the time.",2
Works like a charm. I have used it on two computers and it has worked well on both. I am able to transfer data from the floppies to my hard drive.I would recommend it.,4
Fabulous product at a great price. A very simple &#34;plug 'n' play&#34; way to transfer all those pictures that are on floppy disks,5
"After purchasing a cheaper reader for eleven dollars including shipping that just didn't work on Windows 7, I got a refund and purchased this instead.  It was twenty dollars with free shipping.  As soon as I plugged it in it worked.  I read a good dozen floppies without any issues and was able to transfer the files I needed to my hard drive.  I do recommend this however if you are using windows 7 I'll give you a few pointers.  First off there is no install disc, simply plug into your usb and it will recognize the device.  It will show up under devices and printers so you need to go to start and click on devices and printers and then click on the USB floppy reader right click and open and it should be drive A.  You will more than likely need to do this for each floppy you put in.  It may take up to a minute to read the entire floppy it's not as quick as a standard external drive or usb stick by any means...however it will read your old floppies and if you wish you can even transfer files to it and take it with you.Bottom line, this works great you just need a little patience.",5
"These little things can be lifesavers.  In modern times, a floppy drive is nearly a dinosaur, and the majority of new computers don't &#34;waste&#34; space on them.  That's sensible, as they're seldom needed.  However, there remain those old &#34;sacred&#34; files long ago squirreled away on floppies, and their loss can upon occasion be a catastrophe of sorts.  These little drives are totally up to date with USB connectibility, and cost next to nothing.  I've been grateful to have carried one (a Sony) in my briefcase for many years.  This one was purchased for an associate who needed to transfer files from an older commercial graphics machine to alternate locations.",5
Easy to install (just plug it in) and you have instant floppy. I have a few old photo disks that I wanted to copy the files off of and no computer with a floppy disk. Very inexpensive but well constructed and works great.,5
"EASY HOOK UP,DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPPOSED TO DO.THE PRICE IS NICE TOO!A LOT OF US 'OLD TIMERS' STILL GOT STUFF ON FLOPPYS.",5
"Company replaced the item. So I raised the rating to 3 stars.  It makes keeping track of the CAC convenient. The company makes one that is better constucted. Recommend buying that one,",3
"Easy hook up --- just plug and play.  Now that non of the newer computers have a floppy drive, I thought it was important to get a drive before they stop making them.  I have a lot of old photos and documents stored on floppies and no way to access them, until I got this drive.  I like it so well that I will probably order another one.",5
"Cleaning out my office after an almost 3 decade career I ran across dozens of old 1.44mb floppies.  Recalling that I had used several for photos in one of the original Panasonic digital cameras I decided I had better take a look before I tossed them in the recycle bin.  Unfortunately my current computers both at work and at home no longer have floppy disk readers, so the Sabrent External USB reader was an easy solution.  GLAD I did because I found several photos I had forgotten I had.  I have other Sabrent products:  USB3 SD and Micro SD card reader and a USB2 external sound card.  All three work as intended.",5
"I never thought i would need to look at a floppy drive again, but lo and behold, a customer had some very important data stored on some very old floppies.  This saved his data and his price can't be beat.  Not a bad addition to have for your toolkit for that rainy day.",5
"Does as advertised, performs well. Worked flawlessly right out of the box. Everything needed was already present in my Wintendo 7 install.",4
"The delivery was prompt, the item was packed well and the floppy disk drive was plug and play as advertised.  I simply plugged into my computer using the Windows 7 program and the drive self loaded the software which took approximately 1 minute.  It was ready to use.  I was able to transfer my pictures from the floppy disks to CD's enabling me to view my old pictures which I hadn't seen for a long while.  I would, at this point, recommend the Sabrent external floppy disk drive as I am very satisfied with the product.",5
"Arrived on time, in good shape, and works without hassle on Windows 7.......... we need 3.5 for our business machines and this fits the bill.",5
I had a bunch of photo disks that I wanted to upload. And this product fit the billInstallation was plug and play - and the product worked flawlessly.,4
It works fine.  Just plug it into a USB port and it will allow me to access old floppy disks.,5
I still have some floppies that I need to look at occasionally.  This device makes that possible.  It seems to work with any PC,5
"My new computer has no 3.5 inch floppy drive, but I still have several such floppy disks with data I wanted to retrieve.  This disk drive read the floppies just fine so I could save the data directly to the computer.This drive is a little slow, but it gets the job done.  For the price, it's a great and very useful buy!",4
I used this external floppy disk drive to recover some photos and documents that I had from back in the DOS and Windows 3.1 days.  It read my disks just fine and I was able to transfer everything to my new system.,5
"When you need a floppy disk for an older computer to update BIOS, this works great.  Portable, Windows and the BIOS saw the device without any problem.  No brainer purchase if you are going to work on older computers.",4
"Works well on both OSX and Windows 7, haven't tried it on Linux yet.  Now I remember how slow floppy disks were....",4
"Works well, for the price. Occasional miss read. Unplug and try again fixes the problem. Just was trying to recover some old files I found. Did the job. Cheap enough.",4
"TheSabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV) Blackis a totally Plug and Play device which operates perfectly under Microsoft Windows 7 (x86 and x64), and also gives the user a straightforward way to boot up modern PCs from diskettes, provided that the unit is connected directly to the motherboard, with no intermediate hubs, i.e. the drive MUST be connected to the USB ports on the back of the PC in order to be bootable.NOTE:  When using the drive under Microsoft Windows 7, sometimes a prompt will come up saying that the diskette is not formatted and asking the user to format it.  If you know the disk might have useful data on it, cancel the prompt and open up the Windows Explorer (Windows Key+E) to let Windows reread the disk contents, and voil&agrave;, the disk contents will be presented promptly in the Explorer window.  I am pretty sure this behavior is due to Windows 7, not the drive, since using it under XP didn't exhibit the symptom and, certainly, booting the PC from the same diskettes (which I've already done) wouldn't be possible if the drive couldn't read the disk.",5
"I bought this to use for work and works great, I've had no problems and I like that its plug and play.",5
Everyone in a while I get a customer that needs/wants to read old floppy disks.This drive is great for the money and installs in windows 7 and 8 without drivers.Good drive!,5
"I bought this to transfer very old floppy files to a thumb drive. I plugged the USB drive into a Windows 7 64bit computer and it was immediately recognized.  This was a one-off transfer, it worked and I won't use it again. Dealing with a floppy made me appreciate modern data storage. God love anyone still using floppies...they have the patience of a saint. File transfers are slow because of the old technology, not the drive. The 4th star was for the easy plug and play, otherwise my rating is a neutral 3.",4
I received a defective one the first time and it would take forever to load any file or it wouldn't load it at all.  So we contacted the company through amazon and they sent us another one free of charge.  The second one works just fine and have not had any problems with it.  It is nice being able to save all my old files on a computer and not having to lose them.  It also works great for if you want to install an old operating system on another computer that doesn't accept floppy disk.,4
I plugged it into my computer and... nothing. Tried it in several different computers (windows 7 and windows 8) and the device is completely dead. Will not be recognized by computers. The worst part is I cannot return it as of a few days ago. I would recommend trying a different brand.,1
"Plugged it in, popped in a disk and in a couple seconds the disk appeared on the desktop. Shockingly Mac OS still has actual icons for a floppy disk built in.Highly recommended if you need to dump some old files off floppies.The only minor downside is it makes a hum/whine while idle with a disk in it. I guess that's the price you pay for 2x the RPM.",5
"Works as expected and is nice considering that even if you have an old floppy, newer motherboards don't have the connector anymore.",5
"1 Star because it doesn't work.Apple: 2013 iMac - drive won't even register, just clicks away.Apple: 2009 MacBook Air - same as above.MS Windows 7 on a 2012 Acer laptop:Pulled up directions at mfr. website. FL-UDRV model number not found - it's under SBT-UFDB. Anyway, plugged drive in; Windows 7 installed the driver; checked to ensure it &#34;mounted&#34;.  I even had Windows search for an updated driver. Nope, the current one is good. Then the fun: inserted a 1.44MB floppy disk with data; the drive did not activate any Windows &#34;window&#34; like a CD/DVD does. I had to bring up Windows Explore to view the drive. Clicked on it, the drive actuated - click, spin, zoom, zing, the green status bar showed progress! But alas, Message Window! This disk in the drive is not formatted. Wow. Eject. Insert blank floppy with the tab set to unlock. Again, had to select from the Explore window. Again, click, spin, zoom, zing. Oops, disk needs to be formatted. Select Okay. Now it was hummin'. Windows green status bar once again showing progress - the drive is spinning - green light on - then stop. Then a new window pops up with formatting options. All fields looked correct so I selected the Format button. One more time for click, spin, zoom, and zing. Then stop. New window - Windows cannot format the drive. Several attempts followed to get this thing to work. Shut down the PC. Booted with the drive connected - no dif. Tried different USB ports - no dif.MS Windows 8 on a 2013 Toshiba laptop:See above.I'm not sure what's up with Sabrent and their models. I purchased the FL-UDRV. There is no manual on their website for it. There is for the SBT-UFDB, though. I took a chance on a product that had 22% negative reviews (39 out of 174 were 2 stars and below).  The SBT-UFDB fares no better with 61 out of 197 reviews rated 2 stars and below. That's 31%!  Guess I'll keep looking.Bottom line - it's going back.",1
"Buried deep within the User Manual (available online at Sabrent's web site) is the troubleshooting observation that you MUST wait &#34;one full minute&#34; (use a timer) between plugging it in and inserting a 1.44 MB floppy (it does NOT support ANY other density).Follow that directive and the device will work pretty much like any ordinary floppy.Before reading that directive, I was about to join those who swore the device would not work at all. It had repeatedly failed to read ANY floppy. The only other problem I've encountered (in only 1 hour of testing) is that the device driver (written by Microsoft) hung on one occasion, requiring a reboot to resolve.I would also note that the User Manual available online is for a Teac drive while the drive they sent me is a Mitsumi drive. That said, the Teac User Manual seems entirely applicable to the Mitsumi drive. But, if you search the Sabrent web site for the model number of the Mitsumi drive (FL-UDRV), you will find (at this time) no information on that model number at all.",4
"No problems with the drive, delivered as promised, good price.  This really has saved me as I have some old 3 1/2 diskettes that have photos on them and no working machines with a drive to read them.",5
"I was talking with a friend last week about computers and the conversation got onto floppy disk drives and how no one uses them any more. However, and old timer like me has many files still on floppy discs, both 3.5 inch and a few 5 1/4 inch. That got me to thinking about what I could do about them. I have an OLD FDD/multi-card reader that the card reader works with Windows 7 64-bit but the FDD won't. So I searched Amazon and came across the Sabrent. I read the customer ratings,as I always do, and saw that many people said it worked with their Windows 7 and even Windows 8. So I ordered it, received it, plugged it in and within a few seconds Windows 7 64-bit said it was ready for use. I popped in a FD and heard the old familiar whirring noise. I double-clicked on Computer and there it was! I double-clicked on it and heard the drive reading the disk and saw my files display.How weird the young ones would have probably thought if they'd seen my face when it worked.Now I don't have to worry about the hundreds of floppy discs that I have not been able to read for the last few years.I haven't tried it with the low-density discs as I don't think I have any. I learned long ago to just buy the 1.44 MB discs as they were more cost-effective.Now to copy the discs to my computer and then back them up to CD/DVD/External HDD.NOTE: Nothing on the package mine came in says it's compatible with any particular version of Windows. It only shows &#34;Windows PC Compatible&#34;, &#34;Mac OS X Compatible&#34;, USB 1.1/2.0/3.0 compatible and hot swappable.Now, about the 5.25 inch discs....",5
"If you have old 3.5&#34; floppies laying around but don't want to toss them before checking the content, this drive is absolutely perfect.  Just plug it into any USB slot and Windows Explorer will see the drive without any drivers, and it even works from the from the front USB slots.  I've tried it on a WinXP system and on a Windows 7 64-bit system, and it works perfectly on both to read and write to the floppies.The price is great as well.  I have some old internal floppy drives still, but motherboards no longer come with the connection for them, unless you want to install a 3rd party card to connect it, all of which would be much pricier than the cost of this drive.",5
This unit seems to work great. I was able to read all but three of my 50 floppy discs. Not sure why the three wouldn't read. Might be their age. But the Sabrent Floppy drive was great. It worked from the USB power.,4
"It works and it doesn't. The product itself works and yes it works with the Operating Systems but it didn't work for my needs. I had old floppies from and XP machine and wanted to get data back. With this I kept getting a message that there was no data on the floppy disks which I knew not to be the case (yes, I'm aware of degradation of floppy drives over time). I did some research and determined the issue was that the hardware is too knew so it doesn't recognize some of the older floppy disks.I managed to find an old machines with and internal floppy drive and did get the data off the floppy disks. All but 2 of the disks resulted in data retrieval. So while this actually works (drivers install, shows up as a valid drive, etc.) it really doesn't. Most anyone purchasing this is trying to get data off old floppies which this didn't do for me.",3
"I thought for the price it would be a complete kit. It's OEM! It's just a bare drive, no cable, no driver, manual - nothing. If you know what you're doing or are replacing an old floppy it'll do, but you can find bare drives for a much much cheaper price elsewhere. They should put that it's OEM in the description.",3
"Never thought I would actually buy a floppy drive in this day and age, but when a friend came to me, asking for help with stacks of floppies that contained baby pictures taken with a Sony Mavica back in the day....I did.  Discs would not read at all in any of the 5 XP computers at work that still had floppy drives....errors and &#34;format disc?&#34; options....but no reading what so ever.Bought this and plugged it up to my Win 8 machine....and first disc read like a charm.  Other discs popped errors, but after reinserting/opening 2-3 times, all would eventually read, and I was able to retrieve 190 of a total 215 pictures from the stacks of discs.Can't say I will ever use it again, and it DID take a little wrangling and a lot of time...BUT $14 isn't much to spend to retrieve priceless memories from 15 yr old floppies no other drive would read.  Money well spent.",4
"I like this product.  Just know that if you have labels on the floppy disk, more than one, the disk will get stuck on ejection.  The tolerance is too tight in that regard.",3
"This review is for the Sabrent USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV) Black.  It's a well built, quality floppy disk drive that comes with a hardwired USB 2.0 cable for connection to the computer.  There's really not much to say except that it works ---- simple setup, plug and wait for drivers to load and install --- then use the drive.  How hard is that?",5
"It doesn't work with DD disks, only HD disks. We had a few of the former and we had to decide to just give up on them.It mounted fine on a macbook, and even transferred our old System 7 mac disks.We did get a defective one first, but Amazon replaced it quickly enough.",3
Works well and allowed me to transfer all old data off floppy.  Now I can get rid of old computer.,5
"*  It is indeed plug and play...I just plugged it into the USB on my Lenovo laptop (Windows 7).  I was able to view every file on numerous floppy disks.*  Great price.  If you have some old, old floppies around, I recommend getting this little beauty.  You might have some wonderful old files/memories you had forgotten about on those floppies.",5
I plugged the drive in and my Win 7 PC indicated it was downloaded a driver.  After that I could read and writes files just fine.  It does have an annoying habit of refusing to eject disks with labels on them.  I've had to simultaneously hold the eject button and extract the disk with tweezers.,3
This is a well made floppy drive that has no apparent issues that could have crossed paths with me or the application I put it in.,5
work great,5
was terrible did auto connect and was complete waste if time thanks for telling it doesnt always work good going,1
"Worked out of the box with my MacBook ProDoes not eject with computer command, must manual ejectNOISY - with no disk in it sits there and &#34;thunks&#34; loudly about once a second (which means I will keep it unplugged until I need it) which is a pain since I was setting up a USB hub to make easy plug-in.  (With a disk in it it is quiet, but not sue how happy it will be when pull the hubs USB from the computer)Have only tried reading",3
"Works very well.  Not the greatest sound but it's just the thing for patio parties, etc.  Make sure to read the manual first.",4
"Excellent purchase for the price I paid.  Works great sending signal from my computer to outdoor location (approximately 50 feet through a wall with window).  It is a little testy when I first turn it on, often requiring slight adjustments to the tuning to find the proper signal frequency.  Every once in a while I think uncontrollable outside static also causes issues, requiring me to readjust the frequency on the transmitter and receiver.  But once working, I've rarely had to make adjustments--and it plays just fine for hours.I have not used batteries yet, so I do not know the life when playing music without AC plug-in.  But overall, it has been an excellent purchase and far simpler than wiring outdoor speakers, at least for now.",4
"Wish I read the reviews here more completely. This was a complete piece of trash. Like with others, the speaker would not play for more than 30 seconds at a time no matter what I did. After a while I could feel that the speaker was over heating so I left it unplugged. Sure enough it came back and played for another 30 seconds and then quit. It's going back to Amazon immediately!",1
"I wouldn't waste my time on this product.  The range isn't nearly what was advertised.  It says 150 feet, but I can barely get them to work across the room.  It's even worse in a two-story house.  God forbid if you want to have the transmitter downstairs and the speaker upstairs or outside.  They are prone to hissing and popping and my set has an annoying, high-pitched whine.  Even the slight motion can interfere with the signal. I should have returned them when I had the chance.",1
Just hooked it up and it works great. We've got the Reds game on the television inside and the audio coming through the speaker outside so we won't miss anything! So far so good.,5
"The sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction. The wireless system,  however is pretty bad. In an urban area you might be able to get 20', but even then you'll get periodic interference. In a more rural setting it becomes moderately usable, with more like 40' and fewer blasts of junk.",2
"On the first try the outdoor speaker played for 30 seconds then stopped working. I returned to Amazon (no charge) and got a replacement speaker. Opps, same thing, the speaker played nicely for 30 seconds and then went dead (the speaker sounded good for the brief time that it played). I emailed Amazon.com and wanted to role the dice and give it a 3rd try. Amazon responded by saying that the problem with the speaker was more widespread than originally thought and they would not be able to send me an additional one. They refunded all my money also gave me a $10 credit in my account for the hassle. I was surprised to see the same speaker still for sale on their site two weeks later especially if there is a manunfacturing defect, the speaker goes dead and they know about the issue. Should I give the speaker another try? I really did like the product if it would only work. I've searched the customer reviews and this problem is NOT isolated to me.  Well, if you order this product save the box and packaging as you might very well be returning it after 30 seconds. It seemed like a solid product but at the low price of $32.00, I'm not surprised it failed to work. Please leave feedback as I would like to order anothrer myself, but the hastle of returning defective products is a pain no matter how easy Amazon tries to make it.  Also, I wanted to mention that it was very generous of Amazon to give me a $10 credit for my troubles with the speaker... Amazon.com is a very reputable company I recommend them strongly and I will continue to buy many prodcuts from them now and in the future.  Best of luck with this one.",1
"I love the digital music channels provided through my cable TV service, and I wanted to be able to listen to this music outside. I just got so sick of dragging the boom box outside during dinner parties or while gardening and then having to fuss with changing CDs--especially when I had great music playing inside the house.The speaker has exceeded my expectations. If you read the directions carefully and follow them step-by-step, you'll have good sound outdoors, too. I was up and running with tunes oustide within ten minutes. I needed another five minutes to fine tune, which was easily accomplished by reading the instructions and the troubleshooting guide. (If you refuse to read instructions or to show a little patience, you get what you deserve.)Contrary to what you may have read in other reviews, if the unit is set up correctly, the sound is NOT thin. The bass is substantial and even with the volume set to maximum, there is no distortion. I set up the speaker (loud!) and strolled my entire yard perimeter, as well as the far side of my neighbor's yard, and could hear everything perfectly. I used the cordless phone right next to the unit--no problem. The distance from my stereo to the backyard is the entire depth of the house--about 60 feet--with signal passing through several plaster and brick walls. I found that it's important to place the transmitter up as high as you can. That solved the few little sound problems I had at setup. What can I say? It sounds great and I love it.",5
"I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this unit was to set up.  Within 5 minutes, I had the unit set up and playing on my back patio.  No static or distortion on CD or radio once I &quot;tuned&quot; in the box.  Unit sounded great with a balanced mix of bass and treble.  Make sure that the speaker is sheltered outside since the instructions explicitly state that it will not handle excessive rain or wet weather!",5
"Although I own two indoor Advent wireless speakers which are excellent, this one is horrible. Constant static whether from a radio or CD. It has trouble tuning to the stereo although it used the same transmittor(755)as my indoor speakers. Actually it was closer to the stereo. But it never held a static-free sound regardless of position. I am going to buy a third indoor speaker, use it on the screen porch and occasionally on the deck. Much better sound with speaker and tweeter.",1
"Being able to enjoy music with a wireless speaker is fantastic. The speaker is small enough to be innocuous but delivers pretty good quality sound. On occasion, especially very humid days, it's harder to get the receiver to pick up the signal, but overall we're happy with the product.If you can buy the speaker at a deep discount, like we did, then you'll be happy with the product.",4
"Works fine for my purpose, a wireless speaker I can move wherever I want to listen to my main stereo.  I use it in the kitchen and by the pool, which are not wired for my stereo.  Sounds about as good as an inexpensive boom box and has a good range.",5
"And look for another wireless speaker, because unless you are overwhelmed and enraptured by the audio quality delivered by a ""Close and Play"" or an eight track, you will be disappointed.  And this is shocking, because usually ADVENT MAKES GREAT SPEAKERS.To give you a sense of perspective, realize that I do not demand or own ultra-high end components.  My entire set-up cost less than 1500 dollars (includes: amp, 6 cd changer, dvd player and 2 boston acoustic floor speakers).I purchased the AW810 unit to play light jazz or rock (I'm over 30 -- ouch!), out on my deck.  I thought it would help take the edge off the day (the music, along with an extra dry martini).  Instead of being smoothed by the hip-cat sounds of Miles Davis or The Dead, I found myself constantly running to the speaker to retune it (oftentimes causing me to spill my drink -- ouch again!).Net/net:1) Sound is thinner than a razor blade2) Range is abysmal -- and you actually have to ""tune"" the speaker to get reception3) My unit turned orange after being exposed to sunlight for a week (I'm not kidding!)4) The volume of this unit can be drowned out by a snoring cricket5) This speaker simply does not meet the high standards that Advent has set for their other speakers",1
"Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.  For the first hour or so, I was extremely frustrated with this product.  I tried changing the frequency, the volume of the transmitting speaker, and the location of the wireless speaker a few times, with no luck, no sound.  After some fiddling it would transmit sound for about one second and then go silent.  It finally sounded like it had blown.  It got very loud, very staticky (sp?), and then went silent.  The power light turned on and off.  It did this about three times.  I was about to give up.  I gave it one more go, and it worked!!!  I kept the frequency, and even moved the speaker a couple of times to see how it would operate.  It is still working.  It is not a high end speaker, but for the price, and what I am using it for.  I am very pleased.  It does what I bought it for.",4
"If you are looking for the best camcorder in the market, stop looking this little toy has it all. The quality of the picture and sound are so great the you will feel and see every thing that you filmed as if you where there  LIVE again. If you have a home theatre system with Adobe Digital 5.1 you  will really see what I mean. The only down side is you will need a battery  that lasts longer and make sure you get more tape.",5
"I've played with this digital camcorder for about 5 days now and I am delighted with it's quality and features. If anyone's disappointed with the quality of the video (see reviews below), they are probably being  unrealistic in their expectations. To get better video, you'd have to go up  to a 3CCD camera (at about 3times the cost!). As for those who say that the  camera is too big and heavy, I say just TRY shooting a still video without  a tripod with a camera as small as a paperback book! You NEED something  larger to get a good steady picture (even with &quot;steadyshot&quot;). I  appreciate Sony's innovative digital 8 because the tapes are less  expensive, but you still have the quality of digital recording (the Pauses  are terrific!). I'm not worried that these tapes are not interchangeable  with the mini-DV format. I mean, how often would I want to trade digital  tapes with someone? I also have the option of playing back any old 8 or  hi-8 videotapes that were previously recorded, and converting them to  digital (try THAT with a mini-DV camcorder)! I like having A/V outputs AND  inputs so that I can digitally record from a source other than the camera  lens. The Sony infrared &quot;nightshot&quot; is astounding. It's like have  nightvision goggles for your camcorder! The LCD screen on the TRV310 is  WONDERFUL... 3.5 inches! The 20X optical zoom is sufficient, and going  partway into the digital zoom ain't too bad either (as long as you don't  try to actually use the full 360X!) I cannot say enough good things at this  point. If I have to find something negative to say, I wish some of the  controls were in easier locations to get to while I'm still filming. All in  All, a nifty camcorder that I HIGHLY recommend!",4
"I have had this camcorder for 4 years and I am still happy with the purchase.For myself being a big guy, I was never comfortable with the tiny MiniDV camcorders out there, and the size of the Digital8 camcorders is a nice fit in my hands, without being too large and heavy for my wife to use comfortably.I have not had much chance to do comparison testing, but the picture quality is very good.  In some cases I might think the color is a bit undersaturated, but I prefer this to seeing colors pushed beyond what they should be.  I have no complaints about the sharpness of the video.  In very low light the picture doers become grainy; I suspect that new camcorders out there may do a better job in low light than the TRV310.One thing I really like about this camcorder today is that it seems better built than the Digital8 models than Sony is currently producing.  In addition, the lens is a bit larger on the early Digital8 models, so low light performance may actually be better than the current ones (but I have not done a comparison).  I also will recommend the TRV130 for video editing; I have had no problems loading video off of the camcorder onto my Windows XP PC with a firewire cable.My complaints on the camcorder:1. Still uses tape, which can jam up inside the camcorder (luckily I havent lost a tape yet).  I've also been told specifically to use *only* Sony Hi8 / Digital8 tapes with this unit.2. There is a manual exposure setting, which is good for shooting candlelit scenes, etc.  But the camera is missing a manual white balance that I wish it had.  The white balance is done automatically when the camera is turned on; when indoors with natural light I will point the lens to a blue object at powerup to eliminate a bluish tint to the picture; likewise if the indoor scene is lit I will point at a warm-toned object to eliminate everything looking orange.3. The supplied Infolithium battery is useless.  I which Sony would include one of the larger batteries as standard.4. As mentioned above, low light performance could be better.  The low light settings the camera provides are rarely used.Altogether, I'm very happy with this camcorder.",4
"Well, I had read all the reviews of this model on Amazon and based my purchasing decision partly on this information.  I expected picture quality from the 310 to be at least as good as my old PAL Sony 8mm.  However, after  2 weeks of using the 310 we had to conclude that it simply provides  inferior picture quality in most lighting situations.  Inferior in both  colour reproduction and in clarity, whatever the technical specs. say. For  example, I have a coat with a maroon sleeve but this appeared bright red  whatever exposure or program setting I used; same with the shop model we  checked with when returning the purchased unit to the store - it didn't  appear to be just a snafu with the particular unit we had purchased.  We  also compared the 310 picture with the supposedly inferior Panasonic 910  and both colour and clarity were actually better on the latter.  Why?  What is Sony playing at?  We were expecting twice the clarity  (&quot;resolution&quot;) and 3 times the colour depth from this Digital 8  camera, as widely advertised.  What are they talking about?  When it comes  down  to it, its about picture quality, no matter what bells and whistles  the machine has.Boy, was I glad to get my money back!",2
"This must have been the best handycam for the price when I bought it! And I love the death out of it! All I can say is that this camera would still be great if it were still manufactured, 3 years later! If you find one someone who is selling this camera in good condition, by all means get it! It's a great camera!",5
This very small compact radio plays very well for its size. I am able to pick up some really distant AM stations and I am also able to pick up many shortwave stations only using the small built in telescoping antenna that it has. Performance is not as good as my larger SW and ham radios that I own but all in all I rate it very good for it size and performance. This model is no longer being produced but you may be able to locate a used one that is in descent condition.,5
"This is the only shirt pocket size shortwave radio worth buying. For this great price you get a pocket radio without any drift (meaning the station you listen to won't change to another station because of a loose or faulty dial), great stereo FM on headphones or ear buds (the buds that come with it are OK. Buy a better set and get ready for great sound), good AM reception, and Shortwave reception that is adequate for the big international broadcasts like BBC but poor for most everything else. The speaker is only good for talk radio. For music, this is a tinny and tiny speaker (about one inch wide). If you want a pocket radio that also gets BBC, Radio Canada, and Voice of America, this is the trick. Listen in on good earplugs and you will be happy with your purchase. It also has a good vinyl case. The radio looks sturdily built and will probably last for years.",4
"A great little radio. I used it on my flight from AZ to NH. The FM and AM came in just great. Not sure about the shortwave as I wasn't able to pick up anything. But then again, I didn't really try. I like the small size. Fits in my jacket pocket. A smart looking radio. Price is reasonable.CON: The ear plugs are useless. Will not stay in the ear.",5
"I supposed location is everything. Up here in Alaska, I found this radio to be rather limiting if not almost useless. Reception proves to be very weak, tuning isn't the most exact science here and quality of this radio wasn't very high. I brought this radio from REI and within a year, the speaker cover fell off (they were just glued in) and my tuner dial fell apart. Needless to say, this wasn't Grundig's finest effort.I did get good AM/PM reception within the city limits but I can do that with almost any radio. SW modes were limited, even on a clear nights, on top of a mountain. Its a weak radio, probably good in a very civilized part of the world but worthless out where you really need it. Small size is nice but why carry a radio around if you can't pick up anything once the city lights are no longer in sight??",1
I purchased one of these radios to listen to AM talk radio while commuting. The AM reception is 'good' but not great. It takes some getting used to the backwards tuning dial which goes high to low which is the opposite of most other radios. What I like best about it is that it is very small & sturdy. I believe I have had the same batterys in it for over a year now and have not had to replace them. It does not get heavy use as I said earlier the reception is not what I had hoped but still gets several hours every week of play time.,3
It's a very good radio for emergencies and Grundid is an excellent name. I also believe it was on sale. It works fine and I recommend it Highly.,5
"I've used this product for about an hr now and its going back.Can't stand its sound quality - one tone, shrill sound. Hurts my ears.Stay away from this one!!",1
"This is my first shortwave radio.  So, not having anything to compare it to, this is a good radio.  On the AM/FM side, I am hearing radio stations I didn't know were available.  On the shortwave end, I am amazed what is coming in.  In the short time I've owned this, I've heard Bolivia, Cuba, and either French Canada or some other french speaking nation, as well as many spanish speaking stations.  If nothing else, this is a good ""beginner"" radio.  Yes, the reception on the SW side are a smidge in and out, but it's ok.  At this point I am just in amazement at what I am able to hear.  There may be better radios out there; as I delve into this more, maybe I'll get them.  But this is good for me just starting out and is fairly easy to figure out.",4
"Looking just at the features, this is a good unit to get for a basic, portable AM/FM/SW receiver.  It has a good digital tuner, decent reception, an external antenna option for pulling in weak signals, etc.  However the design of the unit has several short comings.The biggest by far is that it uses up the batteries when turned off!  Leave it on the shelf, and in a few weeks it'll be dead.  To add insult to the injury, all the features that require memory (channels, alarms) are lost when the batteries die.The second is the construction is not very sturdy.  The grill popped off of mine after a few months of regularly toting it around.  And the telescoping antenna - like all - is a failure waiting to happen (and it did).I'm looking for a unit that has comparable features, but is more sturdy, has better power management, and non-volatile memory.",2
"This radio is a great value in a PLL-digitally-tuned radio.  It is being phased out in favor of the Eton/Grundig E100.  These days there has been a trend for analog-tuned radios with digital frequency counters like the Grundig 350 field radio.  While these radios are easy to tune and bandscan, they do not have any memory presets and the tuning drifts after a few hours based on temperature and humidity.  The Grundig YB300PE, on the other hand, is a true digital radio and has 24 memories.  The memories are a boon for FM/AM listeners like me who like to ""channel surf"" during the long 12-minute commercial breaks on Howard Stern and the Don & Mike show.  The direct frequency input is unheard of at this price, especially for a Grundig.  Granted, this radio is no longer made in Taiwan but mainland China (the box actually says ""QUALITY PRODUCT MADE IN CHINA"" in big letters, possibly in response to the reviews it gets in the Passport to World Band Radio book).The extras that are included with this radio cost almost as much as the radio itself: a quality AC adapter that doesn't introduce that annoying 60 Hz hum, a reel antenna, a carrying case, earbuds, and a lanyard that is actually really handy (the radio is much smaller than you might imagine from the pictures).  It runs on 3 AA batteries for what seems like forever in FM, and only a little shorter when always in AM or shortwave (cheap off-brand AA batteries are included).I can't really say that the speaker is useful for those who want to hear music but those folks are better off with the YB400PE, the larger cousin of this unit, or even Sony ICF-SW7600G.  No single-sideband is available but if you're serious about something like that you won't be buying a radio at this price, anyway.Overall a good radio for AM and FM digital preset channel surfers like me and the occasional jaunt into shortwave.  A great clock radio for travelling, too.",4
"My Grundig 300PE was a Christmas gift, 2009. One week later, it wouldn't turn on.(PLEASE NOTE THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW... MY FULL REVISION AND EXPLANATION IS FOUND BELOW, UNDER THE ASTRIX ...)I've installed new batteries and it won't work on the external power source either. The ""light"" works, but nothing else will power up.This is frustrating, and sadly Grundig when it was a product made in Germany, was an outstanding line of radios. Now that they are made in China, there is no reliability in the products.I'd suggest ""buy at your own risk"" and understand that this radio has a short shelf-life.The audio quality (while typical for a radio having a speaker this small) was GOOD. It had an easy time receiving a signal inside my home in a rural area, miles away from FM transmitters. My old Sony portable radio (which I purchased and took to Russia in 1989 in order to get shortwave broadcasts from the USA) finally died after 20 years. The Grundig (when it worked) never performed as well as my Sony (made in Japan)but I wasn't too disappointed with the performance of Shortwave listening on this tiny radio. The Sony would hold a station better and not drift as bad as the Grundig and the Sony had vastly superior audio, despite having a speaker about the same size as the Grundig.******* UPDATE.  This Grundig radio EASILY ""dies"" often after being powered off and left to sit idle for a few days. I thought a component had gone bad inside the radio and I was about to shoot a video to post on YouTube showing a hammer crushing the darned thing because it ""died.""  However, I have been able to get this radio to working again (on several occasions) by pulling the cover off where the batteries go and discovering on my own, that there is a very VERY tiny reset button under the batteries. It has to be reset with a toothpick or a paper clip. When I reset the radio, it's like it comes back from the dead and works. But that being said, resetting this little monster is a frequent chore.",3
"This radio has very good sensitvity to FM, MW and Shortwave.  Its sensitivity is almost as good as my Grundig 400PE, but some of the other specs aren't quite as good which I would expect for a receiver that is  about half the price of the 400 PE.  Its power consuption is better than  the 400 PE too.  It's smaller size (than the 400 PE), very good designed,  easy to use controls, good sound quality along with an excellent read out  offers a good value.  I like this radio's abliliy to quickly get to the  frequency I am interested in.  This is a fine little radio--- four stars.",4
"This radio has good sound for a radio this small with verylittle overload on FM. Not quite as selective as the Yacht Boy 400, but good. Better than the Sangean 220 and my Sony walkman.The AM is good for nighttime listening, but daytime listeninghas some interference. The shortwave reception is average, even though it doesn't cover all the bands. The thing I like most about this radio is that it's easy to carry around.",3
"Hello folks its Vince the radioman. I have been a collector and a buff for many years , love to do compares . This radio is generally ok no major complaints . The tuner quality is good ( although you can only tune down to a 5kh increment). Much better quality than the G2000a.  The sound is a bit brassy but clear. Its a good little travel radio and for the casual user its certainly worth the money .I would rate this better than its competitor the Sangean ATS 404 . It has a little bit of a better tuner , better at noise reduction and it has an external ant. jack which is always a plus . Not the best radio for DXers because of the 5kh increment but you can still get some fairly decent results . Grundigs construction quality leaves a bit to be desired ( be careful its delicate!!) but all in all not a bad little radio . If you get a sale buy it.",3
"Absolutely fantastic, my recorder stopped formatting my DVD-Ram disks. I had used the recorder approximately 1 yr, After using Maxell's DVD cleaner disk, all is back to normal. Great product even a simpleton can use it, follow on screen instructions and you are home free.",5
It works for me . It also has a few extras such as audio/video tests . I don't have any complaints .,4
I purchase Maxell products because they works. Needed to clean the old DVD player. Put the disc in and followed instructions. Simple as that.,5
"Did exactly as it is advertised. Be aware, however, that there is only one (tiny) brush on the disk. Other brands have a few, or many (if that matters to you). I've always had good luck with Maxell.",4
"I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended.",5
Works great...For what I'm using it for it works good. I liked the excellent price...I would tell friends about this product.,5
"It is easy and comfortable to wear, not sure if it was just my product or so is made in general, but the cleaner disc is not fully adjusted to where the optical pickup lens is located (by just two millimeters), and I can not taste good if it fulfills its job well.",3
"I bought this as a cheap fix for my Polk DVD/CD player, which refused to play disks that worked on other machines (lots of screen freezes).  I inserted the cleaner per instructions, followed the instructions on screen but it failed to complete the cleaning process.  Ejected, tried again, same thing.  On the third go, the cycle was completed.  Unfortunately, DVDs continue to freeze.  So, maybe the Polk is a dud.  In any case, the cleaner didn't fix it and it's tough to know which product is faulty.",3
This disc could not be read in either of my DVD players.  Refund requested.  Would not pruchase this item.  Do not buy!,1
I was in desperate need of a DVD lens cleaner. This is great. I was expecting something with more dust fibers attached. The wispy few fibers manufactured with the disc perform admirably.,5
"560D: This is my first review of any product on AMZN.  I had to add a comment after reading the other reviews.  I AM NOT ALONE!!  These errors have been a continual headache, and from what I see from the reviews, turning to Sony will be to no avail.  Ah well, Sony has lost a DVD customer.  I have the Wega which is a great picture so I'm not uniformly prejudiced against Sony products.  And the DVD player when it has worked has been great. But the hitches have increased in frequency until lately I simply get No disc error.  The reader scans back and forth for about 20 seconds until it gives up.  And I'm giving up, too.  I am very surprised that a lot of people have this same problem... points to a generalized issue which I hope Sony can take care of.",1
"For anyone who wants to have total control over what you're DVD movies look and sound like, this is the unit for you. Although the picture and sound are stunning.  If you feel the need to make them even better, The 550  gives you virtualy unlimited control.  And it will save the settings for  two hundred discs.  Just pop the movie in and all your adjustments are  recalled.  But beware if you are moving to DVD after years with a VHS that  flashed 12:00, opt for a simpler player.  Otherwise, you will be paying for  a something that you can't control.  The Sony 330 will deliver fantastic  picture and sound, for $150 less.  And, as far as the sync problems that  many have reported, I have had the player for two weeks now and have had no  problems what so ever.  Even after checking out many of the reported  problem scenes listed in other reviews.  DVD is the future of home video.  Don't take my word, just look around yourself.  If you're ready to buy,  don't wait.  You won't regret it for a minute.",5

"Let me get right to the point.  When this DVD player was working, it worked well.  Good picture quality, reliable service, reasonable remote.  WHEN it worked...Unfortunately, this particular generation of Sony products falls victim to Sony's perplexing high failure rate and infant mortality problems.  After only six months of very moderate use, suddenly the unit refused to play newer DVDs (instead, displaying an &quot;Insert Disc&quot; message).  Soon thereafter, we got the dreaded &quot;C:13&quot; error on the screen and front panel of the player, indicating that the unit had essentially failed.  Now, I can play a few older, single-layer DVDs, but not newer dual-layer DVDs.  In researching the C:13 error via Google, it appears that Sony refuses to recognize the MASSIVE number of people experiencing this problem.  Now, it appears that some class-action lawsuits may be headed Sony's way from some very upset customers.  I am certainly one of them.So, caveat emptor.  Sony certainly is an innovative company, but their quality control and longevity engineering is woeful as evidenced by the huge number of failures experienced by this product.  Thus, I offer a resounding one star for poor performance by Sony.",1
"The Sony DVD-S550 is a great buy for first and second time DVD player buyers alike. It offers a tremendous combination of features and performance at a very reasonable price.  I had a year and a half old Panasonic DVD player that decided to stop working and I realize now that it  really did me a favor.  Seeing and hearing movies on this Sony has really  opened my eyes and ears to all that DVDs can offer. I mention ears because  as amazing as the video quality is, the sound quality is what really blows  me away (and you don't need a humongous sound system to appreciate it). You  will not be disappointed by this product! It provides very near the quality  level of the Sony Reference DVD-S7700 (at half the price) and features  (inc. a jog dial remote) that put it over the Sony DVD-S530 (at least in my  book).",5
"I asked around to some friends before buying a DVD, and was recommended the 550D multiple times. the higher end models only give you changer control (multiple dvd's/cd's) but since i already have a cd changer, i  didn't need to pay for that functionality. I have never had any issues with  audio track and video track being out of sync, in fact it has worked  perfectly. the remote control is intuitive, with multiple rewind and ff  speeds. The slow motion also has multiple speeds, so you can go frame by  frame with the jog function, or the system can move forward very very  slowly front or back. full features, digital menus, most of the controls  can also be done from the console of th machine itself. I play cd's in it  all the time as well. Optical jacks and svid and coax, really offer  flexibility when connecting to your stereo system.  I especially like the  built in dts decoding and dolby digital outputs. Very nice system!",5
"I've had nothing but trouble with Sony DVD players. This one's audio gets out of sync with the picture after the layer switch on dual-layer DVDs. My previous one, Sony's PBD-V30, couldn't play the second layer of any DVD  without skipping. I took that one back and the dealer couldn't get  replacement parts from Sony. I love Sony's design and features, but I  wonder about their quality anymore.",3
"Generally speaking, I love sony products... however, I have found that when they need to be repaired, they are never good for long.  Case in point was my purchase of this DVD player.  It broke after 3 months with a C:13 error.  I took it in, and they shipped it back to me 2 weeks later.  It then broke 1 1/2 months in the exact same way.  I took it in, and it was fixed for 6 months before breaking in the exact same way.  It was out of warranty this time, but because it had been defective so many times they fixed it.  Well, you guessed it.  Now it is broken again.When the machine works, it is great.  But it has broken too many times for my tastes.",1
"I don't know about the rest of you but I have been researching products to allow me to play music for about 2 months and I've had a hard time making a decision.  I've looked a mp3, minidisc, and regular cd players.  I finally chose to jump in and buy this mainly because I didn't want the mp3 craze to pass me by :^).  Here's what I think:Styling:  Look good.  It is almost exactly the size of a cigarette box but the depth is about 3/4 less.  The clippable pouch that comes with it is okay but you need to undo the velcro tie to turn it on and completely pull it out to vary the volume.  The pouch is quite cushion-any and probably saved me when I dropped it.  It does feel and look durable.  The blue backlit screen looks attractive.  The mp3 file names scroll across the screen rather slowly but, again, a minor point.Sound:  Apart from the miserable headphones (my main problem was static as the headphone jack swiveled around the entry socket) the sound is good to great.  I wasn't looking for &quot;knock your socks off&quot; sound anyway but I am quite happy with it.  The highest volume setting is not as loud as I'd like it but it doesn't bother me to any great extent.Loading music:  Loading is quick thru the USB port.  I use  RealJukebox Plus (the one that costs money) along with an add-on to manage music loading and I am very happy with it.  I didn't like the Rio Audio Manager but it works fine.  Setup was a piece of cake.  Very intuitive and fast.Memory:  64MB allows me to place almost any CD I have in memory.  I have a mixture of 128KBS and 192KBS sampling rates on my mp3s and at 192 a single CD is about all that fits on there.  The expansion port for memory upgrades will come in handy.Overall:  Nothing really to complain about.  A nice little gadget that I'm very happy with.",4
"Two quick negatives about this machine:1. Documentation is terrible. You'll be hard pressed to find even the most basic instructions in the manual.2. Software is buggy and will cause your system to lock up on  occasaion.The player itself is very good. I would also suggest looking  at the Rave MP2100 MP3 player before you make up your mind.Though this is a  neat little machine, I am not sure that the USB option works as fast as  it's touted in the promotional literature. Recommended with some  hesitation.",4
"The Rio 500 is a great MP3 player. It has all the features I wanted, pretty good battery life, and is a perfect size.PROS:-Basic, easy to use interface.-Decent battery life, although not as long as the manufacturer claims.CONS:-I hate the software interface. It is slow, unstable and poorly designed. I suggest you use Windows Media Player instead to upload files to the device.-As of firmware version 2.15 (availible from ftp://ftp.s3.com/pub/multimedia/rio/rio500_firmware_215.exe), the player only supports additional smartmedia cards of up to 64mb, to give it 128mb of total memory. Although this is a decent amount, 128mb smartmedia cards have gotten a lot cheaper....-There is no Windows XP support with the included software. It will work with XP using 3rd party software, which, consequently, is better than the included software...",4
"I still prefer my Rio 500 and have yet to &quot;upgrade&quot; to any of the newer MP3 players.  It is light, smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use.  I used it primarily to listen to Audible (audio books) while commuting and it has been flawless [with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly, with a checkerboard screen].  A quick search at Rio's website (rioworld.org) revealed a recovery utility, which I ran and recovered my Rio's firmware.  Whew!",4
"The Rio is overall a great product. The buttons and &quot;interface&quot; on the player itself are for the most part intuitive (though it took me some time to figure out the more &quot;advanced&quot; features) and are  easy to use, even when you're fumbling around in your pocket to change a  song.The fact that the player is unskipable (it's not like MiniDisc  where they SAY it doesn't skip and it really does) and extremely  lightweight makes the Rio the perfect exercise companion; I take it on  every run.For 99% of purposes, 64 megabytes memory is enough (unless  you're a fan of 256 kb encoding). I can almost always fit ten or more songs  on the player, and changing them is easy enough. So don't worry about the  memory size-it's enough.The software (I use a Macintosh) is well done  and makes it very easy to transfer songs to the player itself. The only  thing I was less than perfectly happy with was the wait while the songs  copy (in the scheme of things, a very small flaw). The USB interface was no  problem at all, even on an older, less compatible iMac (Revision A).The  headphones included with the player are neat looking, but not great  sounding. The fidelity is low, with barely any low and low-mid-range sound.  Assume you will have to spend at least another $25 for decent  ear-buds.The only feature I feel the Rio lacks is recording capabilities  like the Nomad. But again, no big deal.Overall, a great product. I'd buy  one for a friend.",4
"Simple to use, compact, one rechargable AA battery lasts more than 12 hours, great quality.  Great value.  I enjoy it everyday.",5
"In it's own world, the Rio is great.  Just an MP3 Player with 65 Meg ram.  Needs better headphones, although they feel snug and secure.  Also, it  would have been nice to have a recording feature with built in Mic or Input  for a Lapel Mic.  That would blow minidisk out of the water.  I must say  however that this is the future at its best.  No moving Parts, removable  Smart Media Cards used to expand memory.  The Future of music does not  involve any motors of any kind to spin a disk.  I've allready downloaded a  ton of online books and music, and the quality is great......and remember,  MP3's can be be converted back to a standard .Wav file with just about any  MP3 editor....Try Music Match......A great product David_Carlin@vtel.com",4
"Does not work at all on my brand new PC (98se, usb), very bad software, support is helpless... Advertised Audible format is not actually supported ('yet' they say...) Don't buy now... this is a rushed out (though late)  buggy product...",1
"I bought a Rio500 and regretted the purchase 5 minutes after opening the package.To load software from the computer to the Rio500, you use the AudioManager software that comes with your Rio. On 3 of 4 computers I tried the Rio software on, the software failed to properly interact with the Rio,  popping up a dialog saying, ""Either your Rio is busy or it has insufficient  memory. Try turning your Rio off, then on again."" A brain dead message - I  wasn't trying to copy anything to my Rio, so memory isn't an issue here.  Diamond's tech support did find a work-around that worked on 1 of the 3  failing computers, though.The reason I bought the Rio500 is because  memory is expandable using flash cards. More memory is good. Also, I have  some Compact Flash cards for my digital camera lying around. Unfortunately,  Diamond opted to call their proprietary memory card, a flash card even  though the memory is incompatible with any device using the standard  compact flash card. The only reason I can fathom for the similar name is  duplicity on Diamond's part.The other reason I bought the Diamond is for  use in the gym. I grow weary of the classic rock at Gold's and want some  Talking Heads, Lords of Acid or maybe Mozart. The carry case packaged with  the player, however, is tedious. The fabric mesh case completely obscures  access to all controls. In fact, while fumbling, I accidentally placed the  Rio into ""loop this track"" mode. How did I do this? There is no loop  button. Several minutes of inspection, between workout sets proved  fruitless. Later, after I got home and read the manual - fold out pamphlet  is more apt - I learned Diamond overloaded the use of the multi-button. Not  only does the multi-button turn, but you press it for selections. If you  have a Sony HandyCam, you know the drill. However, while in the gym, the  Rio's interface had me baffled. I blame Diamond for a bad interface.A  classic problem in the field of computer science is the knapsack problem.  The knapsack can store only some many units and given a selection of  different-sized units, the problem is to optimize how much you place into  the sack. The limited memory of the Diamond is the knapsack. Your MP3s are  the items you place into the knapsack. Unfortunately, when placing MP3s  onto the memory cards, you have to select which card the MP3 is stored upon  - either the onboard memory or the expansion. The AudioManager does not  optimize for you. Leaving you to figure out how to best use every megabyte  on your Rio. This lack of optimization is exceptionally tedious.Looking at the  specifications the Diamond Rio500 seems a winner, but after some use and  field testing, I realize terrible mistakes were made. Diamond duped me with  their illegitimate ""flash card,"" the AudioManager isn't fully baked and the  interface to the player isn't straight forward due to one button having  more than 1 function. Give this player a miss and wait for the 3rd  generation MP3 players.",2
"The Diamond Rio 500 is simply the best bet out there for anyone buying a MP3 player for the first time or buying one as a gift.  It's also far and away the best bet for Macintosh owners.As others have noted, the only  downsides are the lack of an AC adapter and the horrible headphones that  come with the unit.  This may be a bit subjective, but the design of the  unit itself is also a bit uninspiring.The unit is, however, extremely  small, light, and portable.  You won't mind taking it with you in your coat  pocket, although I'm not quite sure if it would be appropriate for jogging  (I wouldn't know where to put it).  Don't be fooled by the packaging which  is overly large and cumbersome, the device inside is smaller than it  appears.Oh, one last nitpick, battery life is pretty short.  I would  recommend using two sets of good rechargeable AA batteries, otherwise  you'll be buying new batteries every other day!The Rio is a lot like an  IBM ThinkPad.  It's perhaps not the sexiest device on the market, and it's  a little bit more costly than some other options, but it does everything a  bit better than the competition and will last (making that bit more you  spent up-front more than worthwhile).",4
"Not the smallest or best built, but not that bad. I'm not disappointed. That is more than I can say for many MP3 players.",3
"The Rio 500 holds a decent amount of music, and the battery lasts longer than I expected. But best of all, it is Mac compatible and the tranfer speed via USB is FAST! If you use SoundJam on your Mac, the interface is right through that application.",5
"The documentation to get started is sketchy at best. I almost took the unit back and thought it was flawed because I could not get it to download to the recorder. Ripping from a CD is fast, and downloading is also fast,  but it appears that battery life might be a problem since it shows  considerable use after a couple of hours. I also have a mini disk player  and will not throw this away since it is more flexible in repeating songs  and the disks aren't that big that they are a pain to carry. In essence,  the price may be a bit high, but the quality is great and the unit is nice  to carry. I am not sorry that I bought it since it is nice to download  songs right from the net. Jim",4
"Diamond/S3 has created a MAJOR dud w/ this product. I will never again purchase another Diamond/S3 product, nor will I allow someone to do so w/o hearing me out first.For starters - the box says that it's firmware is upgradeable to  support higher memory capacity at a later time.  Then after we'd already  bought it - they said they wouldn't upgrade the firmware past 32MB cards.  A huge uproar came about from all the owners since other companies were  supporting the 64MB cards.  Finally they relented.Then the new Rio's  won't support the memory cards that you buy for this product.  And memory  is the most expensive part.  There won't even be some sort of an expansion  pack - the new Rio's will use a proprietary type of memory which means you  can't use it in your PDA or Camera - and you'll pay a lot of money for it  too.Then, there product is HIGHLY bugey.  Crashing often, it has huge  battery issues.  For instance - if you're transfering data and the battery  dies then the unit has to be reset at the FACTORY.  And this happens a LOT  because unlike other USB products that are powered off the USB Bus, the Rio  drains batteries like CRAZY when transferring files.  I end up having to  put in a brand new battery every time I transfer files just because I don't  want to deal w/ a Factory Reset.The USB cable - not sold anywhere so you  can't get a replacement. You HAVE to get 3rd party software to download MP3's  to the Rio because what it comes w/ is Useless.  The CDROM it comes w/ has  3rd party software that you can only use for 30 days, thankfully MusicMatch  and RealJukebox will take care of that.The Rio500 will not be upgraded  to support some of the new codecs (WMA) which are half the size of MP3's.  The Rio600 comes w/ it - so obviously they're recognizing that this new  Codec is the way to go, but they won't support their older products.And why not?  This &quot;older&quot; product is the most current product  available by them to date.  And it's not like after shelling out $275 for a  unit,  you're willing to &quot;upgrade&quot; to another player in 6  months!Are you getting the feeling that they've upset me a bit!",1
"Wow, what a frustrating product. The technology is so tantalizing, but the realization through the Rio 500 is so bug-ridden that it drove me crazy.  I  am returning the product.  Some of the problems:o The software from  Diamond or from Audible to program the Rio is truly horrid, the worst  software I've seen in many years.  It crashes so frequently that you will  be pulling your hair out.o The documentation is a joke! The  &quot;manual&quot; is two pages long. And no, the product isn't intuitive  so you don't need a manual. Look forward to lots of trial and error as you  learn it yourself.Actually, the hardware part is OK and the sound is  joyous on those rare occasions when you can get it programmed. But for me,  the trouble overwhelms the joy.  I'll be returning mine and looking at a  Creative Nomad or some next-generation MP3 player.",1
"The player is great, small, light and easy to use. You must either use a Mac (works great with iTunes), the Riositude program (freeware, google for it)or win98. I use mine whenever Im outside:running, yardwork whatever. You'll need to replace the earbuds  but if you buy a used one do you really want to use someone else's earbuds? The serial number will rub off so write it down as another reviewer suggested.Also, if you buy a used one, make sure you get the USB cable. It's proprietary and you can't get it anywhere. (Refer to rio support coments below.)Customer support at rio (or sonic blue or whatever they call themselves this week) is a joke. I will not buy another product of any type from them ever.",4
"This is a very well designed player. It shipped without instructions of any kind (from Audible) but they are available on the web.Mine doesn't play MP3s well, they sound fuzzy and distorted. As I use mine primarily for audio books it's not a huge issue. If you get one, check it right away for playing quality. I didn't and they won't allow me to return it now.My biggest complaint is it's sensativity. If I bump it, it resets to the beginning of the audio track or song. I don't know if their other products do this but this one is awful in that regard.",3
"The RIO 500 is great for gym workouts, train listening, etc.  It's small, light and sounds good enough for listening in an environment with ambient noise.My biggest complaint is the RIOPort software.  There is NO SIMPLE WAY to download songs directly to the device from a folder or CD ROM.  Instead, you have to import the songs into a database and then create playlists.  If you move songs from one subdirectory to another, you have to manually edit database entries for every song that you moved--a tedious and time-consuming process.  If you re-add the songs to the database after the move, you get duplicate entries, only one of which is valid.  However, you can't tell which entry is the valid one.Another gripe--after paying this much money for an audio player, it seems wrong to have to shell out another $9.95 to unlock the software.In short--great product once you get the songs loaded, but reaching that point is frustrating at times.",4
"The Rio500 is a great MP3 player - in this reviewer's opinion, the best on the market currently.  Its size (smaller than a pack of cigarettes) and weight (about an oz.) recommend it to shirt-pocket musicophiles and,  especially, athletes! (You can jog all day with nary a skip, and with the  included netting belt-clip, it will definitely NOT pull your jogging shorts  down, weighing about the same as a pager.)Interface with any USB  Macintosh is seamless, and the included software, Casady &amp; Greene's  SoundJam MP, is the finest Mac application in decades.  All you need to  know is how to work the plug, and how to drag and drop, and you'll be  organizing your Rio playlists with no trouble.  If it isn't already,  SoundJam will become your MP3 player of choice, too.The Rio takes  SmartMedia cards and can reportedly handle any size, including the upcoming  100+ MB cards; mine works perfectly with a 32 MB Sandisk SmartMedia card.  (96 MB is just about perfect for listening to a full 72-minute CD  recording, say of Beethoven's Fifth, at 160 kbps sound quality.)I also  get great sound out of a phones-to-cassette adapter, which I use to  playback MP3's in my car.  My only complaint is that the included ear-beads  are terrible, both acoustically and for the fact that they just won't stay  in!  Alternative headphones can be used, but drain the power source (1 AA  battery) rather quickly.  A solution might be NiMH high capacity  rechargables.",5
"I think that this is one of the most used toys I own.  Great for taking in  my car to have a fresh sound every week. Great for taking for a jog or  working out in the gym (no skipping).  I only wish they included a ac  adapter plug. Plays music smooth and loud, great mp3 player!",5
"Very well made unit.  Great sound.  Connects via USB cable to PC. Battery life is so-so.  Good support from manufacturer.  You can get firmware updates easily at their website.  Comes with a &quot;card&quot;, not a manual.  But there is a good manual, and a printable version, at the RIO website.  Provided headphones stink.  You can get a NICE leather case from the Sonicblue website store.  64mb stores a lot of music.  I added 64mb card, which are coming down nicely in price.  I have two RIO500's, one for music, and one for my audio books.  Decent headphone volume. Display with latest firmware is sometimes hard to read.  If you pull the USB plug during download, or if download is interrupted, the RIO will lock up, good.  BUT, Sonicblue tech support website does have program you can download for free that will fix it (usually).  This happened to me, and the program worked fine!Right now, I think it is good buy.  The other RIO MP3 players use expensive memory &quot;backpacks&quot;, or rechargable batteries (RIO800).  I prefer alkalines.  Regular rechargable AA batteries are not recommended for the 500.I think it's a great unit.  5 stars easily!!",5
"I just recently received the Rio 500 for a Father's Day gift. I wanted one to paly audible files so I was pleasently suprised to receive it. Unfortunately I'm returning it because the device doesn't live up to it's billing.The main problems: 1) Low volume. Even max'd out the unit  doesn't have enough volume to drown out any background noise when listening  to the unit in a loud environment. ie. coffee house2) Poor documentation  and software. There's little documentation with the unit to describe the  functions of the scroll wheel etc. you're on your own to figure it  out.3) Headphones- the very first day I lost one of the foam caps and  had to have it replaced, only to have it fall off again a number of  times.I called Tech support about the volume problems and they just  responded that the Rio 600 has better volume. It was obvious that they were  unable to talk honestly about the 500 since it is a product that is being  phased out.Having said all of this I did purchase the Rio 600 and I give  it two thumbs up. The volume rocks and it has more functionality to the  controls and the layout. Since the 600 cost over $100. and has only 32MB of  internal memory it's more expensive but in the long run I think you'll be  happier.",2
"I have a 300 and now a 500. There are a few reasons this unit is a big improvement. Most impt is the USB connection, which makes uploading much faster and is conflict free. The software upgrades easily and the added memory capacity is thus doubled. If you download your songs at very high compression, sound remains good and capacity can exceed 3 hours. One suggestion: get real headphones!",4
"This is great for jogging and sports, but for most, an hour of music isn't  enough. If I added an hour more as in memory, it would cost me $150/64megs!  I spend at least 4 hours(10 hours max)listening to music... while I could  saved it for the new Mp3 players(capacity in the Gigs!) arriving later this  year, well that's what they said.People who will be using it for a  short while every day should buy it, but downloading Mp3s with a 56k modem  is a huge problem.It's easy to use from buying it to using it. The size  made me realize to get it, but I'm still using Cd players for the rest of  the day. It did what I expected(only jogging), but I rather have those with  Gigs as in memory instead of only megs.It's useless during vacations!  AAARRRGGGHHH!",4
"I bought an S-VHS unit simply to get the s-video in/out plugs.  Now I can have just one wire (s-video) going to my TV.  The JVC VCR has a nice feature in that when you change channels up/down, included in the list is  Line-1 (where I input from my dish).  So, after the highest TV channel it  just goes to the dish input -- nice!  I don't need the TV remote except to  turn the thing on.  Also, any time I want to play a tape, I just put in a  tape and run it and it just takes over the TV picture.  The instructions  were not clear on the 'plug/play' hookup.  It didn't seem to be working but  I left it alone for a while and it was OK.  It just needed to find the time  signal from my local PBS station which is only sent once per hour -- I hope  that's helpful. I haven't tried it with an S-VHS tape.  A complaint I have  is that when useing S-VHS ET with a regular VHS tape, there is no indicator  that shows the quality that it allowed itself to record at.  One could  argue that one could just observe the tape, post recording.  However, I'd  like to try a tape to see if that important movie will record on *that*  tape in a high quality.",4
"I have used this model for 8 months and it has plenty of audio and video (including SVideo) inputs.  It can record and play S-VHS and VHS tapes,  with the former providing superior playback using the 2-hours recording  mode and an S-VHS tape.  It auto detects the tape type and has an easy to  use remote.  The best S-VHS machine in this price range.",5
"I'm pleased with the VCR, but it took about an hour to get it set up properly.  Plug &amp; play didn't work.  I finally ended up setting the channels and clock manually, and the initial configuration is relatively  complicated.  I am a little bit disappointed with the remote.  One reason  that I selected a JVC VCR is because I hoped it would interoperate well  with my other JVC components, but the remote is awkward to use with my TV  and DBS.  Overall though, it has a lot of nice features for the money, and  the picture quality is good.",3
I got this JVC video tape player a long time ago and guess I paid about $100 for it back then. It's the only VCR we have now that still works and don't eat up VHS tapes. I got it because of the S/Video and I can play are old VHS tapes with S/Video to a DVD recorder S/Video input to save are old VHS tapes to DVD. With the way are other VCR's are not working and messing up VHS tapes it is very good to get them saved to DVD and this is about the best way using S/Video.-Raymond Day,5
"I have no complaints. I love the picture quality. The picture quality is even further raised with features like VIDEO STABLIZER, VIDEO CALIBRATION, and you can change the sharp tone to ""SHARP"" for a sharp picture, ""SOFT"" for a smooth picture, and ""AUTO"" for use with VIDEO CALIBRATION. This VCR is the most reliable I have ever seen. Sometimes the picture quality is better that DVD recorders. Unlike DVD recorders, there are certain tapes that can record HDTV. Use that tape with its Super Video connection, and you will have a knock-out.When you hook up your antenna to the VCR, then from the VCR, to the T.V., you get a super clear picture. (For antenna users) It also has VCR plus, so you can connect it to your cable box and it will automatically record for you, A S-Video connection, HI-FI, and an MTS decoder.",5
"Pros: Excellent value, great picture quality in S-VHS, jog/shuttle, S-Video in/outs, Easy setup, cables included, quality construction, lots of features, OK tracking, Super VHS ET mode, 400+ lines of resolution, Has 19u Heads For Taping In The Extended Mode, Can Record Super VHS On Standard Tapes, do I need to say more?!?!Cons: Tracking problems in EP mode, flimsy, some color problems, Super VHS tapes may be hard to find and expensive, the menu system is kind of complicated, Clunky remote, traditional programming procedure, Front Display PanelThe Bottom LineThe HR3600U is a bargain &#65533; the picture quality, S-VHS ability and features for $ are excellent.Highly Reccommended!!IntroductionMy reason for purchasing this VCR was simple. I wanted an inexpensive VCR with S-Video inputs. For those who may not know, S-Video inputs allow the transfer of 400 lines of resolution, as opposed to the usual 260 or so transmitted via RCA connections. In theory, the higher the resolution is the better the picture looks.FunctionalityIn addition to the VCR, there are a set of RCA cables and an S-Video cable included as well. Overall the unit is a piece of cake to setup. The unit has both RCA and S-Video jacks on the back, and a set of RCA jacks on the front. This makes it easy to hook up an external source (such as a camcorder or something) and record to VHS. I have my unit hooked up to my computer (it has a video card with S-Video out and RCA audio outs), and I haven&#65533;t actually used the input jacks on the front of the VCR. Another feature I really like is the simple 1-touch recording button on the unit. The way I have it set up, I can just reach up from my computer and hit it, and off it goes.This unit has a jog/shuttle wheel which is used to perform all the rewinds and fast forwards. I&#65533;ll have to say, this is my first experience with a shuttle wheel. I like it! It just seems more cool than a &#65533;rewind&#65533; or &#65533;fast forward&#65533; button. Lol The unit rewinds tapes faster than my old Zenith VCR.The clock is easy to set as well. I think this is an area which has been greatly improved upon in recent years. For that matter, all the menu items are laid out in a common sense manner, which makes programming and such even easier.I noticed some were saying they didn&#65533;t like the remote control, but I think it is just fine. Grant it, I don&#65533;t use it much, but the times I have used it, I haven&#65533;t encountered any problems with it.Two other things I really like are (1) Having a time code counter display on the LCD so you know how much you&#65533;ve recorded. (2) When you rewind, this little bar pops up on screen and shows you where you are relative to the length of the tape. It&#65533;s not really super useful, but I just like knowing where I&#65533;m at.Picture QualityI&#65533;ll have to say that for $, this unit produces great quality dubs in regular VHS mode. I&#65533;ve been using it for several months now, and the video productions I&#65533;ve produced always come out looking very good. And that&#65533;s the most important thing! I haven&#65533;t dubbed anything in S-VHS or S-VHS ET mode yet because none of my projects have warranted that. I would imagine that the picture quality would be even more outstanding than the regular VHS mode though.Nit PicksWhile the outer enclosure looks nice, the unit &#65533;feels- cheap. I don&#65533;t think it would hold up too well under any kind of rough conditions. Hopefully this VCR will reside either in your home theater or a setup like mine where it stays put and isn&#65533;t moved around too much.The cheesy &#65533;glow in the dark&#65533; keys on the keypad of the remote. I hate it when electronics manufacturer&#65533;s use these gimmicky things. They never work.ConclusionsFor the money, you just can&#65533;t beat this VCR. The ease of setup and great picture quality are this VCR&#65533;s strongest points. I highly recommend this VCR to anyone looking for a budget level VCR.",4
"Esta camara la he comprado por que puedo grabar todas las fotos en discos flexibles, solo es cargar en el carro una caja de discos y tienes para cientos de fotos, una buena idea de la marca. Me ha gustado mucho y la he disfrutado mucho.",5
"This camera definitely works for what I need it for - taking pictures to use on my Web site, The Schumin Web, and saving the remainder as stock photos.  The floppy disk storage allows for you to take literally thousands of pictures without going back to your computer, and thus gets high marks for portability.  All in all, a great camera, and if you're like me, whenever you take it with you, carry some floppies in your pocket, because you will be taking a lot of pictures.",5
"The Sony Mavica was my first color digital camera.  Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more.2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesn't make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.P.S. I traded up to a Kodak DC260 and like it fine.",3
"The Mavica MVC-73 is a good low end camera.  If I want to blow up my pictures to 16X20, I use my 35mm SLR.  Megapixel cameras do take better pictures but they require EXPENSIVE memory cards.  The camera takes great shots for web sites and email.  If you shop around, floppies cost almost nothing.  With a rebate, I bought 100 floppies.  I put 10 of them in a bag and I took over 200 photos. (It would have cost me hundreds of dollars to save that many pictures on memory cards.) They used up less room than two rolls of film.  The recharable battery lasts forever and I can go out and take hundreds of photos without having to dump the memory card.  Achiving the photos uses little disk space on my hard drive.  The camera is very easy to use and in the long run pays for itself on the savings on film development, batteries or extra memory.  I give copies of disks right on the spot and the camera is very reliable. If you are looking for a good &quot;snapshot&quot; camera, this is a good one.  The other reviews mention the good and bad points of the camera so there is no need to mention them again.  This is a great camera for real estate or onsite documentation and great for the 100000000 pictures of the baby or the family picnic.  It's a fun, simple and easy to use camera. How many pictures do you wind up enlarging?  I run my favorites on my screensaver and they look great.",4
"This is my introduction to the digital camera.  So far, I'm very pleased with the results.  The Mavica is programmed with five picture formats: Fine, Sepia, B&amp;W, Negative Art, and Solarize.  It is easy to use, even for the beginner.  I disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size.  I was able to shove it in my purse when I wasn't using it; however, for the price, I would've liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case.  It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well. I like this camera, but if I win the lottery someday, I will go out and buy a CD camera because of the memory constraints that these floppy-based cameras have.",4
"A wonderful camera for Intrnet use. For auctions, emails, web sites, Etc. this is a fine camera. The advantages are great macros (down to 1&quot;),10X zoom lens, comes with rechagable battery and charger, simple downloading of floppies to your PC and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium.  However this is NOT a camera suitable for Photos (Because of the 640X480 resolution) Do not make the mistake of taking important shots and assume you can get decent photos. For fine photos go to a 1 or 2 megapixel cameras. I also own the Nikon Coolpix 950 camera and recommend any Nikon or Olympus camera. Only the Nikons have great Macro capability (If this is important) A great buy for the money is the Olympus 460/490.",4
"The convenience of floppy disks is hard to beat. No proprietary cables or special setup is required. Even the newer cameras with the USB interface often require their own goofy PhotoSchmuck software to be installed.The  floppy drive enables us to share our pics at any time, even with friends  that have older computers or (God forbid) a Mac. Almost any computer can  read the format-standard JPEG used by the Mavica cameras. You can even dupe  a disk in the middle of nowhere. Try that with a smart card! If you want to  make a living with artful photography look higher up the line, or at the  Olympus 600. If you want to make a living on eBay, or just have fun with  your camera, it's hard to beat the Mavica for convenience and versatility.",4
"I have used this camera since the late 1990s for mostly professional purposes. I write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs and/or to accompany job announcements, often with almost no prior notice.Of all the cameras I looked at in the 1990s, this was the one that best suited my needs. The reasons for that follow:1. Shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my PC.2. The 10X zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when I could not get close to my subject.3. The camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder, a large left hand grip, and big button to press when shooting pictures.Before I bought this camera, I worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work I do now. In all those years I never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one, nor did I use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to e-file was easier.Having said that, this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results. It is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in events.But I've taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes, and I took some pictures of the Christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a tree.So don't buy this to create award-winning photography. For all the same reasons, it doesn't produce very good hardcopy photos.But this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast. That's my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it.In addition, the battery charger works fast and I've never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a half-decade of use. I don't know how this stacks up in the camera industry but it's a lot better than most of the electronic equipment I use in the office or at home.",4
"Simple, and easy to use for what it does, this is starting to look a bit overpriced nowadays. On the good side, you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures, the batteries last for ages and it's extremely easy to  use, but on the other hand the resolution (640x480 in hi-res) isn't good  enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps. If you're prepared to  do lots of re-touching you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool,  and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself, but for anything  more than simple web-site images and casual snaps you'd be better off with  a proper megapixel camera with some kind of smart-card memory storage.",4
"This camera takes okay pictures and it's very easy to use. Don't be repulsed by other reviewers who doesn't know how to use the camera, just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself. It is in some ways  over-priced due to the zoom and floppy drive; a 10x zoom (optical) with a  640x480 is better than a 6x zoom(2x optical and 3x digital) with 1280x960.  I don't like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media, because there are  different essentiel accessories that aren't included in those prices(the  compact flash cards could make you say &quot;Aaaarrrrrggghhhh! I don't have  enough because I spent every penny on the camera!&quot;).At the end,  this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures, but it  comes cheaper than other cameras. If you have a lot of money to invest,  don't buy this one, just buy the best camera with the best lens and don't  look at lower priced items, because quality is what you want.Last thing  to say to whom never touched a digital camera, you must know how the camera  works and how and when it take good or even excellent  pictures.Congratulations to those who bought mavicas(me!)!",5
"Not being a computer or camera &quot;pro&quot; I needed something easy to use. I looked at the reviews for the product here at Amazon. I decided to buy the F83 model. This model allows for a 15 second &quot;movie&quot;. Boy  do I like it. I like the ease of the Floppy disk. The quality is fine for  my needs. The battery lasts a long time. A camera bag is a necessity since  the LCD screen marks easily. I recommend the camera to anyone wanting a  digital camera that is easy to use. Thanks Amazon for providing the  reviews, and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews. I  found them very helpful.",5
"For entry level digital photography, you could do far worse than the Mavica.  What sold me initially, aside from the very reasonable price, was that it used floppy discs instead of internal storage.  What this means is that if you have a pocket full of discs you can take pictures all day without ever having to download to your PC.  It also means you don't have to worry about a free parallel, serial or USB port, which, if you're a peripheral junkie like me, is reason enough to give serious consideration to this camera.On the downside - yes, there is one - the resolution is not what you might hope for.  When used at normal size, the pics are fine, not great.  They're useable.  When you try to increase the size to 5x7 or 8x10, the results are disastrous.  The other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture, but the camera does not function well indoors with available light.  You really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right.  Sometimes it's just not possible.So, do I recommend this camera?  Yes, with reservations.  If you're looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare, then look elsewhere.  But if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price, particularly for outdoor use, check out the Mavica.",3
"This is great camera with many features. You can take the pictures in many conditions. The flashlight is good enough for Indoor shooting. You can use the A-REC mode for automatic shooting &amp; M-REC mode for manual Shooting. You will have a great photos just using A-REC mode. Just switch on the bottom &amp; ready to take photos. If you want more professional photos use M-REC mode. You can adjust for the manual shutter speed or manual aperture. In this feature you customize your photos even you can bright your object at the poor light. The 2.11 mega pixels is good enough for viewing in the web, sending though E-mail &amp; print in A4 paper. The worst think that I know is a battery live. This camera it's so hungry with power, that I thought same with the others digicam. For your convenient use a 3 set of NIMH batteries, which can take 30 to 40 pictures each set in normal used. You can save your battery live with minimize using LCD monitor to framing the object.",4
"I use this camera with a usb sans disk flashcard reader, which I find incredibly convenient. I email pictures to family regularly.  The quality is matchless, but I have to ramp down the resolution and size or some files  can be over 1 meg.The quality is so exquisite, that (get this) got a  color matched fabric from a friend in NY based on a close up picture I took  of a printed upholstery piece.  I took a closeup of a diseased mahonia  leaf, emailed it to my mom, and she diagnosed thrips and suggested  BT.This is a camera with more capability than I need, but the picture  quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the  online manual and learn.  I print pics on a HP722 and the prints look  great. (Tho the color degrades after a year. Printer ink problem, not  Camera)However, it has a few shortcomings. The paperless manual is a  pain when you are learning.  You just CANNOT see the lcd screen on the  camera in bright light which makes using the manual settings impossible.  The add on lenses (wide angle, etc) are awkward to use. I have lost more of  the tiny lens caps than I will confess.  I even dropped one on the grass  and was unable to find it right after dropping it.  I now have 6, having  asked everyone I know for one for presents.",4
"I bought a Nikon Coolpix (my first digital camera) about a six months ago and am very satisfied with it.  Previously, I had owned a Nikon 35 MM &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; camera, but was interested in the advantages a  digital camera would provide;  immediate gratification through seeing your  pictures NOW, the ability to send JPG images to freinds and relatives, the  ability to delete pictures &quot;on-the-fly&quot;, etc.  What I got was a  mixed bag of results - mostly positive.Before I go any further, I must  advise you to get the following options:  two sets of rechargable NiMH  batteries which should be standard with the camera (I use the Kodak ones  available at Amazon.com), a higher-capacity memory card (I use a 128 MB San  Disk - Nikon's OEM), and some sort of adapter to transfer your images  quickly - the serial cable is just too slow.  I have purchased a SanDisk  adapter and insert the memory card directly into the PCMCIA slot on my  laptop computer for rapid transfer.Anyways, in use the camera is  fantastic.  Initially, I was using the 640X480 resolution setting to save  space, but with the new, larger card, I now use the 1600X1200 setting with  moderate compression for all pictures.  I find that the card can hold about  100 pictures at this resolution.  Once I find a picture I like, I use the  Microsoft Photo Editor software (comes with Office) and reduce the  resolution as appropriate (web pages, etc.).  I store my  &quot;keepers&quot; on CDROM at the higher resolution - you can always  reduce resolution and size.The picture quality is great.  The flash,  however, should only be used up to 10' - any further and your pictures come  out too dark.  Nikon USA has a web page with the latest firmware available  for download - which I recommend.Low points for the camera include the  fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off!  I find myself zooming out every time I turn the camera on - this eats up  your batteries and takes time.  The flap that covers the memory card does  not always stay closed and flops open from time to time.  Sometimes, the  camera takes a while to reset between pictures, so a bit of spontaneity is  lost.There are now newer cameras out there.  I find that the 2.1  Megapixel capability of this camera meets my needs and that, given the  recent price reductions, I would buy this Nikon now if I were in the market  today.",4
"Overall, this isn't a bad digital camera for most types of photography.  It's quite easy to use, and perfect for the beginner.  The only real gripes I have are the limitations in the size of the Compact Flash it uses, and the fact that after a time, the battery compartment won't stay closed.  Otherwise, I've taken some fantastic pictures with this camera!  In fact, I'd have to say it does better than some of the newer Nikon Coolpix cameras (like the L18, which I also have).  I've found newer models to have focus and flash issues, as well as severe shutter lag.  This may not be comparable in resolution, but it's quite enough for most uses.  You don't need more than 2.1 MegaPixel for decent resolution unless you're doing huge blow-ups of photographs.",4
"I also own a Sony Mavica and a Kodak DC260 so this isn't my first digital camera. With the 950 I found that I needed to read the manual with care  because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to  just &quot;go for it.&quot; After blowing through several dozen test pics,  I started to find the tricks to metering, autofocus and Nikon's digital  simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera.  The quality of the pictures, once you get the hang of using the camera in a  particular setting, is amazing. This is the highest digital quality I've  experienced with a digital camera.",4
"I love my Nikon. It was a gift from a friend who is a professional photographer. She had outgrown it and was tired of me complaining that I saw this or that and wished at the time I had a better camera than my phone.If you have never used one of these before it will take a little getting used to. The camera pivots in half (which is quite disconcerting and a bit confusing) so you can change the angle of the viewing screen to the lens. The whole thing rotates freely 360 degrees, with snap-lock settings at each 180, so you can watch yourself ""taking a picture of you"" or use the viewing screen versus the manual viewfinder. The flash is a bit annoying, as it automatically fires in even remotely low-light circumstances. A simple press of a button disables the flash, but then you have a longer exposure time (about one full second) which means that you have to keep your hands really, really still. Just for fun, try taking a picture of the full moon and see how much you hand shakes.This camera is really at its best during the day. It should win an award for being the official picnic (or even beach) camera. It really is point and shoot, but it has an easy to learn and use zoom, auto/manual flash, and you can turn off the viewfinder with the push of a button if you are running low on battery. The live motion feed on the viewing screen is a bit jittery, but for the price that is nothing to sneeze at. My guesstimate is something like 3-5 frames-per-second of video capture on the view screen while you are searching for that perfect moment to snap the picture.The short version: It is self-contained, easy to load and swap the memory card. It takes high resolution photos, and is so easy to use (and durable) that a 5 year-old could handle it (carefully). Stock up on extra AA batteries though. It eats through 4 of them in a few days of use.Hope this helps",4
"Amazon's review still touts this as a &quot;top of the line&quot; camera when Nikon released the third generation CoolPix 990 months ago. The 990  fixes all the complaints people had with the 900 and the 950 (shown here).  It also ups the resolution to 2K x1500 (3.34 Megapixels). It's a fantastic  camera.That much said the 990 is more expensive, and if you don't need  the extra resolution the 950 remains a great choice at a lower price. I  just take exception to Amazon presenting it as &quot;top of the  line.&quot;The swiveling body on the 900, 950, and 990 allows you to  hold the camera over your head with the lens looking down, or at your knees  with the lens looking up, and still be able to see your composition on the  LCD display, because the LCD is on the other half of the body from the  lens. You just twist to see the LCD regardless of where the lens is  pointing. Other digital cameras don't do this and it's really useful. It's  made possible by the fact that these cameras (especially the 990) are so  good at autofocus, autoexposure, and autowhite balance that for very many  scenes you can use the LCD to compose and frame the shot, not worry about  anything else, and get a great result.",4
"Having been a professional photographer for over 25 years I expected Nikon to produce superior results.  Forget that the camera is difficult to use, the final quality of the pictures is poor.  If you shoot only in sunlight  or shadow it's OK, but mix them and the result is unacceptable.  No  latitude, or gamma, and even Photoshop fails to correct the problems.  Maybe in the future, but until then, buy something to play with but use  real film.  I returned mine...",1
"I paid $15.77 for this camera and it's great! The one I got looked like it was hardly used at all! It was out of the box but came with all accessories, the memory card, the case to protect it, lens cap, all user manuals...I got this camera to try to learn how to do Infrared photography. I have to say, it's an amazing camera! I wish I had this camera when it was released in 1999! I pretty much turned the camera on, and it worked amazingly! I used the adapter I bought on amazon to fix a 52m filter on and I have actually obtained amazing pictures! I am really enjoying infrared photography so far, and I am moving onto ultraviolet photography next. I am doing this all for fun and my own enjoyment. I didn't want to mod my Nikon d3100...so this is the next best thing. For about 30 bucks I have this camera, the adapter, and the infrared filter. I have to say if you are looking to do some interesting things with your photography and are not willing to mod your high end camera, this is a great 2nd option. Affordable also... =)",5
"I have owned this camera for over 9 months now and I really like it. The image quality is stunning and I didn't find it all that hard to figure out how to use it. The controls are generally well thought out and positioned  ergonomically.The camera is also slow (I think this is true with most  digital cameras.) You click the shutter and about 1 or 2 secs later it  takes the picture. This may not sound like a big deal, but last night I was  trying to take pictures of my infant son, and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the camera.A significant short coming is  the built in flash. Its nowhere near powerful enough, even for a simple  head and shoulders shot when the subject is 4 feet away. Images often come  out too dark. This wouldn't be so bad if there were accomodations for an  external flash, but there doesn't seem to be one. Also, the camera tends to  create &quot;red eye&quot; a lot, which you can correct if you have  PhotoShop, but that's more work than I want to do.The camera does eat up  a lot of power, I agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable  batteries. You can get a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for about $20  bucks (it takes 4 AA batteries.) I'd suggest getting at least 8 AA  batteries.I do suggest getting extra memory (I have 32 megs) and one of  those USB memory card readers, its a lot faster than a serial port.",4
"Great camera once you learn the menus and buttons. Advanced users of electronic cameras will find this easy. I have avoided the auto-everything camera's because I like controlling all of the creative process. Because of  this, it took me a while to get used to the menus and buttons, but it was  not hard. The Coolpix 950 still allows you to control the creative process  but I would recommend a good book on digital photography (such as Real  World Digital Photography) to get you started, especially if you're a film  junkie such as myself. Note: a memory card reader for your computer and  bigger CompactFlash cards will make the camera much more enjoyable as well  as rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. The first two replace your film and  processing budget. One nice thing is that you can instantly reuse the  memory card. Mistakes can be erased immediately and the same memory space  used for a better shot. A light steady tripod is also recommended as the  camera has a &quot;speed rating&quot; of ISO 80 and shutter speeds tend to  be slow without flash. If you must use flash, get an external unit as the  on board flash is too close to the lens and, as with all small cameras,  produces flat featureless images. You'll also need access to a good, fast  color printer to print out the full reference manual. A copy center such as  Kinko's should work. This is not a camera for the &quot;instamatic&quot;  crowd. Hint: negative reviewers tend to be disappointed because it is not  an out-of-the-box instant hit, but with a little creative work, the camera  does well. I may trade up to the CoolPix 990 in a year or two after the  price comes down.",4
"This camera takes excellent quality digital pictures and comes with the Nikonview software which enables you to make basic edits on the pictures on your computer.  It is fairly easy to use and the compact flash uploads into the computer either via a reader or directly from the camera.  I have seen some digital pictures which made me wonder why you would bother, the quality was so poor.  This camera is the best I have seen and I would highly recommend it.",5
I just got the camera two days ago and have been tinkering with it ever since.  The macro mode alone makes this camera a worthy investment.  I do agree with others that the manual controls are a little tricky but I figure  if you manage to get a good picture then you earned it.  I have not been  disappointed yet by the quality.  Picked up 8 rechargeable batteries and a  64 mb card and I haven't looked back since.,5
"I just received this camera about a week ago. Since then I'vereplaced the 8mb memory card with a 96mb card. This camera definitelytakes some getting used to. I'm taking mostly photo's of my new twinsand find that I'm either afflicted with the palsy or the camera is super sensitive to shaking. Suggest trying a tripod (that is my next investment).I think you also need to experiment with things like shutter speed to get the maximum picture out of the camera. I have had very mixed results with closeups but blame myself for not having gotten the hang of this yet.Overall it is a really nice unit, solidly built. You'll need a bigger memory card, probably a USB card reader and NIMH batterys (don't let them sell you NICADS - get the 1500mah NIMH along with a 1 hour rapid charger).You won't be sorry with the camera!",5
Works just fine,4
"..this is good labeling tape.I've been using theBrother PT-70 labelerfor a while, and use the black-on-white labels as visual aids on electrical/data cabling connection points and to categorize the contents inside plastic storage containers.You don't really have a choice about the tape you use in any label maker; but this loads easily and stands up to the demands that come from occasional applications in demanding environments.Select with confidence for your PT-70/PT-90 labeler.",5
I bought this to help label the kids school supplies.  It works great with my p-touch.  I will continue to purchase in the future.,5
love this and the price of it was good as well.  would definitely buy this for my labeler again. awesome,5
I use this item at work and its a good product that serves it purpose. i would recommend this item,4
"The labeler that this fits is easy to use, has a nice selection of style of label, and the print is terrific.  There is a good amount of tape in each dispenser, I think it's a must have for anyone that has quite a few things to label.  The labels stick and stay well.",5
"These were great! Easy to use, easy to replace, would definitely buy again!These were shipped very quickly and arrived right on time.",5
Great OEM cartidge for the P Touch.  Makes me file cabinet look professional and the cost is very reasonable.  Highly recommend this!,5
"It works perfectly. What can I say other than that? The inexpensive Brother PT-80 Personal Labeler (Navy Blue/Green) that this goes with is awesome, so I pay the price for the refills gladly.",5
"Perfect for your P-Touch label maker. High quality labels with a decent mount of ribbon length for the price. The only hard thing is getting the sticker off of the ribbon paper, would recommend the easy break off ones down the middle if you are willing to pay extra. Overall though a great product for the price.",5
"I expected this to work seemlesly and it did, so I do not have any complains. Amazon had a great price compared to the local staples., worked well for me.",3
"I have used this product for twelve years, I still get impressed how long this tape lasts, and the ink never smudges.",5
I have 2 P Touch label machines and find the machines and the labels work great. I use them at work and for home use.,5
"This label cartridge is great. It prints white labels with black ink. I was out of stock and couldn't find them at CVS, Walgreens, or even Officemax. So I bought a few of them in bulk at Amazon.",5
This replacement labeling tape is for a low end Brother labeler. Amazon had best price and shipped quickly.,4
used to label was a gift. As far as I know there are no complaints to the item shown above.,3
"We bought one of these labelers.  The first surprise came as we started to use it.  As has been noted at length by another reviewer on this page, these labelers are designed to waste the tape.  OK, we thought.  Whatever.Then, when the tape ran out, we purchased more via Amazon.  Wow, these refills are unreasonably expensive!  Brother clearly has a ""give away the razors and sell the blades"" philosophy, seemingly making all of their money on the tape.  But we bought it anyway, cause what else were we going to do?  We were stuck.We got the tape, inserted it correctly.  But the cartridge was faulty and it unraveled on the second label.  Irreperable.  So we called Brother and -- guess what -- the tapes have NO WARRANTY!!So, unless you are in the mood to give Brother a *blank check* for your labeling needs, don't get into bed with them.  They will leave you angry and wanting.",1
This tape works fine for my label printer. The adhesive holds pretty well. It is not very flexible once you have it stuck on - I would not advise using it for labeling cables unless you use the &#34;flag&#34; method. I have noticed that if you leave the labels on something for an extended period of time it leaves a white residue behind if/when you remove them.,4
"Label tape works as advertised on Brother PT-90.  Just take the cover off of the back and insert cartridge.  It works wonderfully but I think that it's pretty sad that I paid more for the tape than I did for the whole labeler.  Regardless, I'm still very happy with the product.",4
Works - prompt delivery - not issues - OEM brother cart - works just fine in my label maker - not sure with whats up with Amazon's posting filters - their trying to tell me my original review couldn't be posted ? - its a great product ! - like what gives ?,5
What can I say it's the perfect refill and gets the job done!  This comes highly recommended for your brother P-touch labeler,5
I have an old model P-Touch but it works excellent. I've had it for many years and have never had a problem with it. Glad to still be able to find tape cartridges.,5
i have a PT-65 and works great - the tape i received is a genuine Brother product.products like these keep you on top of your GTD implementation!,5
Works great.  Make sure you have the correct size - there are at least 2 different size tapes (M & TZ) and they are not interchangeable.,5
love this and the silver refills  i see alot of reorders in the future!!!,5
Brother has hit a home run with their labeling tape systems.I used to spin the old Dynamo labeler to make labels but nomore.,4
"I just purchased a few of these and it was disappointing that it was half the price of what I paid for the whole unit with a couple of these. Overall, it works as described so I only docked it 1 star for the price.",4
"I've had my P-Touch labeler for years now, and I feel like I'm always labeling something: files, leftovers, kids' stuff.  But I only just now needed a new cartridge.  So don't hold back; label EVERYTHING!  These labels are high quality.  They stick until (unless) you remove them, then they come up without leaving any residue.  You can even restick them!  And because they are thermally activated, the ""ink"" won't smear if it gets wet.  I couldn't be more satisfied (except the backing is so hard to get off...).",5
Official brother M-tape does the job right in the label maker.  Cheaper than all the local office stores.  Organization is priceless.,4
These cartriges are well build and the tape dispenses smoothly they are a littl;e prices but it does a good job.,4
"Have a P-Touch Labeler? Have you run out of printing tape? Well, here you go -- just order this and you'll be all set to label until you run out of things to label!",3
"The product came in the factory sealed packaging. I have owned the Brother P-touch PT-65 for many years now and I love it. I am so much more organized. But this is about the tape. I use this tape on everything - file folders, plastic containers, metal, cardboard, everything except I don't think I've ever put it on wood. The most difficult thing is peeling the label from the backing. Some days it's easy, some days not so much. The key is to gently rub the pad of your thumb over the edge of a corner of the tape. Usually this separates the tape from the backing enough to peel it off. The tape sticks very well - I've even washed over the labels several times before it started to peel up on the corners - but it also peels off easily except from paper. It always seems a little expensive to me but one cartridge lasts forever.",5
"Not much to say about label tape other than it works great for my labeler. Label tape is way overpriced, just like ink, so I recommend trying to waste as little as possible.",3
"I use these labels and the associated base-model Brother label machine to tag plastic shoe boxes used to sort electronic and mechanical components.  They stick perfectly and stay for a long time (several years now and counting) without peeling up at the corners.  The print is high contrast and retains its color.  All told, a great quality label.",5
fits in the machine perfectly - just drop it in the space and it automatically starts right up and you can continue whatever it was that you were working on - no muss no fuss,5
This is the refill for my Touch Labeler and while it may be slightly tricky to replace; you really have to line it up properly; it is ideal and functions just as expected for a refill.,5
This is the origional just like what came with the machine and it works the same too.  You'll like it.,5
This is just what you'd expect - a perfect fit replacement for a label maker.  Text comes out sharp and it doesn't jam.,5
M tape for Brother P-Touch.  Not much to say other than it loaded right into our P-touch Home & Hobby model PT-65 labeler.  Prints fine.,5
"It just works, it's really trouble-proof. I have no concerns about it and i would recommend it to a friend.",5
Brother makes good labelers that works and sticks.  This is a convenient model and is useful in everyday labeling.  Not too expensive and stays on the items you apply.,4
This tape is easy to install and easy to use. It comes off whatever you are adhering it to very nicely and without leaving a residue. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to organize their life.,5
Bought this to use for labeling binders and to label how much money remains on gift cards.The ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long. It partially prints each letter/number like some of the ribbon has gotten old and won't stick to the label. I would not recommend this product.,2
"This spool of replacement tape shipped quickly, fit our Brother P-Touch perfectly and was priced at less than half of what the office store was selling for.  The ink prints black on a white tape face.  These economical replacements allow for labeling with reckless abandon.",5
I went to Staples at first and found their price to be very high.  Since it is &#34;retail packaged&#34; the produce is the same everywhere so I saved buying here,4
"** IMPORTANT NOTE: This product also fits theBrother PT-65 Labeler!!! (The description only lists the newer model label-makers.)I love my label-maker and can't imagine life without it. I label Rubbermaid totes, charging cables, A/V equipment, boxes, leftovers for the freezer, etc...and it always sticks to everything...and actually comes off cleanly as well. Just make sure whatever you're labeling is dust/dirt free and you'll be good to go.",4
"I have used this Brother M231 tape before, and it works fine. It is easy to load and work with.",5
I love my brother p-touch and this is the normal refill for it. It works just as well as the last one and even holds up in the fridge and the freezer.,5
I have bought this before. I get at least 4 years of label printing. I print things for my son at school and lots more.,5
"It fits and works well, it's the original Brother m tape 1/2&#34;. No problems, works just fine, you'll like it.",5
I've used these labels to do my filing. It's a lot neater and easier to read my files. It's the way to go.,5
"The low rating is because the product description was not thorough enough for this old man.I blame Brother & myself (hindsight, I should have investigated the product more) The descriptionsaid &#34;Brother M231 1/2-Inch Black on White Tape for P-Touch Labeler &#34;  I have a &#34;P-Touch&#34; labeler &mistakenly thought the cartridges were for my P-Touch, not knowing there must be other models of P-Touch.I am a retired manufacturer & my old school thinking was to change model designation  when models were notcompatible.",2
I like having two labelers - the larger Brother P-touch which takes TZ tape cartridges and the smaller brother P-touch which takes M tapes. I've found the lowest price for both tapes is on amazon.com. I keep a red on white tape in one and a black on white tape in the other.,5
"We have an old Brother P Touch that has been working for years. The only difference between these and the ones you buy at a local retailer, is the price ... much lower at Amazon. We always make purchases that give us the free shipping, to add to the savings.",5
"arrived in a timely manner, i believe it is oem, works as advertised. i would definitely recommend to any on looking to save money from the big box office stores.",5
The product arrived in a very short time.  The price was very cheap.  I am extremely satisfied.  I would recommend this company to anyone,4
Exact factory replacement for my labeler. Amazon Prime does a great job of saving me time and money as well as gas and wear and tear on my vehicle not to mention the frustration of dealing with traffic and not finding what in need at the stores :-),5
"I am not satisfied with the quality of this product, and I will not recommend this product to others.KK",2
"I've used the Brother labels machines for years and found them to be reliable.  The supplies are kind of pricey but that's typical for dedicated devices with a captive market.  On this tape, though, I noticed that the 1/2&#34; tape they've sold for years is now .47&#34;  Talk about a chiseler's approach to giving the customer less.",3
Was exactly what I needed for my label machine and at a fraction of the cost of what the local stores wanted.,5
"Does what its intended to, with no pain or suffering, depending on the host unit I imagine.  Recommended highly for whoever needs this particular model.",5
I ordered this tape for my father.  He's had no complaints.  It's a quality product for half the retail cost.,5
My Very Old hand tape printer is a relic and tapes hard to find. When you do locate one the cost is more than the device; thus I let this purchase slide for a time until I needed to label something important.,5
"Works great and this is exactly as described.I like this particular type of tape because1) black on white and high contrast2) Width is perfect for file cabinet folders, and handy for other stuff too3) I can cover up a previous label.  Clear labels you must peel off before putting a new one down.",5
I love my brother labeler.  I label everything.  Every parts drawer and toolbox drawer.  It's somehow rewarding and creates a sense of calm to create order in one's life.,5
Needed more tape for the labeler we already had and the new one I just purchased. It always works well and we have never had any issues with them.,5
I use this for labeling boxes in my workshop. The labels stick and the printed stickers make things look a lot more organized.,5
"Pricey, but the print holds well, even outdoors in a New England winter. also the cement is durable. Easy to use.",4
"I love Brother label-makers--they are the easiest to use.  This standard tape is good and has lasted me a long time.  Will not stick on large plastic containers very well, but does fine on smaller containers for holding sugar, coffee, decaf, flour, etc.I wish Brother would make it easier to remove the backing on this labels.  It takes much longer than printing up and printing out the label itself.",4
Great for labels and its easy and works well all kinds of sizes and dimensions . Labels are nice very nice,5
"Found my, like, 13 year old label maker lying around one day.  Cleared out the batteries, put new ones in, was stoked that it even powered up.  Pressed &#34;print&#34;, realized that there was no more tape.  Ordered this, now it's back to life.  I should go label the cat.",5
"I have been using M cartridges for my P-Touch for years to label anything and everything, including all of those pesky cords and chargers that seem to multiply around the house. We kept ending up with boxes of cords and cables that no one quite knew what they went to, and in many cases they went to devices that had been tossed long ago. By labeling cords when they come in the door, I can better keep track of them and eventually dispose of them without fear of reprisal. The adhesive lasts indefinitely (I haven't had any come loose in the time I have been using the product) and the cartridges dispense correctly every time.",5
"I've used this tape for years and have an older Brother labeler to prove it.  Using the tape on clean surfaces is a no-brainer but its not intended to be used on items that have high usage, the printing will eventually wear off, but a new one is easily made up.",5
"this fits the sample package that came with the label maker.  well, the whole new label maker is like double this, so you pay for the labels.",4
"I've been using the Brother label printers for many years now, these are pretty good and of course you need tape for it to work, I'm happy with this purchase.",5
"I've been using this tape for my P-Touch for years and it's great.  One cartridge lasts me forever.  I can label anything, including my children's ice packs and cups.  They stay on in the freezer and in the dishwasher.  The ink doesn't smudge, but after a few years of going through the dishwasher, the ink may fade.  If I need to, I just peel off and make another one.  As long as the surface is non-porous, it comes off when I need it to without any trouble without leaving any residue.  What's not to like?",5
The price on these was excellent. I had shopped around and of course the office supply stores that had them wanted an arm and a leg for one refill. My wife and I love organizing with these little labels.,5
"Yes, I enjoy labeling things - looks neater for labeling kid gear than a Sharpie does.  (Of course, I do love Name Bubbles for the &#34;serious&#34; kid gear/clothes labeling tasks.  I get frustrated when I am out of labels, and having more color options available through Amazon is a good thing.  Having more label tape is good as my kids find the label printer and start printing random stuff.",5
"I got my p-touch like 3 years ago for $9.99 from another website. Trying to find the labels is hard and at Office Depot or Office Max or Staples they are expensive.Here, they are fair priced......of course I would have liked them for like $2.99 each but whatever.",5
"It's a Brother brand tape that I purchased for my Brother P - Touch Labeler. Looks, works, and sticks just like the tape that came with my labeler. And available at less cost than I could find in the local office stores.",5
this replacement tape was a perfect fit for my brother label machine. it was a lot less expensive then if I bought it in the store.,5
"Purchasing in quantity is a great way to buy the M-tape for Brother labelers. I have been using a P-Touch for years, and love it. Practically indestructible. The one I have at my office has to be over 10 years old. Just bought a new P-Touch for home, and hope I get the same service from it. Anyway, the Brother replacement tapes have always been reliable, print well, and they are durable.",5
I use a fair amount of this tape. I tried using this outdoors. That was a mistake. It faded in about 2 days. I sort of knew that would happen. I need to spend the extra money to get the laminated version. As long as you only use it for indoor items it's just fine.,3
Excellent product for about 1/2 as much as you would pay at your local office storeBrother M231 1/2-Inch Black on White Tape for P-Touch Labeler,5
"We use this label maker quite a bit. The refills are first rate. I have not tried the other colors, but the B/W work great",5
"Excellent all-purpose label maker, & this tape works great in it, not much else to say, except it does the job & the labels work.",5
And I would also say that the sticky part has the perfect amount of tackiness. I'd be such a slob without my labelmaker.,5
"I couldn't find this cheaper elsewhere, and the printing on these labels don't seem to fade, nor the stickiness seem to wear off. I only wish they made these with more label and less empty space in the cartridge so I don't have to refill my printer so often.",5
"I love my P-Touch labeler, and use it all the time.This is a much better price than local on the label refills, so I buy them here.Recommended",5
"Works well with label printer and is easy enough to use.  Overall, I don't use the system frequently enough to comment.",4
The Brother M231 1/2-Inch Black on White Tape for P-Touch Labeler is a very good purchase.  I have been using Brother products for years but I especially like this purchase because I can use it for creating files or placing it on the outside of the building for tenant apartments bells so fedex and UPS can locate the tenant for deliveries.  It is a great purchase and I highly recommend it.,5
"black print on white backing tape. easy to install and prints great labels... no faulty letters, everything comes out printed properly.",4
"It works as expected. I installed this black on white tape on a Brother P-Touch Model PT-80. The PT-80 labeler is not available anymore, so I was happy to see that the tape is still available. I am very happy.",5
The P-Touch labeler makes it's easy to label anything.  The quality of the labels are good and work in most situations.,5
"Works Great for the Brother Personal Labeler Machine, White (PT90)! Just like the original one that came with the labeler and great replacement",5
I always have my kids peel the back off the tape cause I run out of patience. Otherwise it's fine.,3
"This Brother P-Touch labeler is what I needed in a pinch for labeling frozen foods.  Small, lightweight and battery operated with a clear, concise operation interface.",5
I love my Brother Ptouch labeler and I purchased more to stock up. This labeler has worked well for us and I use it for everything at home.,4
This cartridge fits well and I've purchased it a few times already. It works well and has no problems. It is authentic and cost effective for our needs: Labeling leftovers in the fridge so that we don't poison ourselves with 2 month old food that should have been thrown out last week.,4
"I've been using the P-Touch PT-80 for over a year and just ran out of tape. The product works great for labeling files, wires, or anything else.I noticed some reviewers said the tape was hard to peel. The PT-80 has a tape peeler feature (just a little slot) that gets the peel started and works like a champ.",5
"I use the tape all the time & it works perfect. looks good & stays perfect. I use it to lable files, spice jars, movie titles on the plastic cases. book cases etc.",5
"Lovely, useful product. Works as expected! But...I would rather pay for a slightly larger labeling machine in order to get a MUCH LARGER (and longer) tape cartridge. If Brother were to increase the label tape length, it would only cost PENNIES to do so.Is Brother's profit important enough to damage the company's public reputation? Why not offer a more equitable cost/value ratio to customers? If the company (Brother) had GIVEN me the labelling machine free of charge, I would be more agreeable to their high prices of the consumables.",4
"I ordered extra tape for the Brother  Personal Handheld Labeler.  Knowing it would be used, the tape was backup for it.",4
This is an excellent Product. I use my label maker for many different applications. This label maker tape still lasts me for several months.,5
I have had no problems with this brand. The price was right and the shipping was fast. I highly recommend Prime with the 2 day shipping. I had mine the next day after ordering.,5
P-Touch Labelers are handy little gadgets that should be in every household. There are all sorts of things that need labels. If you have a P-Touch you will discover the hundreds of things that you never realized would be ever so much better with a label. This black-on-white tape for the P-Touch is the basic label tape that the machine needs to be useful. The tape makes high quality durable glossy labels and works perfectly in the P-Touch machine.,3
the tape is good and works perfectly with my labeler.I used to label most of my family's things.It doesn't work very well with objects that need to wash with hot water or will go to microwave. the ink start to fade out.,3
"I bought two of these with my brother label maker. I have no complaint, they work as described and overall good price. The writing quality is as expected and they lasts pretty long time for me. 26ft is a lot of labels.",5
"So far I have not had problems with any of these cartridges,  I have not found a generic alternative to the company's expensive products, but when I do I will change.  These things are just too expensive for what they are.",5
"The real thing in a Brother package for half the price of store bought.And free shipping.For those that don't know, this is ""crack-back"" tape. Just fold it lengthwise to split the backing and pull it off. No more worrying the edge to get the backing loose. I work with small(2-3 letters) labels, so this really helps.",5
What I like about this labeling tape is the pre-cut line running along the back of the backing paper. It makes it very easy to remove the label from the backing paper when you're ready to stick the label.I did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past. The tape jammed upon installation and I had to throw out a new tape. You can avoid this by being careful during tape installation.,4
I love my Brother label maker and use it in our rental homes. This replacement tape is original Brother (though I have used knock offs and they work perfectly too),5
I purchased this tape as it is manufactured by Brother. I prefer to use replacements designed by the manufacturer of the product. This tape worked perfectly.,5
"Good quality product and looks good. One thing though: it has to feed blank tape so you can cut it, resulting in an inch of lost tape for every print.",4
"I use this 1/2"" tape on all types of surfaces, it sticks well and is easy to read.",5
"There are nickle/dime items that are necessary, but only on occasion, in life. It is good to have a product and a reliable source when that occasion arises!!",5
"I use my P-Touch for church name tags, labels in the file cabinet, shop labels, cable labels and more.  This is a great product and I always keep a spare on hand.",5
"I got my wife the Brother P-Touch labeler (PT-1200 I think) to use in organizing things; primarily the 50 or so 18-gallon plastic tote bins we use to store things in the basement and garage.We've found through a few years of experience that the 1/2&#34; is superior in longevity to the smaller width tapes for labeling these plastic bins -- little to know spontaneous peel-off that you get with a smaller width tape.I think it has something to do with the surface area to volume ratio for the adhesive and the slightly irregular and porous nature of the recycled plastic bins.In any case, we like this -- aside from the durability -- you can print LARGE FONT so you can easily identify the contents from the label from a distance (saves having to take everything out etc.)",4
"I use this tape most often in the kitchen, to label and date spice jars and pantry items.  The labels adhere well to glass and stainless steel, and do not peel off or yellow with time.  I've also used the labels for a home filing system, and after many years, the labels still look crisp and bright.",5
These labeling tapes fits my brother label maker perfectly. Also I found that Amazon had the best price for these labels.,5
"I use this for my Brother PT-1010 and it works great.  No complaints here.  If need a refill, I will buy it here.",5
"This is a good product ..... fresh, just like in the store, only cheaper. I have never had a problem with any cartridges I've bought from Amazon.",5
"Just like I've purchased in office supply stores for years, but a great price.  I've been using the tape for several days and works perfectly.  Recommend to anyone.",5
Just what we were trying to find and couldnt locally.  And the price was so much better than we ever paid before!,5
This labeling tape is perfect for manila folders or really anything you need to label. It is waterproof and does not come off easily. I use it labeling everything from manila folders to binders to toys!,5
genuine Brother tapes are the only way to go!  Clean and correct printing each time.  I like this item.  Thanks!,4
"We use this tape for labeling hanging file folders in our home office; for labeling our tool chest; to label jars of herbs, spices and other food items we buy in bulk; etc.  I even use this tape to label bottles of homemade vanilla extract for our use and to give friends as gifts.  This is a versatile labeling tape for many uses.  The split tape is now easier to remove from the backing, BUT, as another reviewer stated, due to static cling, the bits are sometimes difficult to throw away.  Still a FIVE STAR product, though!UPDATE NOV 2012:  After we fell in love with theEpson LabelWorks LW-400 Label Maker (C51CB70010)where the tapes were more reasonably pricedEpson LabelWorks Standard Tape Cartridge (Black on White) (~1/2 Inch, ~30 Feet) (LC-4WBN9)(competition is good.. now Brother has the better pricing for tapes! so lesson learned is keep an eye on both... or perhaps the answer is to buy one of each unit so you can always get the least expensive tapes?!) and had a better selection such as theEpson LabelWorks Metallic LC Tape Cartridge ~3/4-Inch Black on Gold (LC-5KBM9)and the high visibilityEpson LabelWorks Fluorescent LC Tape Cartridge ~3/4-Inch Black on Yellow (LC-5YBF9)we've been hooked on our Epson and it's tapes.",5
reasonable price ad it works all the time.This product never disappointed me for labeling folders and some asset lists i label them.,4
Is very difficult to peel the label when finished.  But for the price I guess is ok. If you can buy the original doit.,3
Great product.  Very good text.  Backing is very easy to remove and stick labels on to stuff.,5
"Long time user of Brother Labeler & only beef is the price of the replacement cartridges.  This was a good price, but kinda slow shipping.  Otherwise ok.",4
"This tape is so nice. Sticks on everything. I also really love my brother p-touch label maker. Good price too, at the store this item alone was $17! Thanks amazon.",5
"I have a large collection of ""historic family photos"" which needed proper identification. I tried one of the ""photos pens"" from Amazon but it leaked through the paper and ruined a photo. This is not only permanent but looks professional. The cost is secondary here to the functionality. PS - By adjusting the margin setting, printing on the middle font size, and using the return key to create a two line label, you can save valuable tape. Using the ""memory"" function you can avoid typing common entries too many times.Agreed the tape is expensive but it is a class act.",5
"I have used several Brother label makers, all of which use the TZ series tapes.  Of those tapes, my two favorite are black on white in this width and the 3/8"" width.  I prefer the 1/2"" width for hanging file folders because the label fits nicely on the tab.  I like the 3/8"" width (TZ-221) for use with manila folders because the narrower width positions closer to the edge of the tab.There is also a 1/2"" tape that is black on clear.  However, the clear tapes also show any dirt or debris that might be trapped behind the tape.  Thus, if you are in an environment that has even a small amount of dirt or other contamination, it may be readily visible against a light background after the tape is positioned.One other caution regarding these tapes; the backing can be difficult to remove.  The newer tape cartridges have a split backing that is easier to remove than the original single piece backing.  Even so, a certain amount of manual dexterity is required to remove the backing.UPDATE:  Since the time I originally wrote this review, Brother has modified the backing to be in two pieces, making the backing easier to remove.  However, the individual backing pieces can be a pain to throw away because they like to stick to just about everything through static electricity.This tape adheres readily; the print is nicely defined and has a high contrast.  The tape can be slightly difficult to handle.  Overall, this tape is very useful in a variety of applications and one of my two favorite label maker tapes.",5
"Exact replacement of my original tape, works great for what I use it for. I recommend using this replacement tape.",5
"The dealer had the lowest price: 1/5th of the local office supply store! Love these labels and use it for LOTS more than just labeling files; there's a quote on my desk to remind me to breathe and focus. A tiny strip of plastic, changing a life in a tiny way.Have my baseballs in plexicases with a clear Brother label on each with name and info. This stuff is genius!",5
What a deal! I received 3 cartridges of labeling tape with free shipping for LESS than the retail cost of 1 at a B&M store! Free shipping takes a bit longer but that was a choice I was willing to accept.  Product was exactly as what I would expect to receive at a retail store.  I am delighted to get more for my dollar without having to sacrifice on quality. Thanks! Will do business again...and again....and again!!,5
"Great for labeling clothing by size and season (e.g., size 5 winter) and toy bins (dolls, puppets, cars, etc.) and freezer bags.  Haven't had a label come off yet (I've been use the label make for about a year).  Split backing makes taking the back off SOO much easier.  As for wasting the lead tape, I try to print several items together with one or two spaces between the items and then cut at the end--saves a little.",5
"Update 03-14-2010: These tapes can get pricy.  Buying three or four tapes can add up to more than the cost of the printer.  This is how I deal with it.  Order three or more online at Amazon.  Remember, these labels help you organize your life and or business and or customers and I have come to believe the value of this outweighs the cost by a long shot. White on Black is the best as I have tried Black on Clear but if the surface is dark then you can't read the label.  I have used Whit on black but the letters are not as clear - the advantage is it looks classier then the white labels.Three years ago I purchased Brother ptouch PT-1950 (there is an update to this model which is even better) for about $72.00.  It is larger and heavier but you get much better results than the smaller brother PT-1180 which I bought around 2002 and replaced the cutter a couple of years ago.  The PT-1950 has USB and I recommend downloading the update drivers and free software from Brother because it lets you get more out of the tape reviewed here because you can print 3 lines instead of 2 and any font installed on your computer as well as many types of boarders.  You can even save the labels you make and open them later to reprint.  Once you go the USB route and see how nicely you can arrange your labels it is HARD to go back to the little handheld units.Review Starts Here:This is the classic black letters on white tape.The magic: the tape is separated from the backing in the label printer then the letters are burned with a thermal print head from the inside of the tape then it is stuck back down the backing and comes out of the machine. This is why the letters cannot be wiped off even with alcohol or other cleaners.Black letters on white works on all surfaces.  I have used black letters on clear backing which looks nice but requires the label be stuck on a light surface.  If surface is dark it is hard to see the label.  Black on white is also the cheapest most common tape.Brother's price is on the high side and I don't know of any generic aftermarket tapes.  Amazons price is about the best I have found and I trust Amazon.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TIP: Buy three tapes at a time so I don't run out and it makes the cost easier if you take your lumps in one shot!  If you buy the tapes one at a time you will be reluctant to use them when you need them.TIP2: Ways I use brother tapes:On the ends of power cords (like the type that comes with typical wireless router).  By labeling them it make it easy to relocate cords or pack up and move or if a power pack gets separated from what it belongs to it is easy to match up.Car: I label the date and miles I last changed the air filter, fuel filter, or battery, etc.  These labels will last for years in your engine compartment!Customers: sadly I used to label computers with a magic marker! Yuk!  Labels look very professional.  I also add notes such as ""be sure to remove cable x before y"" etc.My ""P3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor"" that I bought on Amazon this summer.  I put a label on it that says something like push ""up"" 3 times to show Watts (which is the only function I use).  I also measured every electronic thing in my house and put a brother label on it that showed the power use when off/on and idle if that applies.I labeled my brother CX4800 computer printer with the info for the generic ink cartridges - Amazon!I will label a flashlight what bulb type PR-xx and where to buy it.  I label hard drives with the size, data I bought it etc so I can see that without removing it to read the label.  If it's for a customer I record the date installed.There's a million uses for these labels and the make your life more organized and better (The bible says God is not a god of chaos - Amen!)",4
I am so glad I switched to the Brother label system (specifically the PT9500PC P-touch Label Maker for the Mac). These cartridges are just a fantastic. Not a single Jam since we left Dynmo!,5
The quality of the product was good I only wish I could order more than one but that is all that was allowed,5
"The Brother Labeler is a great tool around the house. I use it to label my files, tools, kids items, and many other things. The black on white tape is perfect for any job.",4
"It's only 1/2"" wide, but you get great black letters on a sparkling white background.  That slit down the rear--easy splitting backer means no more broken fingernails, no more using the family chisel to expose the adhesive.  What cooler sound than the whirr of a Brother 1280 as your freshly minted label shoots out the side slot, ready to take on the world.  File folders, basement shelves, neighborhood cats--231 organizes them all with finesse.  You won't find a better TZ label tape than TZ231.  Stick it with pride!",5
"These, and their corresponding Brother label printer are a great thing to have. From the occasional labeler to the compulsive labeler and organizer, this is great to have.My wife likes to label spices and foodstuffs, I like to label electrical plugs and AV equimpment wires.Very nice to have.",5
"This tape, when used in the Brothers label maker is superb. The letters are easy to read. Unlike other labels I've used, the backing is easy to peal off. I even labelled the breakers in my electrical panel. I'm glad they have a QWERTY keyboard and not an A-Z dial, makes typing labels a breeze. I recommend typing labels in batches, with a few spaces between each, then print the entire batch, and cut apart with sissors, that minimizes wasted tape.",5
"Well, it's tape, what more is there to say. The TZ231 is Black type on White background, 1/2&quot; in size. This is perfect for labeling DVD cases, or optical discs.",5
It was good to find these labeling tapes at Amazon...at a good price.  They can be expensive in office supply stores.  Tape was in the original packaging and works fine. These Brother labeling machines come in handy for lots of labeling projects and this one is nice because it prints on clear tape.,5
Based on price and availability i bought this product. Although never using one previously i felt that this was the right choice for me. It appears well made and easy to use. Finish is good and does what it suppposed to. That was what i wanted. I would recommend to others.,5
"I got my wife the P1200 labeler and these tapes to help her objective of organizing the entire house.These tapes work well, a few notes:- black on clear are ok, but black on white show up better.  Picking black on white will keep you from having to worry that the dark color of the item you are labeling will hide the type on the label -- for that reason, I favor black on white over black on clear.- Certain items need a wider label to avoid curling and peeling off -- we found 1&#34; work best on 18-gallon storage totes -- 1/2&#34; just doesn't seem to have enough adhesive for the label to last over time.  We use these 1/2&#34; for labeling my daughter's lunch items etc. for daycare.It would be great if Amazon Basics had a replacement item that was a better value -- if you do alot of labeling, these Brother products can get expensive.",3
"After I printed a label, I had a hard time peeling the backing off. It came off in ripped-off pieces; leaving some behind.",3
Very good tape .... just like I have bought in the store for a higher price! Same good quality & cheaper price through Amazon.,5
Brother TZ tapes are the most reliable and durable label tapes we've used.  Generic ones just don't cut it.1/2-inch is our most used size.CLEAR is great when you want to use it on colored folders.,5
"This tape is great!  Very crisp text and very easy to peel off backing and past on to ""things""",5
I love my Brother Labelmaker and this tape is great. Good value for the amount of tape. I'm label happy and it takes me ages to use up.,5
Black on white is the best. It is easier to read than white on black (the letters don't come out as crisp esp when using small font sizes) and black on clear. Black on Clear requires that the background is light or clear. I used to label an old Power Mac G4 Cube computer and it looked great. Other times I tried it on something that was dark and it was hard to read.The special backgrounds can add a more professional look that the universal all purpose white on black. Brother labels are expensive but well worth the benefit which is a more organized home or work life. I have two brother printers: a portable and a desktop which is connected to my computer by USB model PT-1950. You get free software from brother's website and you can save your labels.,4
"The prices for Brother's Labeling Tape on Amazon have gone down significantly from when they where first available on Amazon. Now that they are much more competitively priced, I wouldn't get them anywhere else but here on Amazon.- ""crack and peel"" TapeBrother's ""crack and peel"" tape makes it very easy to remove the backing from the label to expose the adhesive surface. The backing for the label is split/pre-cut along its entire length of the tape.Look Ma, no fingerprints:You can easily crack and peel the top or bottom half or the tape, grab hold of the other half that has the backing still on it to position the tape in the desired location, paste and smooth out the half with the exposed adhesive surface, and finally remove the backing on the other half of the label and smooth out this half of the label.With this method of applying your label, you can avoid leaving any fingerprints on the adhesive side of your label.- Tape for Indoors and OutdoorsBrother's Labeling Tape is designed to withstand weathering, so they are suitable for use indoors or outdoors.---Brother Labeling Tapes are durable and affordable. The ""crack and peel"" feature alone makes it worthwhile to switch to the Brother Labeling System.",5
As described by seller. Clear tape that when used in the P-Touch printer has black letters on the clear background. Works best on white or light colored surfaces.,5
"This works well in our P-Touch machine. We use several different sizes and try to be conservative because of the price, but we have not had any problem with the tape getting &#34;old&#34;. We use it inside, outside, in the heat and in the cold and on utensils that go in the dishwasher and it sticks without fail.",5
I've been using this tape with my labelmaker for years and have been very happy with it. I went to Staples and ofcourse they were out of the black on clear so I went home and ordered on Amazon. I should have done that the first time!,5
"I bought the brother tape titler machine - very good. It is easier than Avery Labels,  I ordered the tape brother TZ131, I thought it was black on white like the sample roll, it is black on clear. I didn't open it. I would really like to just swap the tape for black on white, but it is a problem dealing with internet exchange purchases, It seems such a hassle. I just put it one side. It sour one.",3
"This is a nice tape with limited application. If you want to label a light colored, smooth surface with minimum change to the apperance of the item, this is the tape to use. It would, however, be very difficult to read the black print on a dark surface.",5
this is a good label. sticks well and stays on. only thing is its hard to peel the back of the tape,4
"I used this to label my black glasses and items , works as expected and fits what it says it fits",5
This OEM tape is just as expected and pricing was better than anything local.  We have had nothing but great results with this tape and our Brother labeler.,5
"Glibness aside, I've actually enjoyed this. It's great for doing small network jobs and keeping cables organized. The cartridge is a bit pricey, but worth it. Sticks and stays stuck till you want it unstuck. Pretty good arrangement.",5
"This tape is great.It's 5 stars great.I have 3 colors of MK Tape for my PT70 -1) MK231 Black on White2) MK631 Black on Yellow3) MK232 Red on WhiteAll 3 kinds are really good products.And I'm glad I have all three.It's incredibly easy & quick to switch cartridges in the machine.Just pull one out & stick the other one in.No threading tape through slots or rollers or anything like that.No loose ends of tape dangling out anywhere.No wasted tape whatsoever.It's really a very good simple design.This review is about the Black on Yellow 1/2-inch tape.But I must comment here that the PT70 machine is really a nice little unit in every respect.This MK631 Black on Yellow label tape is very easy to read.Label separates off the backing very easily too.Tape sticks well but you can still remove it to reposition it.I'm 100% happy with it.Can't quite decide whether I like the Black/White or the Black/Yellow the best.Both are very easy to use, very easy to read.Both very nice items.No doubt about it.C SmithMaryland",5
"I love my Label Maker.  I have a home office as well as a shop filled with supplies for our events.  There is something tacky about sharpies and duct tape.  I have 4 different color labels (this one being the green) and so our 4 different setups each get a color.  Then on each label I can put my company info incase it is lost of misplaced.The label material it self is a heat transfer label.  Meaning if it gets hot it will become black.  The green is more of a mint green, which is not an issue unless you are trying to make it match something. Overall, the resulting label is very resilient to fading in the sun, being pealed off of most surfaces (some plastics like Rubbermaid they do not stick to) and the size is very readable in both large and small fonts which my Brother pTouch prints.Now the down sides, which can be big for some people.  I am 27, and for a guy I have nails, which I need to get the backing off.  There is no split down the center like a crack and peal, so you have to try at the corner for a bit.  Once  you do a few you get a method down but it is still a pain if you need to label a ton of things.  (My label maker has an auto cutter so if i have to make 20 of the same label i turn it off, print all 20 on one strip, peal the backing off of the whole thing then cut off the labels one by one with scissors)  The second issue is chemicals.  I have tried to use them in the garage, but brake cleaner, degreaser and some oils will rub the ink right off.  It is weird because it is a heat ink so it must be a layer on top of the label which i am wiping off, but either way I had a flashlight and I tried to clean the oil off of it one day and the label became blank.  The sticker it self was awesome and stayed in place with no problem.Over all a great little label product, 90% of the applications it works perfectly, and the adhesive becomes quite strong over time so they dont fall off in 2 weeks.  If you are labeling automotive stuff or Rubbermaid bins you will need another product.",5
"My Brother P-Touch labeller is several years old now, and it's getting harder and harder to find the &#34;M&#34; series tapes in stores. I love my labeler, as it works well even in sub-zero temperatures (important for me), so it's great that I can find them on Amazon for an extremely reasonable price, especially with free shipping with Prime.",5
this is the color and refills i will always reorder it makes the disc look so professional when you mark a disc with it!!!!!! love it!!,5
This color combo is one of my favorites (the other being Black on Metallic Blue). I've used this type of tape printer for years and love it.,5
"There is nothing especially important to say about this cartridge. They do their job flawlessly.I use it in my BROTHER model PT-70Brother PT-70 Personal Handheld Labeler with special time & date functionIt works well, lasts long, and provides quality labels.And the price is much better on Amazon.Hope this helps you!",5
I hadn't realized that Brother made a tape cartridge that features black on gold. It looks great for Christmas labeling! It also works for Halloween.,5
"I bought this silver tape when my original cartridge of white tape ran out.  As others have mentioned here, it's really a gray more than silver.  The standard white tape provides labels with a little more visibility and contrast, but this silver is better when you don't want the label to stand out quite so much - I used it to label some components in my a/v setup and like the more understated look.  The black lettering is still very legible and the labels end up looking a tad more elegant on the gray.  If high visibility is priority one, go with white tape.  If you want more subtlety, pick the silver.",5
"If you want to label something so that it stands out from the rest, this is it. These do fit the machine very well.",5
It fits my labeler.It does the color scheme as advertised.It's the right width.???It's sticky...What all can you say about tape?,4
This cartridge is by far the best for all your printing needs. The inner tape is thick and clearly sticks to any paper material when the peel off seal is removed. Brother has a nice line of cartridges in various colors so enjoy their products.,5
works great and sticks ok I use alittle glue on some stuff just to keep the corners from flipping up.,5
I've been using this method of labeling for quite some time now and I find that it's alot neater than wriring.,5
This severs its purpose... If you are like me then these things are just for you,5
"Good price for acceptable yellow label tape used in a Brother P-Touch (PT-90). Will probably buy some more, maybe some red and blue versions next time.",4
"If you are looking for a simple-to-use, inexepensive labling machine this is the answer.  The price is right and it is very versatile.",5
Best value anywhere online.  Suits my needs perfectly.  Quality product and excellent price.  Hard to beat that combination anywhere else (online or retail).,5
"When I used this on nametags, it wasn't quite clear; it was kind of frosty looking. Don't know why unless it was made for Brother and not by them.",3
I ordered different widths and colors to mark videotapes for processing.  Some videotapes will be processed at a commercial facility; some I will process myself.  This was I can use color codes to identify which is which.,5
"It is what it is. It works but when removing the tape months later, it seems to leave residues. I had no problems other wise.",4
"I use this to label my jellies and perserves for gift-giving.  I use it to label all my homemade, homebaked goods at Christmas time.  Excellent, water-resistant, and easily dresses up a boring jar with the metallic gold tape.",5
Works great on my label maker.,5
Works as advertised. I try to be organized & having a labler that is quick & easy to use helps.,5
"Label things!  Label all the things!  I like having the colors to coordinate with whatever is being labeled -- battery packs, food canisters, pets, and small children.  So buy this, assuming you have a compatible Brother label printer, and embark on a rainbow of happiness.",5
I love the transparency of this tape and it sticks to a jar or cabinet really well. Fun to use.,5
I use to but this Black on Clear labeling tape and the old stuff was better for me. The Clear part was really clear - now it's sort of a matte clear but it's OK for most things you put it on.,4
This tape is a dull matte silver with black lettering - perfect for my application.  Do not expect shiny silver.,4
The clear tape is great as a way to replace engraving. It does have a gloss like scotch tape and is not quite invisible.,3
"I'm replacing a cartridge for my label maker and this is the right color and size, with a reasonable price.",5
I thought &#34;non - laminated&#34; mean dull surface. It is pretty high gloss. Silver has slight pearl color shift to it. Very nice!,5
Bought this to go with my old (about 10 years) Brother PT-85 P-Touch labeler. This one is black print on yellow tape to stand out against any color surface. Used it so far to label the drawers on my large rolling tool cabinet; easier than having to open numerous drawers while searching for tools. Fits and works perfectly. Nice to know I can still get these cartridges at a good price for this old printer.,5
This works perfectly in the Brother PT-70. The color is eye catching and the labels stick very well. Now I want to try the clear.,5
"I bought the p-touch and wanted some label refills that were black on clear.  this was perfect for me.  Not much to say, but it is what is advertised.",4
"It is the real deal.  What else can I say.  Well, they want me to say more.  Black on clear is more discrete and less showy.  But then again, black on white is easier to read.",5
"I like labeling things... boxes so I know what's in them, devices so I know what they're specifically for, warnings etc.  The great thing about this item is that there is no white strip to show what's there.  The clear background works very nicely against the objects own color(s) making the words look like part of the original.",5
"I use my printer a lot, and this tape (Brother M131 Black on Clear 0.47in X 26.2ft ) was priced right.",5
"I use this on my motorcycle to listen in on the road captain's conversations while tripping down the road with the HOGS. It works very well, especially as a simple monitor, and the &#34;channel switching - swapping&#34; is handy since they change from  22 to 25 and don't tell anyone. Compact - nice package.",4
"The radio is made of great quality, but like others have wrote the range when it's in carry mode is very bad. So if your thinking about using this as a bug out item don't. To use this for a bug out scenario wouldn't work unless the person you're talking to is standing right next to you. In car mode with a antenna it's cool as heck.  It has all the bells and whistles in place back light, weather, rechargeable battery pack with power cord,  and more....Good job Midland",4
"Flexibility comes at a cost in performance and this is no exception. Good product, put together nicely and has tons of features. Minor annoyances: the clip behind the radio is not the best feature, the LCD light does not stay on long enough, and the speaker volume should be louder. Lots of upsides (well covered in other reviews) with some minor but annoying downsides.",4
"Needed a CB for a Jeep Jamboree and will likely only need it once or twice a year. Perfect for this radio. Price is right, easy install, good for a Jeep where there's 0 room for full size perm CB. Did a perm antenna install, ran the coax just to the right of the console, keep the cb in the center console and pull it out when I need it. Can't speak for the portable performance but as an in-car cb, it's perfect for occasional use.",4
I use this in the car when driving long distances through major metropolitan areas - listen to the truckers discuss road conditions.  I can hear pretty good with this.  Talk power may be limited - even though I've got a good roof K40 antenna with a good SWS.  Acess to squelch and volume is is a little trickly while driving.  I wish this unit had adaptive squelch so that I don't need to constantly fiddle with it.,4
This is the best cb range is 4 to 5 miles using a Wilson wi willie external magnetic atenna .  Cb is crystal clear transmitting and receiving. Very well made and love the fact that it can be powered by the cigarette adapter included. I use this cb with my miata club and nobody has a problem keeping in touch with this cb. Love the fact it has the weather channels and that you can lock in your settings. I highly recommend this Cb.,5
"I had a cheaper, non-portable Midland for a few years until it gave out.  Bought this one as a replacement for my car, and it has been worth the extra money.  It has a lot of nice features on it that you would find in higher end CBs for a lot more.  But, what I like best about it besides the features and portability is it's size and ease-of-handling.  It fits nicely in the cup tray or cd stack in my car.  And, the knobs to adjust the squelch and volume are easy to feel and turn without looking at it (so that I can keep my eyes on the road).  It fits well in the hand and is easy to use.  The sound comes in clear, and others tell me that I'm coming through clear.  The speaker isn't the loudest and pretty directional, so you'll have to move it and face it towards you when trying to hear sometimes.  Otherwise, a great little CB.",5
This little radio is feature rich the features just require you to be a half mile or less to the other radios. using the adapter to plug into my trucks antenna I didn't get that more range at the most maybe bumped the range up to a mile and that's it. This radio would be good for a vehicle that didn't have a cb permanent mounted or even a rental when going on vacations to get road reports from semis and to listen to the weather chanel on it. would also be good to have to and talk between two cars on a trip.,4
Midland make a nice portable unit and it has some nice features for its price. this unit comes with 2 battery packs. one is for standard cells and one is for rechargeable cells. it also has a 12v adapter that takes place of the battery adapter and gives you the option to connect a larger antenna which is great if its taken form vehicle to walking. It's built well and it works flawlessly. if your looking for a good combo unit as a backup or as a main unti this is a great little system.,5
"I shopped all around and read hundreds of reviews of hand held  cb s.  I used to travel aback and forth from Tempe az to Chicago when I was in college.  I used a  mounted, cb for eight years and I relied heavily on it to keep me awake and interested during the 36 hour trip.  So, nostalgia set in before Xmas and I bought this unit. And a second one for my son who commutes to college.  The reviews are correct on the short range of the wand antenna on the unit.  Not good.  I bought a lil Wilson magnet antenna.  On the highway today, my radio checks indicated I was getting a transmission range of 5-8 miles.  Not bad at all.  Brought me back to the college commute.  I recommend this device for any of us aging baby boomers (and their kids)  And i should add that the noaa weather channel is great.  Cb radios saved my life a couple of times.  I'm back  in!!!",4
Nice compact little radio that fits on most motorcycles. Ride in a club where many members have these. One of the only suitable CB for a bike that doesn't come with an OEM CB. Range will depend on antenna. Rubber unit that attaches to the radio and is part of the package is good for short distances. Would guess 1/4 mile or so depending on the terrain and conditions. Weather band is a nice feature as is the cigarette lighter external antenna connector. Also comes with two battery packs and a charger for the pack that uses 8 AA rechargeable batteries. I am currently trying eneloop batteries in the unit. The other battery pack holds 6 regular AA batteries. Both battery packs as well as the cigarette adaptor slide on and off easily so you have plenty of options. I don't see why 6 rechargeable batteries couldn't be used i the 6 battery holder. You would just have to charge them in the other pack or a regular charger.,4
"I bought this because of the duality of it's nature.  It can be used as a walkie talkie, with either 6 regular AA batteries or 8 rechargeable batteries which can be charged while in the radio!!Or you can plug it into your vehicle power point and use it with .... just about any kind of cb antenna you may choose.  Just make sure you check the SWR or have someone do it for you if can't do it yourself!!Good sound quality, both as a CB and as a weather radio.AND, when I got it, from the 'used' department at Amazon (bad idea), it was a couple of weeks before I was able to try the 'rechargeable base' to see if it worked. Everything else did, but this item did not. Having hassled with Amazon's chat function a couple times, I wasn't in the mood to deal with them again, so, a quick email to Midland got me a replacement rechargeable battery box that DID work, no charge, no hassle, 3 days in the mail and I'm VERY impressed with Midlands customer service. THANKS VERONICA!!!",5
"Convenient size, great adapter arrangement for use as a mobile CB. Both reception and transmission are very clear. Reception from a distant source can be hard to hear on the built-in speaker. I haven't tried a headset yet, but I think that would help. Range with an external antenna is good -- several miles with no problem.Display is good, but I wish the display had a backlight instead of lights off to the sides and I wish there was a way to keep the lights on when plugged into the car adapter. Lit keys for night use would be nice, too.Solid construction. The one I received was flawless.The removable antenna is really convenient. I added a 27"" collapsible to replace the rubber ducky that it comes with to extend the range when using it as a handheld.",4
If you're in the market for a portable CB option - please do yourself a favor and seriously consider the Midland 75-822.What makes this portable CB option great is that it is a reliable source for inside your vehicle - and you can just as quickly switch out of it and start using it outside of your vehicle.  Which is great when you are traveling convoy-style on a Jeep run or similar activity.  Does it work as well as permanently installed CB?  Maybe not - but this one has worked great for me.,5
I got this for camping in the boonies. I got the antenna to increase the range. It works well. Good for weather reports in the area.,5
"I use this compact CB while traveling and it work just fine, it is small and with the cigarette plug option, I don't have to worry about batteries.",4
"I used this radio on 2000 mile 4 day trip on my harley and worked good the whole time, keep in mind though it only has a 4 watt output so range is lacking compaired to the other bikes i was with.",4
"Glad I didn't need this sooner.  The radio moved on the Super Saver Shipping timeline even with mandatory $10 Standard Shipping.  I could have walked to KY for pick-up in the time standard shipping took.  The vehicle mount antenna ordered same day, standard shipping, from Cricket Ventures, AMZ reseller, arrived four days before the radio.On the other hand, the radio and antenna are superb!  An exceptional package of capabilities, size, and features.  Midland would do well to copy this product architecture across their other families of HT/Mobile products: GMRS/MURS, business band.Buy the radio.  Just don't expect timely delivery.",4
I got this and the cobra Antenna. This thing does not pick up hardly anything I am not sure its even working. I can pick up the weather radio but everything else seems to be crap. I am sending this back NOT HAPPY. It's a good idea but it don't work,1
"Excellent value. Works great, easy to learn/operate. I have not used a CB Radio in years, so was impressed by the scan feature. 3 ways to power it, and auto adapter comes with external antenna connector, no need to buy adapter. Control buttons located handily, easy to navigate. Can recommend.",5
A nice little small radio that works well and and it took minimal effort to hook it up in our vehicle.,4
"Product is solid. The plug-in/portable battery clip on is great along with the ability to plug into an antenna like a lil Wil.Reception is not great, a couple miles, but typical unless you plug into an antenna, again typical. full scan and 9/19 scan is a solid feature.Nothing amazing about it, nothing bad about it. Great back up when cell service is not available.",4
"I didn't want to mess up my dash or drill holes for mounts.  This product fit the bill perfectly!  The volume knob was cracked, and I wasn't going to send it back for that so I purchased some 6mm knobs, and trimmed the base ring off of them, and they look even better than the originals.  See:B008DFA0Y0The best part about this unit is the battery packs, one for normal AA, and one for rechargeable NICAD, and a charger too.  This allows you to go portable and mobile.  The wiring set up for in the vehicle works great, and allows you to put the handset between the driver seat and console, and remove it if you don't want to leave it in the vehicle.  The fact that I can use it out of the vehicle too, is what made me buy this one vice the similar Cobra product.  So far it works great, and I've gotten pretty good range mated up to a tuned Firestik Antennae.  Having weather bands as well is a plus.  Great for 4x4 folks in the field.",5
"I'm not a serious CB user (I use ham and GMRS, mostly) but this is pretty handy to stick in the pickup when I'm pulling the travel trailer for a road trip or camping. Range was about what you'd expect (without skip about the best you can get on CB is around 4- 5 miles with a decent antenna) with a 4 ft. antenna. Don't be too disappointed with radio activity- CB isn't what it used to be, what you'll mostly get is truck drivers if you're on the freeway, and just about nothing anyplace else, although I did pick up a couple of drug dealers conversing in Spanish a few days ago. Recommended if your intention is to have it around in your vehicle for road info..",4
"Don't get me wrong as a handheld as long as your not close to any RFI source ,it's ok. But in my car...A 2005 cobalt ...its worthlessI spent extra money on a magnetic antenna, tried chokes and even bought a noise clipper, nothing made a difference. Then I tried the cheapest uniden handheld CB radio that I had under the same circumstances with the same equipment....antenna...etc.....and guess what no noise. So my advice ....buy a uniden Radio",2
the bad news is these things had their hay day in the 70's  I purchased the one above and im happy with it....But.....there is literally nobody on them anymore!!! maybe some people near a major interstate but thats it....Great if your on an interstate all the time but other than that not so much....but a really nice radio!,5
while I have ham/CB equipment in my cars/car--I really like to have in my most recent car nothing 'installed' and permanent (for now) thanks for a great product!,5
I use it with my mobile unit to keep in contact with the others when we go in the mountains to go rock hounding use mobile for the base unit,5
I have purchased two of these radios and they work great! When we go camping the wife uses one to communicate with me when we are backing up our fifth wheel camper.,5
"If this radio was stolen in would instantly buy another one.This unit has the best of both worlds!  The CB comes with 2 battery packs, one of which is setup for rechargeable batteries.  It also has the mobile adaptor which allows for the unit to be wired into the car for full power and antenna capability. The battery life is really good.  I can go all day and have plenty of power to keep going.I have a Firestick on the back of the Jeep and this really helps out when surrounded by hills.  The handheld is great if you want to step out of the vehicle and still be able to stay connected.  Swapping back and forth between the mobile adaptor and the battery pack takes all of 2 seconds.  It is simple to swap back and forth multiple times a day. (Especially if someone in your off road group continually gets stuck)  The additional weather band has been convenient to have on a few occasions.I have not had any issues whatsoever with range with the short antenna.  The longest distance I have tested was about a 1/4 mile on an expressway, but the reception was clear as day.  I only use the CB when I am with a group and we typically stay within close proximity of each other.  The Firestick drastically changes/increases the range, of course.....So if you are like me and use your radio for recreational use and want it permanently mounted in your car, then this is absolutely the PERFECT radio for you!  Buy a Firestick with the quick disconnect and you can basically have the entire setup up and running in less than 5 minutes.",5
The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the lack of SSB on this unit. Otherwise is is exactly what I have been looking  for. Newer trucks don;t have all the extra room to mount toys like the older trucks did so this fits right on in.,4
"I use this with my Lil' will on my BMW 325iS mainly to talk with truckers about speed traps on longer trips, the unit has very good circuitry for how small it is, and it leaves basically nothing to be desired except I wish there was an option to leave the screen backlighting on.great little unit!",5
"Used it for a couple of months and decided to switch to a VHF radio. Reach is minimal, even two cars driving next to each other doesn't allow for good communication. Go for a talkabout if you look for something simple or a VHF if you want long distance good quality communication.",1
"Before a recent off-road group outing, a CB was on my short list. After reading plenty of reviews I kept finding myself turning back to this. Finally pulled the trigger and ordered one - even picking up a ~$10 savings on a repackaged one from Amazon's Warehouse Deals.I've had such success with the AA battery base attached that I haven't even been deeply tempted to permanently install the unit with a fixed antenna. Here's my take on it after a half dozen trips.Pros - Comes with everything needed to be functional, short of batteries and a fixed mount antenna.- Adequate range on alkaline battery power and stubby antenna.- More than adequate battery life. I did 2 day-long trips before I was tempted - not forced - to change batteries.- Startling clarity. A fellow 4 wheeler asked me what unit I was using, that he wanted to buy one for a backup / handheldCons - might be a minor point - or a technical nightmare - but it'd be mad handy if the unit could be used with 12v power andthe whip antenna..In short - there's not much more to be added to the fine reviews and the strong performance of this unit. For value, clarity, power, versatility and installation flexibility, I can't see this unit getting beat.Update:Relative to the ""Con"" noted above... I emailed Midland support to ask about the 12v / whip antenna issue, and to ask about a replacement volume knob. They very quickly and graciously responded that it is indeed possible to use the unit on 12v power with the included antenna. Here's their clarification:""When you slide the mobile adapter on the bottom of the radio it disconnects the rubber duck antenna on the top of the radio. To avoid that from happening you canplace a small piece of tape on the bottom of the radio over the small squared contact right next to the 2 screws on the bottom of the radio before you slide on the mobile adapter.""A replacement knob was sent as well.I tried out the unit with the 8 AA rechargeable base. Worked great for the trip, staying on a total of 30 hours in scan mode while I ran the batteries out. (Eneloop rechargeables)",5
"Great design for use in any vehicle since it offers flexibility in mounting and connecting options and additionally allows for it to be used as a portable, ie. walkie-talkie.",5
"Nice portable CB! Full 4 watt power and weather channels.Has a extra battery pack and I NEVER thought I'd use the phrase: ""batteries NOT included"".You can plug it into the car 12VDC socket and use it with an external antenna, again NOT included. EZ 7-9 mile range with a decent antenna. About 2 mile range with the little antenna that comes with it.Worth the price!",5
"I'm neither thrilled nor disappointed with this purchase.  For the price, it seems to work well.  Plug it in, press the button, and talk.  People sometimes talk back.  It works.",3
"I should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product.  Handhelds, including this one, are pretty useless without an external antenna.  Perhaps it was defective, but this one wouldn't even pick up a broadcast 50' in front of my truck.  Nonetheless, this would be a great value if it worked.  It includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments.",2
This cb is nice money well spent I. Will love using this unit it come with all you need to start with .,5
"Used it on motorcycle while on a 130 mile trip. Bought the 22540 headset, broke off the headband, and inserted the speaker in helmet. Mic worked well until we hit TS Andrea and it got too wet to understand. Will be using in car too",5
"I returned this item, I found an older production year so I could do the channel mods I wanted, I love the radio, the fact that it can be both a mobile and hand held has corba beat hands down.",3
Nice small unit. The range isn't that great but it picks up the weather stations. Fits right in the glove box.,4
"Nice Unit, has weather band too.  Good range for small unit.  Use on bikes to chat to other riders.",5
It's a nice little unit to test out my motorcycle CB.  It has all the right accesseries & performed as expected. Not so good in high traffic areas.,5
"I am overall pleased with the Midland 75-822 radio. Out of the box I was picking up a few transmissions with the rubber ducky antenna, mostly truckers from the highway about a 1-1.5 miles away, and even some powerhouse channels from across the country. Using these as mobile units you could probably transmit to maybe 1/4-1/2 mile between two identical units with the rubber duckies which isn't bad when you're out in the field with a buddy. Once I had this setup in my Jeep however I was easily receiving transmissions from 5-10 miles away. I have this setup with all FireStik equipment:FireStik II antennaFireStik stud mountFireStik 18' coaxI'm also using a rugged ridge Jeep mount.The total setup yielded 1.0 - 1.2 SWR - pretty darn good on a Jeep.A few notes about using this in your vehicle. It's convenient when you don't want to mount a full size unit within the cab of the vehicle. It's so small that I can store it in my center console or the glove box - which is nice for Jeep owners since you can easily store it away to prevent theft. This unit has all of the functions of a full size CB within a tiny package the size of about a normal CB mic. The sound is very clear and the transmissions come off clear from what I've been told.The only thing I really didn't like about this CB is that the product description says full LED back light, however the back light only stays on for 5 seconds, even when powered via the car adapter. I figured that it would only turn off after a few seconds with the battery pack installed, which makes sense, but there's no reason the light can't stay on when you're in the vehicle. It's also only lit by 2 LEDs - one from each side of the display - not technically full back lighting, but clear enough to read the display from a few feet away. The only issue is when you want to continually toggle channels etc. at night, you've got to keep hitting the light button first. Also, which would be REALLY nice, is to have lighting behind the buttons, sort of like a mobile phone. There is no lighting behind the buttons so you've got to remember where each button is and what they do for night driving.Overall this is a 4 out of 5.",4
"this radio is just great.I purchased this product from Amazon when Midland first came out with this radio.Back in 08 or 10.Have not had a single issue with the radio. It works great, has wonderful shortcut buttons,and in my own thought, much better than the version that Cobra has.Only downside is that the back light does not stay on. but from there on, its great.",5
"The radio works as advertised and I enjoy it very much.  The main reason I ordered it was because you can use it as a portable radio and as an in-auto cb.  With the external whip antenna it works excellent in the truck.  It also is a good price. If you read the specs and know what you are ordering, then you will not be sorry.",5
"It's a nice looking rig and it worked OK with a folding HT antenna affixed to the top.  I could barely get 2 miles range no matter what I did or how I configured it.  I used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and I used it in the car with an external roof-mount antenna.  Both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles (verified during a test with a regular mobile CB on the other end).As I was tightening the external antenna connection to the radio's jack, the radio's jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack.  This was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldn't screw on more than 1/2 turn.  This is very poor workmanship and should never have passed out of QC.I sent it back for a refund.  Spend another $35 to get a full-size name brand CB that is adjustable and tunable and you will be much happier.",2
"Nice radio that does everything I need it to do. Coupled with a Jeep mounted 4ft Firestik, the range is better than expected. Would highly recommend this CB.",5
"I took this little unit on my BMW motorcycle for a 2800 mile spin.  Worked the whole time, even when we were getting rained on.  It didn't really say anything about being water proof, but did OK in light rain.  Buttons were a little small for my gloves, but I don't think this unit was design with Motorcycles in mind.",4
This cb radio is the most awesome cb I've ever owned! And i'v owned a lot of them since the 1970s! This is so easy to go from totally hand held to a  mobile cb and the sound quality is better than my BIG radio!! Just be sure you match it with your antenna when using it as mobile! As with ALL cb radios this is a must do!! There are good swr meters on amazon (or elsewhere if you prefer)Like just about any truck stop or RadioShack.I would definitely recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a new and very versatile cb radio!! Happy CBing!!  UPDATE: If using in a big rig you may want to use an external speaker with it. I could still hear but found myself straining a bit.It takes all of about 2 seconds to plug in a ext.speaker and well worth it.I also use a retractable Mic.keeper (hooked to belt clip)to quickly install in truck.,5
"CB radios were very popular in the 70s. 1 in 10 cars had one! In the mid 90s there was some what of a come back that may have lasted for a couple of years. In 2013 there really are not that many CB radios out there.  This is the reason I think some of the reviewers think their radio doesn't work, there is just nothing for them to pick up!  This being said, CB radio is still alive and used.  Truckers use them so you can always find out what the traffic is like, or where a speed trap is, and there are still people out there with base stations and mobile cbs providing for interesting conversation.  Just not as many as 35 yrs ago.  Having base stations, mobiles, and handhelds in the past I decided to re-enter the cb world with this Midland. It came nicely packaged with everything that is advertised. First I put batteries in it and listened in the house.  Heard truckers on 19 plus found that on 20 there is a whole group of locals that talk on their radios nightly. This was just using the included antenna.  Next I hooked it up to an old Firestik IBA5 Indoor Cb Base Antenna I had stored away, and I was picking up enough transmissions for the radio to be entertaining!  Next day I drove around with the radio in my F150 with the stock antenna and batteries. Nothing.  Not a single thing to be heard.  Last night I put a magnet mount Midland 18-2442 Mobile CB Antenna on top of my truck, and used the unique cable accessory that came with the radio. You snap it on to the bottom of the radio where the battery pack goes, and  you plug one connector into the cigarette lighter and the other to your antenna cable.  The radio pack and this device slide off very easily and slide back on securely, so you can attach it to the radio or take it off in a few seconds.  I ran the cable from the antenna through the door.  Closing the door on it was just fine  with no damage to the cable.  Now for the big test!  I drove 15 miles to work this morning during a major snow storm!  The radio worked like a charm.  I was picking up all the truckers (a lot of them) and getting reports of conditions around the whole area!  The rechargable battery pack allows you to run the radio home off of your AC current, or if you prefer use the regular battery pack for normal batteries, or use the car device with your cigarette lighter.  There are also jacks for a speaker and mike.  So essentially you can use this radio as a base station,  a mobile radio, or as a handheld!  Small enough to just slip in your pocket.  Also the sound, although not really loud, is vey clear and  easy to understand.  Radio also picks up the weather bands. I'm very happy with it.  I haven't transmitted to anybody yet, but I can tell transmit works well by testing it with an old handheld I had.  Distance would be measured by the type of antenna I use and how I tune it. Once I make a few contacts I'll get back here and let you know  how far I got. I buy radios for fun and in the week I've had this I have had a lot of fun with it, and would recommend it if you want to have some fun with cb radio.Update: Yesterday I was in a higher area (in my pick up using the Midland 18-2442 antenna) talking to a base station 7 miles away!  He said the radio sounded good!  So after using it for a few weeks now, I'm very satisfied and really glad I bought it!",5
Purchased this radio as a hold over until I mounted my other radio in the truck.  Worked fine.  Speaker is kinda small so hard to hear at times with the windows down.,4
"Being Extra class ham, I like radios that can ""go with me"".  This radio is a very nice addition!  Hardly ever talk on it, but use it to listen to traffic reports in conjunction with a K30 antenna.  I have received very good reports when i have transmitted with it.  All of it's features work very well as advertised.  I have it mounted in my work truck using a shaped coat hanger. Also, i am using a Radio Shack mic I originally purchased and used for my Icom, and RS ham HTs.  This mic has a 'speaker-out' jack on the connector so I also have an extension speaker hooked up to it.  Has great volume this way, with the convienance of a real mic.  Can't go wrong with this one.  Just get it!!",5
"As hanheld the range is very poor. Forget about using it inside a car, it will not pick anything, not even the weather channels. Running on batteries as a handheld picks up car engine noise from even 3 feet away. Paired with  Midland 18-2442 Mobile CB Antenna for use in the car and while the range has greatly improved, there is a lot of noise, making it hard to understand any conversations. The antenna was tunned with a SWR meter to about 2:1, which is great, but noise still present. NOAA channels were clear the first two days but now barely work. Also picks engine noise. Tried using chokes on DC powerline and also on RF but no luck, engine noise still present.I got this to use on my car as I spend quite sometime on the road but for now I'm quite disappointed after a week of usage and tweaking. It should work right out of the box!Going on a trip to Canada this week so I'll be testing it further (1200mile trip) then i'll decide if to exchange it or just get a refund and look for some other solution.The idea is great. Love it.The implementation sucks. :(",2
Works great. I pretty only use it out on the trail when I'm wheelin. I installed a 4' antenna gets much better reception and range. I like it because I can take it out when I'm done so less chance of someone stealing it. Also very easy to use,5
CB radio is what every trucker needs and this one did me just fine. Like it a lot. Just don't understand why I need to write 20 characters about the product.,5
"I was intent on using an old Cobra 19 in my new SUV but when I tested it (hadnt been used in about eight years) there was no transmitting.  It's not worth getting a $40 and 12 year old unit fixed so I was in the market for a new CB.  Sadly there is no room to easily mount a pro size CB in my Xterra and cubbies and flat spots are scarce.The Midland 75-822 along with the Cobra 75 WXST seem to be better than a handheld only CB.  The Cobra may be nice but the Midland is so much more versatile.  You can use the 75-822 inside or outside of the car with battery power (both adapters for alkaline and rechargeable batteries as is a charger for NIMH or NICAD batteries) and a rubber ducky antenna, outside with batteries and antenna or in car with DC power and an external antenna.  With the rubber duck antenna range is very limited for transmitting but it receives CB and weather okay.  With an external antenna you give up nothing over a ""regular"" CB.  I mounted my antenna to the roof rack and have a 2 ft Firestik FS and a 4 foot Firestick Firefly to use as needed. With the 2 foot reception and transmission are worlds apart from the rubber antenna as is weather.  With the 4 foot antenna I get all three NOAA weather stations and two are 30-40 miles away and transmitting can reach out easily 3-5 miles which is fine for legal CB power.  The main cons I have is the lack of a constant backlight and lack of cover for bnc connector when not using the rubber antenna.",4
"This is a great little CB radio. It's ability to be used in the car/truck with an external antenna, easily hooked up and moved from car to car. OR it can be used as a portable hand held unit. Which is nice if you're a truck driver, backing up and someone is guiding you in the dock, you can hear them over your main CB in the cab.A lot of thought went into this unit. The weather channels, the seperate battery packs. One for rechargeables, and another for regular batteries.Just plug it in to recharge.The quality makes this a solid little unit.",5
"I have owned this radio for Five year's and it is a great radio! If you are going to buy this, to use in your car you ""will"" need to buy a HA-BNC CB ADAPTOR and a ROOF MOUNT ANTENNA or else it will not work inside your car! If you are going to use this for outside! You ""will"" need to buy a HAND HELD RADIO BNC TELESCOPING ANTENNA For longer range use! The small antenna that this comes with has a very short range and you will not be happy with it. Other than that! This is a great radio and has a full 4 watt's output like any other CB radio. I have read some of the bad review's on here and they are so wrong, i had to put my two cents in on this radio! So! Remember,its all about the antenna!!! Thank's",5
"The discription sounded good but after I bought it and put it to use, I found it to be ""not as advertised"" and returned it.",1
"Defective unit, scan function worked 1 out of 30. Battery trays are very poorly made. The eight battery compartment would not power the unit. If the unit was working as designed I would have great concern for the longevity of the battery holders. As they were not straight in the compartments with slight alignment issues. Audio was acceptable and it did bring in the NOAA clearly.",1
I would to have give this one star out of the box I could not get anything the weather channel came in great all the other channels not so much also would say get a outdoor Antenna that help a lot now I can hear some people on radio also the Cigarette Adapter is great the only problem I have is when I hit the gas on my truck I can hear my engine threw the CB speaker which lowers the  quality of the sound I have to shut my truck off so I can not hear my engine threw the CB speaker. I would not buy this CB at all not worth the money and pain the only good channel I found again was the weather channel...Very unhappy with this CB,1
"I ordered the 75-822 in May of 2006.  The receiver went ""deaf"" in August and I returned it to Midland for warranty repair.  They sent me a replacment in September, and by November the receiver had failed in the new one.  The radio will not pick up anything even with the squelch all the way down.  When the radio would receive signals, the audio was so distorted that you could not understand what was being said.  The transmitter in both units still worked.  Don't waste your money.",1
"This does exactly what it is suppossed to do.  I can use it as a portable CB when I am out of the car or in the vehicle with an external CB antena while on the road.  Weather radio is a big plus as it comes in handy whether camping or in the house and expecting bad weather.  Good example - tornado season.  keep the radio with me when going to the basement for weather updates and if worst case happens, then still have comunication with the outside world.",5
"I have a small car without much room for a traditional under dash CB.  I bought this to communicate from car to car on a road trip.  It works quite well.  Car to car range is about 1 mile in heavy urban traffic, about 2 miles on the open road (as long as there is no hill between you and the other car).  Converts quickly to a handheld with the supplied battery pack and short rubber antenna.  Range is only about 1/4 to 1/2 mile in this configuration, but could probably be improved with an extendable antenna. I especially appreciate that Midland supplies different battery packs to take either rechargeable or disposable batteries.Only 1 minor gripe.  The belt clip is spring steel and will scratch any belt you hang it on.  I would prefer a plastic squeeze clip like that found on many cell phones, or on industrial walkie talkies.Other than that I'm very satisfied.",5
"The first thing I noticed about this radio was how quiet it was! In the city there is almost always a ton of background chatter. With the squelch set just over the noise level only talk came through when there was talk that could be heard. I haven't had time to put the radio on the road but I'm impressed so far! It is made to move from car to car and does so easily. A magnet mount antenna and a 12V power port and you're on the air!Included are a &#34;rubber ducky&#34; antenna, alkaline battery pack, and rechargeable battery pack to turn the radio into a walky/talky. The recharge pack is the one point I'm not sure of yet. A power pack can be plugged into the side rather than taking batteries out and putting them back in for charging. What's not clear is which battery type can be used (Ni-Cd or NIMH). Convention would be Ni-Cd. I will do an update at a later time when I find out more. ... Mark",5
"we have a travel trailer and needed a cb radio, which turned out to be hard to find ANYWHERE other than online.  with that said this is a great little tool and we are very happy with the purchase.  i can't speak to how it compares with others since the last cb my husband and i had any contact with was back in the 70's so in that regard this little number is quite an improvement.  :)",5
"I purchased this because of how compact it was however I barely got a 50 foot range with it. I asked the local CB repair shop if there was anything I could do to fix the range on it, they said get a real CB, the compact all in one handset units are not worth it.",2
"I've had CB's since the late 1970's...Cobras, Unidens, and most others.  Midland does, and always has made a good product. This is no different. The handhelds are great if you are in an RV campsite looking for others, or on the road, searching for traffic info.Face it, the 1970's are gone - and even then, power jacked skip talkers ruined a lot of 'otherwise friendly' local chats. In the area I'm working near Canada, I get really tired of 2000-watt skip talking power hounds out of Orlando Florida blasting so hard to talk to someone in LA, that you can't hear your neighbor a mile away. Face it, we aren't buying bad radios, we are being stomped on by illegal users like these guys.Don't think badly of the Midland 75HH. It is a good little 4-watt radio. It's output with a 'Lil Wil' magnet mount antenna is comparable to a Cobra 29LTD with a suitable tuned antenna. Get your SWR 1.1:1 or so on 20, get 1 and 40 as close as you can, and you should have no problems reaching out a few miles. On a good day, you can get 3-5 miles...and that's all they are really designed for.  Don't forget, the more sunspots, the further you can reach...and sunspots are starting to pick up now...Good radio...I gave it 4-stars, because they've never offered this handheld with a mated external magnet-mount antenna...maybe I expect too much...(but you can get almost the same thing in a dash mount, and add an antenna, for the same price).",4
"Cool little radio,  transmits very well,  but reception is very poor. low volume and what seems to be high level of background hum on receive.  Not sure if i can live with it.  Will come back and revise with full eval later.",3
I really like this CB. It has the ability to transmit quite well with a dedicated whip. If you like this sort of thing like I do you will really enjoy its compact size and features. Technology is a trip.,5
"I was looking for a radio in case of emergency situations, and this was the perfect solution.  More people have CB's then any other type of radio because of the truck drivers, so I know there's a better then average chance I could reach someone else in an emergency with this radio.  I live fairly close to one of the busiest freeways in the U.S., and can get a signal with this if I step outside of my house.  I purchased a simple magnetic car antenna, and love how easy it is to swap this from car power to handheld power, so I know I'll be ready either way.the sound isn't super loud, but I can drive with the heater on full blast and the windows cracked on the freeway and hear it if it's near my head.  I've had no complaints about the sound quality, and get fairly good reception (so far 4 miles with the car mounted antenna for certain)Most CB's require a calibrated antenna of a certain length for maximum range, so I'm certain I could get farther range with a smal amount of effort, this functions as well as my old truck mounted CB I had when professionally driving.Great for camping, we talked the whole way down with the car mounts, then kept in touch in the park with the handheld packs.  Has a powersave option that keeps you going as long as your batteries can stand (I had to buy 8 rechargeable AA batteries seperately for the charger pack)  We did have a few issues when on the far side of the park from each other, but getting to higher ground put us back in touch again (this was a mapped distance of 6 miles from hilltop to hilltop)I've had otehr small scale cig lighter powered radios and this one has been better in every reguard.  The unit doesn't overheat, hasn't blown a fuse, and functions just like you'd expect a quality item to.  Standard mounts and plugs for everything but a talk mic.  You can purchase a headset unit, or else you'll have to use this as if it were a Standard CB mic, but you can easily plug any headphone jack in for headphone or external speaker sound.Overall this is a really functional, solidly built, hybrid design for the non-professional driver in need of a radio.  I'd recommend anyone who doesn't wish to purchase and install a full blown CB in their personal vehicle buy one of these, the more people around you with one, the better off you'll be in an emergency situation.",5
"I have this attached to a 2' Firestik on my Jeep and it seems to work just fine for our trail runs where we're within a mile of one another. I really don't use CBs for anything more -- like long-distance chatter with truckers and whatnot. It's got some cool features, but honestly, I haven't used them. Either way, this thing is good for what I use it for. Plus, when camping, we can go mobile with it. 10-4 good buddy.",4
"I needed a CB for when I go off-roading.  After a lot of research, I bought this radio.  In conjunction with a 4' Firefly antenna and a few minutes with an SWR meter, I can send and receive as far as I need to.",5
I gave this as a gift that was well-received. I have been told that it works great and is appreciated.,5
"UPDATEOK, I received a replacement radio from Midland.It took about 2 weeks for the replacement to arrive. It came in a small brown box, not the retail package that I sent it in. All the parts were piled in the box with packing peanuts. The radio and accessories were all fine, not beat up or scratched. I guess it didn't look expensive enough for UPS to bother trying to smash to pieces. The only thing wrong was the wrist strap was not in the box. I probably wouldn't have used it anyway. I put some rechargeable batteries in the battery holder and turned the radio on....and I was receiving skip, so the problem was fixed with what is probably a (refurbished) radio. Looks new though and it works. I should not have had to pay shipping to have a defective radio replaced but that's life. I like the radio!Received the radio and placed the batteries in the battery holder and turned the unit on. Did not receive any CB signals but not too suprised with the flexible antenna. Checked out the weather channels and received them fine. Took the radio out to the truck and installed the vehicle adapter and connected the radio to a Wilson 1000 antenna and flipped through all 40 CB channels....nothing but background hiss. I backed the squelch all the way off and got the same result. Connected the Cobra 75WXST back to the antenna and received skip on almost all channels. Reconnected the 75-822, checked the SWR, all channels below 2, still no CB reception. Packed the radio back in the box, called Midland, sent radio to Midland and now I will wait for a few weeks and think about the extra $10.00 it cost to own this radio due to shipping to Midland. Customer service at Midland was pleasant and spoke english. I could have sent the radio back to abetterwaytobuy but the turn around time from Midland seems to be shorter than the long wait I had the first time from abetterwaytobuy. Also I think that Midland will probably be sure that I get a working unit when they send one back. So, I can't comment much on the radio itself as far as performance but will update this once I get the radio returned.",4
"...and I've owned my 75-830 for more than 10 years.My 75-830 is reliable, compact and its WX weather capability is priceless. (On one occasion, I didn't know that a small rainstorm that I was driving in was actually the leading edge of a hurricane. I did manage to outrun the hurricane, thanks to my good luck in finding out **exactly** what I was driving in.) It can be quickly converted to a CB portable walkie talkie.I do recommend this unit.I got it many years ago, new, on eBay for $45. You can use that for comparison, if you wish to.New addition: Now I own the 75-822 also. -----------------In my opinion, Midland has produced an **extraordinary** unit here.It can be used as a walkie-talkie. It comes with two different battery slide-ons to provide power for this purpose. One slide-on is designed for conventional batteries.  The other slide-on is for rechargeable batteries, and the 75-822 includes an AC power supply to recharge the batteries.It can also be used in a vehicle. Another slide-on is provided for this purpose and will connect it to the 12v plug and to the external antenna. If you use a magnet-base antenna, you can move the entire package from vehicle to vehicle in **less than five minutes.** Time it yourself and by the way, I recommend a magnetic-base antenna* because it is so easy to transfer your CB rig from one car to another.It can be used as NOAA Weather Radio.I now own three CBs, two of them purchased in the last month. Each time I shop around for a new CB, I compare **all** the brands **carefully.** I keep coming back to Midland. I've owned my first Midland (75-830) for more than ten years; It's never failed me.* Remark: Amazon has for sale, the ProComm JBC101, a little stubby ""rubber duckie"" magnetic antenna which you can plop in the **center** of your automobile roof for even radiation in all directions. You can remove it in an instant (for carwash, for example) and put it back again later. I have two magnetic antennas. I didn't pay more than $20 for either one of them.",5
"As a backup for when you are traveling in areas with spotty cellphone coverage this is a nice to have device. Also, listening to drivers is entertaining (unless you are offended by blue language...)Well made, switches into hand portable format in seconds. great range with a vehicle antenna.",4
"Opened the box and was impressed with the appearance. Started to review each piece. The battery packs are a bit flimsy. Put the fresh AA batteries in one pack and 8 rechargables in the other and went outside to try it. Only heard static on the CB bands. Tried the weather bands and heard WX 1 loud and clear. Hooked up the radio in my car and connected the outside antenna, same result on CB bands. Tried a second mobil antenna on car with same results. Checked antenna with another CB and it worked.It appears that the Midland is a very attractive toy but not really a usable CB.Glad I bought it from Amazon so there is no problem returning.",2
I bought this and sent it back almost immediately. It felt really flimsy and the battery pack seemed like a toy.,2
"It works as advertised. You're not going to blow anyone's doors off or get 20 miles with it but, it works. Its not really loud turned all the way up and if you live in an area where cell phone use while drivin is prohibited, this may cause issues with cops as it looks like your texting on a cell phone...(?) I dont how thats going to go over. Basically just tune the channel and squelching it is real easy with the knob on top, the other knob is volume. Fits nice in the hand and easy to use. I've never had to mess with all those other buttons.But anyway, I keep this in my truck to hand to someone else to use on the fly (with rubber duck antenna) so I can communicate with them. I have a peaked and tweaked cobra unit installed in my truck so no matter what this thing is doin I can get to them and pull them in and hear them should we get distanced on the road.",5
This is a small CB it works good and has some nice features.  I would recommend this product if you are looking for a versatile handheld CB.,4
"After reviewing the opinions on this unit a friend of mine and myself decided to make the purchase anyway. There were 5 star and 1 star reviews. After several days of testing the two new units on our motorcycles and while on a 2,000 mile road trip we simply put the units in our saddle bags and never turned them on again. Both transmission and reception distances are shameful. Even when using No ground plane antennas. Straight hand held to hand held transmission distance was only about 300 feet. We also got the same results when transmitting and receiving from a motorcyle that had a built in CB. His Trans and Rec was great but ours was terrible. The unit is fantastic for receiving weather info but it should not be listed to communicate for 2 miles. 2' is more like it.",1
"I have had this radio for about one month now. The speaker stopped working.  I had to buy an external speaker. I saw several complaints about the same issue when I was researching the radio. However, the radio still transmits very well and receives well also. I continue to recommend it but I suggest purchasing an external speaker when you buy the radio.",4
This unit fills a niche for those who want basic CB capabilities in a convenient and flexible form. This is not for people who want great range or will rely on for emergency use.,4
First it's not a big trucker radio it's more your nosey and want to listen in and get weather OR you mudding with friends and u need to be in communication for that its great or on a 4 wheeler,5
"I love this raidio, it worked so good, i had to come back to buy a second!  I was leaning toward a cobra, with some reservations, and when i saw this one, it was the clear winner.",5
"Can be used as either a handheld unit or a permanent install.  Great value as it comes with a battery back for regular AA, a rechargeable battery pack for rechargeable AA's and the vehicle mounted cable for power and signal.",5
I bought this CB radio for my Jeep.  I use it when I am wheeling with my Jeepin' buddies and it works very well.  I like how I can plug it into my Jeep cig lighter or snap on the mobile battery pack and take it on the go.,5
"This little ""convertible"" isn't much bigger than some CB microphones. I'm particularly pleased with the three modes of power; AA batteries, NiMH rechargeables, or 12v vehicle. The mobile vehicle adapter includes both a plug-in cigarette lighter power point and a coax connector for an external antenna. I use the Midland 18-2442 magnetic mount (it will tune to SWR of about 1.5 on channels 1 and 40) to significantly increase the range to several miles, depending on conditions. As a mobile radio, it works pretty well given that it's a one (small) size fits all type of unit. But what I really got this for was to use it as a handheld walkie-talkie. And that's where it truly shines. The provided rubber duckie antenna is nice and short, but it severely limits your transmit range. Use it if you don't need to talk more than a couple hundred yards. I mounted the Cobra HA TA telescoping whip antenna and got a tremendous increase in performance. Battery life is pretty good. The rechargeables will last all day with reasonable usage. Plug it into the charger overnight and you're ready for the next day. The weather alert is a nice feature, too.All in all, a very useful small radio that really comes to life when connected to a decent antenna. Recommended for those who need a versatile CB for automobile and handheld applications.",4
"I really don.t care for CB's but I do drive a lot and this one has saved me a lot of time and money.  Hard to believe that you can get everything you need built in to the mic without having to mount a permanent unit under your dash.  Easily moved from car to car without tools and trouble, I highly recommend this to anyone needing a CB",5
Great CB for light use.  I love that it doesn't have a whole box to mount.  Makes it possible to install discretely without tearing up your dash.  And I love having the weather band.My only gripe is that there is not a black cap to put over the silver portable antenna outlet for a cleaner look when it's mounted in a vehicle.  I have tried to find something to put over it and I keep striking out.  Maybe somebody can suggest something?,4
Purchased this cb from Best Buy.  It would not work with batteries or the power source in the vehicle.  Most difficult to get the battery pack open and off the cb in the beginning but once I made a call to the company I figured out that you must mash a button and slide the battery pack off the cb.  After going through that it didn't work.  I am sending it back and will not be reordering.,1
"I can't tell how well it works because I have yet to receive any voice on any channel, and I live within sight of one of the most-heavily-travelled interstate highways by 18-wheelers.  Maybe reception will improve once it's mounted on my truck with a better antenna - it couldn't get any worse.",3
Ok - my first CB... I love this thing... so far so good. Good quality and looks durable. I did go buy an external antenna to boost reception ($15). I'll be testing this more this weekend when I go off-roading with a buddy and his CB. I recommend this.,5
"Killer Compact CB for motorcycle or any vehicle.  Even if you rarely have need for emergency roadside communication this radio has options that exceed many full size CB radios. Mujltiple freq scanning and programmable favorites.  instant access to the channels you follow. Compact, portable and simple to use.",5
No space in Yukon so just what I needed. Purchased an external speaker so works just like the big boys except for a little less range,4
"Great radio. I bought with to be portable. Has the ability to plug in the cig lighter or use batteries. Also can plug in an antenna if you want. Range is short with the stubby, but that is to be expected. Love that is has the scan feature and weather. For the price it's hard to beat.",4
I purchased this unit for a road trip cross-country. I was very disappointed with the quality. If I could return it at this point I would. Range is less than 1000 feet without an external antenna mounted to the vehicle. I've had other handhelds in the past with much better reception.,2
"The Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB Radio is a solid handheld CB with just a few flaws that prevent it from being absolutely great. If you are looking for a truly portable CB radio this is the one to get bar none. It is important to understand the capabilities of this radio. Many people rate radios poorly because their expectations far exceed the capability of the radio.  Most CB radios are 4 watts which is generally good for a distance of 2-6 miles. As with any radio there are a lot of variability's that will impact the effectiveness of the radio. CB radios are not for long distance communications. If you need long distance comms then you should consider a ham radio which requires a license from the FCC.Pros:+ Multiple methods to power the radio: Car charger, alkaline batteries, and rechargeable batteries+ 4 Watts+ Weather channels work great and can be very valuable+ Quick button to transfer between channels 9 and 19+ Very easy to use+ Radio itself is well built+ Can use high setting for 4 watts or low setting for 1 watt which will save batteriesCons:-The adapter for the car charger and alkaline batteries are very stiff when removing from the radio-Both alkaline and rechargeable battery cases seem delicate especially when being separated to put the batteries in the case. Time will tell how durable these will be over the long run.Recommendations:+ Upgrade your antenna to theCobra HA-TA Hand-Held CB Antennawhich, in my case, significantly improved reception. It is also good to have a backup antenna.+ Get theWILSON 305-38 300-Watt Little Wil Magnet Mount Antennafor your vehicle. You will not get reception if you use the rubber duck antenna in your vehicle.+ Get the bookEmergency Radio Communicationsby Caleb Watts for a good understanding of radio capabilities, rules & regulations, and a good example of an emergency radio plan.Overall Assessment:The Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB Radio is a very flexible CB radio that can be used in multiple situations such as in your vehicle or out hiking. The radio itself is very well made and while the battery cases seem a little problematic they are not a deal breaker but they do cause me to give this radio 4 stars instead of 5.If you are looking for a handheld CB radio the Midland 75-822 is a great choice.",4
"I read a couple reviews that urged me to buy ONLY a new Midland 75-822, but being thrifty I decided to buy an Amazon return product.MISTAKE!! FAIL!!I know you can save money buying refurb, but in this case my refurbed radio was missing the key part: the mobile assembly adapter (i.e. car power/antenna adapter). So, while I could use it at home, it was worthless in the car!I will update my review after I receive the NEW one I just ordered. My suggestion if you buy this (and the product is well regarded):BUY NEW...AND ONLY NEW...IF YOU IGNORE THIS WARNING, BE SURE YOU CHECK FOR ALL THE PARTS AND RETURN IF YOU DON'T GET THEM. I read about so many people that say, ""Well, it was missing so and so, but I just kept it anyway."" NO!Just my 2 cents.BUY NEW!!Update July 2012: I did return the original used radio and bought new. This is a really nice product and I have revised my review to 5 stars.I got this for backup communications in the event cell towers go down (natural or man-made disasters) and I fully believe it will serve wonderfully in that capacity. Just be sure to practice a bit with it and become proficient before you really need it.",5
"Installed this in my 4x4, fits entirely in the center console when I'm not using it. With a 3' Firestik antenna I've had conversations with base stations 20 miles away. Overall love it for being compact and versatile.",5
I bought this because I didnt want to install a hard mount cb. I park on the street. When I park at night all I do is slide it out of the holder and take with me just like my radio face plate. Volume output is barely adequate. I like how the acc plug and exterior ant are integrated into one piece. Makes it easy to talk feel like you have mike on regular cb. I like the buttons for Dual watch and scan which are easy to press by feel when driving. It will beep when sw is made. The receive seems to be good and TX is good. You cant do much with 3.5 watt output!! So much for freedom of choice!! Uncle Sam wont let me up the power. ;) Everyone is abiding by that rule:),4
"be honest . if you buy this (CB transceiver radio) you're going to need a miracle to make if work. i tested with my girl friend.as soon as i walk away 50 meter  from her, i couldn't heard anything and get any signali'm not sure how can people give 5 star review to this product.maybe they all use the external antenna to get better signal.sorry to say that not what i want. i use to have a motorola walkie talkie. work better that this like 100X time.sorry midland CO. i'm not try to destroy your reputation. quality is what we want.",1
"Wow, great unit, like the battery saver, memory keys, scans channels for activity. Battery life is super like other reviews have said. Have to have a cobra adapter to use the magnetic roof mount. The unit does just as well (with roof mount) as my old unit that has the tradition attached mike, and I can take it out easy when parked. I don't talk much, just listen-(the unit is hard to bring up and face to talk because of all the wires attached...)",5
"This packs a lot of features for a decent price. The different power options are great. If you are going to use it for distances farther than car to car, you NEED a bigger antennae or a roof top one",4
"I purchased this through Amazon. The first one was late and determined lost in shipping. Amazon immediately sent another one overnight one day delivery.It worked great accept for the rechargeable battery transceiver and plug. The plug didn't seem to fit completely into the transceiver, so Amazon shipped it back at no cost sent another unit out 2 day post.That unit has the exact same issue. It will not charge rechargeable batteries which is its sole purpose. I even went out and bought eight new Radioshack rechargeable AA, cost $38, to make sure it wasn't the batteries. It wasn't.This unit gets NOA crystal clear in my truck as well, but no CB channels get any reception.Instead of shipping this one back to Amazon for a fourth unit or just returning it and moving on to another CB maker, I called Midland Radio and they are sending me a new rechargeable transceiver and plug. If that doesn't work it goes back and I will buy elsewhere.",2
Worked as expected. Easy to setup using and following instructions. Use it every day. Its a little long but works fine.,5
"This antenna isn't going to provide great range or performance, but it works OK in situations where you can't easily hard wire a CB antenna.  I installed it on my travel trailer window, to avoid drilling a hole in the roof or exterior wall. Works fine for short range CB communications in the campground, which is all I wanted to begin with.",4
No way to set the SWR and an operating range of only a couple car lengths made me regret this purchase.,1
"This through the glass unit performed well enough for my needs as I am only looking for local traffic tie-up information of close-by autos....the problem is that it will not stay on the windshield....I am on my third unit in an attempt to get it to stay on permanently instead of a few weeks....the first one was put on by professional installers of all my 3rd party electronics ... have dealt with them for years as they do excellent work...it fell off and was lost after about 10 days....the second one I put on myself...and followed the directions to an exact degree....including the heating of the glue with a hair dryer for 4 minutes....cleaning the windshield as directed etc etc....using silicon to seal the unit further...this one stayed on for more than a month and then fell off and was lost....the third one was supplied to me directly by Midland at no charge, much to their credit....I havent tried putting on the third one yet because of the weather...I have my fingers crossed....would I buy this again....definitely not.....probably no through the glass units from anyone else either...............",1
"which isn't too long. In fact, only about 200 miles or so. After 36 hours of setting up the adhesive (and I am in the adhesives business!) it should have been ready to use. Driving down the hiway I heard a clatter and clunk and, poof, gone.I see it went from $[...] bucks at Amazon to $[...] thru a market place seller.  But even for a saw buck it is expensive if it flies off the car.To Amazon's credit, they of course took it (the remaining parts) back. But strike against Midland, who wasn't there for 3100 miles of my trip due to poor engineering and design.",1
"unless you are looking for very, VERY short range communication. If you only use the radio for traffic jam info or in a convoy you will not be happy with the performance.I got this to avoid the redneck look, tuned it (1.3:1 highest) and was not getting more than maybe 3/4 mile when I tested with a buddy who has a known good rig in his truck.Put the $18 toward something better and go with a magnet mount or properly grounded body mount antennaMy windows are polarized and from what I understand that can cause issues with these antennas. I've been told that older, non-polarized glass will allow the signal to pass from inside to outside more easily. YMMV",1
Works real nice no trouble with the set screw to hold the antenna in place also has instructions on setting it,5
The antenna was sturdily made and was a better quality than the one I was replacing. The connection points were well thought out to allow ease of installation.,5
"I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.  Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that.  On a positive note, it was very simple to install.",1
"This thing does not work.If you buy it you will throw it away, swr's are always high, and can not be set, it may look cool but that is all it has going fo it.",1
"The biggest thing about this telescope is its size, not how big it is but how SMALL it is. Small means easy to carry, and that means you'll be more motivated to take it out and look at things. More importantly you will take it to good 'dark sky' locations. Even with the Meade deluxe tripod this scope is easily carried with one hand, that and a simple set up make it fun to use. The Super Plossil Zoom eyepiece is a great accessory, and the astrostar lets even clutzs like me find cool things to look at.",5
"I am truly an amateur astronomer.  My childhood was peppered with dime-store telescopes that showed me a new blurry world.  When I got the EXT-90EC I expected little more than a brighter blur.  To my surprise and  delight I was wrong.  Out of the box, in bad lighting conditions,  surrounded by trees, I saw some of the most breath-taking images of the  moon.  In fact, I spent the next six hours observing the moon.  I saw  craters in detail.  I even saw some craters within craters.  I did venture  to a bright star I saw in the sky.  It turned out to be Jupiter.  It was a  highly recognizable Jupiter.  Not another dot in the sky.  I could see  three of Jupiter's moons in orbit.  I couldn't even make out Jupiter's  moons with the naked eye.I tried the telescope during the day for  terrestrial viewing.  Once again I was pleasantly surprised!  The local  river area came alive with wildlife.  The photographic possibilities are  endless!I purchased the #883 Deluxe field tripod, #932 45 Degree  Erecting Prism, #497 Autostar controller, and the #774 hard case with the  telescope.  I highly recommend you do the same.  They all add to the total  experience.  The tripod is a must for both astrological and terrestrial  viewing.  The 45 Degree Erecting Prism is needed for terrestrial viewing.  If you don't use it, your images will be inverted.  The autostar, once  aligned, will position the telescope to any viewable object, and then  continue to track it.  The case is a convenience and insurance policy.",5
"The ETX-90EC has magnification of 48X; great for looking at the moon. However, if you want to look at any planets or stars, you _definitely_ need the optional eyepieces so you can have some control over magnification.  Without these optional eyepieces, you have no control over magnification.",3
"I read all the reviews before buying ... and was a little worried that it might not meet expectations.  But it has worked out great.It was a thrill to see Saturns rings and view Jupiter.  The moon comes through bright and clear.  You can see other heavenly objects (even galaxies!) with it.  You won't see galaxies and nebula in the same detail as you do in books - but you'll see the dim shading of them in parts of the sky.It's compact and portable - so you can bring it to the beach, etc.  Our neighborhood is way to bright to use it for much night-sky viewing - so portability was a must.A scope that gave a better view, at the same price, would have been too big.  And a better portable would have cost too much.  This one was just right for us.  If price is not a problem, get a better portable scope.  If size is not a constraint, then spend less on a larger scope.  Otherwise, this one will do fine.MUST HAVE ADD ONS: A tripod (see my review there).  The computer controller (you'll NEVER find a lot of the night sky objects without one).  One or two good night sky books (to help you find cool objects like binary stars and galaxies).COMPLAINTS: It would be nice for this (and all scopes) to see some pictures of how night-sky objects will really look with it before buying.",4
"The ETX is in many ways a marvelous little scope. Optically, it's far and above most 90mm catadioptric scopes, like the Celestron 90. Mechanically, though, it leaves a bit to be desired. There are a few too many flimsy  plastic parts, the clock drive is not terribly accurate, and the drive  clutch has way too much slop in it.The human engineering aspect leaves a  lot to be desired as well. The finder scope is almost impossible to use as  set up. The mount makes it impossible to view though the scope or finder in  many orientations.  What Meade tried to do here is create a clone of the  $4,000 Questar at a bargain price. Optically they've done well (though it  still falls short of a Questar) but in copying the mechnical design opf the  Questar they had to leave out precisely those details that make the Questar  such a pleasure to use.The $599 price is a little misleading. While  designed for tabaletop use, unless you have a cast concrete tabletop you'll  need a solid tripod to support it, so you can add another $150 right there,  bringing the actual cost to more like $749. And for that price there are a  lot of good choices around. They make not look as slick, but they're a lot  more usable.",3
"I bought ETX-90EC with tripod from the guy in Scottsdale, he claimed that ""he never used it"". Well, he lied and this Mead Telescope was broken, it do not turn left or right, something with the the gears inside of it (I can hear noise of the engines). After research I realized that I can't fix it because it's made very flimsy, so it's unrepairable. Mead customers support sad that they don't have parts for it because it's discontinued and will not repair it (not speaking that it would be costly repair if they had parts).$400 wasted. Don't buy used.If somebody need telescope with broken U-base and tripod, let me know.",1
"We purchased the ETX 125 and we found the Autostar to be necessary.It was very easy to plug into the telescope and turn on, but getting the telescope aligned was another story. The first night we went out with just the Autostar and the telescope, assuming that we would have enough to get started. We were very wrong.In order to align the telescope and get the Autostar working, the unit first asked us to find true north. Yikes! We gave it a rough guess. We were off compleetely, we would find out the next evening. Next was the exact time, which we also guessed on our inaccurate watches. Then we picked the nearest city, which is about 30 minutes away. Then the unit asked us to find two stars in the sky and identify and align them in the telescopes eyepiece. The stars that the Autostar gave us to find were not exactly well-known stars, and they werent in a part of the sky that was devoid of other bright stars. Without a map of the sky, we were lost. Pollox, Rigel, Castor were some of the stars we have come to know well through the Autostar. Needless to say, we did not get the Autostar working that night.The next night, we went out equipped with not only the scope and the Autostar unit, but also a compass (to find north), a detailed map of the sky (to find the stars it was asking us to), and a watch that had accurate time on it. Before we headed out, we took the time to enter in our exact latitude and longitude into the Autostar. That night was a great success. After a short time spent aligning our two base stars in the scope, we were off to explore the universe and beyond. We saw Saturn, Venus, Jupiter, the Pleiades, the Orion Nebula and several Messier objects that evening.I highly recommend the Autostar, but wish that the booklet would have warned us that we needed to be prepared with the compass, star map, latitude/longitude, and exact time to make our experience with it successful. The only drawback to the unit was that it needs to be aligned and reset every time it is used, but its not like there are other competing units to use. Its well worth the money, and enhances the experience with any Meade scope.",4
"The AstroStar is a great ETX accessory. My favorite feature is its &quot;give me a tour of what's good tonight.&quot; It is also great for figuring out what your looking at with its &quot;identify this&quot; feature. The only drawback is you have to be really careful aligning the scope initially to get it to work. The instructions weren't that clear between the scope, the tripod, and the Astrostar book. My recommendations to you, remember to align the scope to true north (i hold a compass on the lens tube), use a bubble level to level the tube, set your watch to the second on the nights you go out, and make sure the viewfinder and scope are well aligned. Do these four things and I guarantee you'll have a great night of viewing.",4
"This controller really became valuable to me after the first 3 or 4 viewing sessions with my new ETX-90EC.  After the newness of just pointing the telescope at the brightest object in the sky wore off, the controller  assisted me with finding all kinds of new objects to look at. It took some  work for me to get the telescope aligned with the controller.  I had to  learn the reference stars that the controller uses to align the telescope.  Once I learned the reference stars, the unit becomes essential for me to  really enjoy this hobby.  I cannot imagine using my telescope without this  controller!",5
"There are two schools of thought on the use of go-to telescopes.  One school believing that it takes away all the skill and fun from astronomy.  however, I'm a believer in the other viewpoint.  I think go-to capability opens up astronomy to the masses and brings the universe just that little bit closer to everyone.  I purchased the Autostar for my ETX about a year ago and it has had extensive use.  Out of the many many times I have used the autostar with the scope, I estimate it has performed as desired on 90% of my viewing nights.  Unusually, I seem to be able to align my ETX rather easily depsite the fact that many people have difficulty.  I think I have had luck on my side as the ETX, while a beautiful scope, can be a little temperamental.  Even after doing a quick and rough alignment, like pointing it in the general direction of due North, without using a compass, I still get very accurate results with the autostar.  I even changed locations the other day, moving from Auckland to Taupo, (some 3 hrs travel distance by car) and inadvertantly used the Auckland co-ordinates while viewing in Taupo.  Suprisingly after alignment, I still got accurate positioning from the autostar.  Once you get the hang of the menu system the autostar is really quite simple to navigate around.  The amount of data is staggering, but given the size of the playground, it's not suprising.  The unit itself is comfortable to hold and the adjustable brightness makes reading the screen simple in the dark.  I havn't found the built in red light at the top of the unit very good as it is just too dim to make out charts etc.  The trusty old torchlight with red nail polish on the lens is hard to beat on that score.  I suggest that if you are operating from a tripod, you attach something to the back of your autostar that lets you hang it up on the tripod when you are not using it. Otherwise it can dangle around and get in the way.  On a couple of occassions I have had the unit fail to operate correctly or reset itself. These have been far and few between, and readily fixed itself.  Ultimately the Autostar is a computer so an occasional reset is not entirely unexpected.  One minor problem I am experiencing at the moment is the scrolling text on the lower line of the display panel is tending to fade a little the faster it scrolls.  This has occured since I started using a power adapter for the scope so this will need investigating. This however is only a minor niggle. If you have any concerns about your Autostar consultthe best resource on the net for the autostar, Mike Weasners site. The Autostar is highly recommended and really an essential purchase to go along with your ETX. Clear skies everyone and happy alignments.",5
"We just purchased the Meade 90 ETX telescope and decided to get the computer controller too - and man are we glad that we did.  We're novices with the telescope, so finding specific objects in the night sky is a challenge.With the autostart, after taking about 15 minutes to go through the alignment process, we can just tell the Autostar what we want to find and it moves the telescope to the object for us.  Without this, the only thing we would probably look at in the sky is the moon.NOTE: If you're not planning to use your telescope to look at objects in the night sky (i.e. planets, etc), then you don't need the Autostar.",5
"I'm a rank astronomy novice. I read the Autostar manual word for word twice before I dared to hook it to my ETX-90 scope. So far the Autostar is far far too complicated for this CPA, MBA to understand. The computer seems very slow to respond to commands. Maybe if I read the Autostar manual another dozen times I'll figure some of it out. Meanwhile I'll use the simple controller that came with my scope. I understand that remote completely.",2
"I have mixed feelings about this category of laptop locks.  It wouldn't stop someone with a pair of good wire cutters.  It will stop the casual impulsive thief who walks by in the library.Anyway, as this particular product goes it is well manufactured and works smoothly.  I use it in the law library (where you know and trust most everyone) if I have to be up and down a lot, like when I'm doing research throughout the library.  It provides a little peace of mind in such situations.Thanks for reading",4
"These are amazing little locks. I bought 3 of these to help deter people from taking my computers. These will not prevent someone that is motivated to steal it, but it will help to prevent someone from just picking it up and walking away with it when you are not looking.",5
"Here's my original review:I bought this because just received a new MBPro 13"" (non-retina) as a gift. I'm headed to help coordinate a conference TOMORROW, so I ordered this lock to protect my laptop. I didn't want a combination lock because I've had those get all mixed up & unusable (thankfully not while connected to my laptop!)Sadly, this lock does not fit the new MBPro. I can't even get the lock into the Kensington slot, PLUS the metal stubs scraped up the surrounding area on my brand new comp! The scrapes aren't a *huge* deal, but I'm sad, given I've only had the comp a couple weeks.Now I'm headed off to Target in hopes of finding something. I'm just sad about the ridiculous price I'm gonna have to pay. If there's something I'm missing, I'd love to hear about it!Here's the UPDATE:After I had no success finding a lock at Target (Best Buy was closed), I came home & worked the lock some more. I finally got it to work, but I'm not sure what I did any differently: I lined up the Tbar with the stubs, put it in the slot, & turned the key to the left. I just hope it doesn't act fussy when I get where I'm going.",3
"I just got back from a two week vacation and I used this  lock for the first time. I looked all over the place and aside from the plumbing under the sinks -- which didn't seem like a good idea -- the only place I could loop it to was the bedframe. This is in no way critical of the device; just you might want to consider what you're going to attach it to.The only flaw was a bit of a burr in the cable sticking through the plastic coating, which I filed down. You might want to inspect it when you take it out of the box so you don't get surprised and bleed all over the place.The cable is of course vulnerable if a thief has a substantial pair of cutters; I lost a bicycle locked with the same kind of cable many years back. But this seems like a good-enough product, considering that limitation.",4
All the stores around here were selling pathetic combo locks I had to return.  This works great.,5
"As a self-employed graphic artist, I bring my laptop with me even on vacations for the sake of work emergencies. It's a 17&#34; MacBook Pro, so it's not small enough for a hotel safe, and I hate leaving it out when I leave the room because I just don't want to tempt housekeeping in that way. Packing it back up to keep it hidden every time I go out has gotten too tiresome, though, so I finally looked around and purchased this security cable.I'm so glad I did.This was a fine fit for my laptop model &#8212;the slot for it is on the right. I wrapped the other end around a closed chair leg, so that if anyone decided to take the laptop, they'd have to take the chair with them too and call attention to themselves. I'm aware that anyone really determined to take it still could, but my laptop being a fairly old model and the security cable being in place, it's really not worth it to the casual snatcher, and that's enough for my peace of mind; it allows me to leave the laptop out on the table, ready for me to log in and get right back to work without having to unpack again and boot up.",5
"Works great - use on an imac computer used for guests in a hotel lobby... so far so good, and it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb...",5
"I can not say it is not safe - as long as it does work. But a moment ago when I picked it from my laptop bag and wanted to lock my laptop with it, I sadly found out that the lockhole was misplaced (God knows what had happened to it) and I could not fit my key in. OK they said they would have a life-time warranty but I hate such kind of trouble. I guess they could provide better product with such a price. Any way since it is a touch lock (I like the design very much) I could still give them 2 stars, but not more.",2
"I read the good reviews and I read the bad ones.  More good ones then bad ones so I decided to check this lock out for myself.Well, ya got this heavy cable, that yes, you can cut thru if you have cutters on hand, which people that are out to steal your unit have on hand, ya got this lock that they say is tamper proof, so someone messes with it and now you can't even unlock it tell you get help, so you have to leave it cause you got to be somewhere like class or work, and now your not in a very good mood.Now that I have one of these I am a bit confused.  Everybody is talking about the cable and the lock and I saw where nobody mentioned the fact that this whole thing is tied to this little T shaped piece of steel that is stuck in this thin piece of either aluminum or plastic and all you have to do is grap it, pull up or down on the lock and it pulls right out with little effort.  Sure, laptop is a little damaged, but the guy who just stole yours doesn't care one bit.As I said in another review, how do I know this, well, I stuck it in my ProBook 4730s which is the thin aluminum type on the side and when I picked it up wrong and grapped it by the lock, the weight of the laptop alone was enough to pull this thing right out, and all I had to do is tap the side of the laptop a bit to bend it back and you really can't even tell it was damaged.If you want to protect your unit, don't walk away from it, and as for this lock idea, it looks good to those that are not out to steal yours, but a joke to those that are.This lock design will slow down a theif about 5 seconds at the most, so if your 6 seconds away from yours, it's gone.PS>this is the only bad review I have written, so keep that in mind if you decide to check this lock thing out with buying one.",1
This computer lock works great with my laptop. The key takes some trial and error to be turned correctly but it all works out in the end.,4
It's not rocket science to make a well functioning laptop lock.  And this one works really well if you (like me) prefer a key over a combo lock.  I only gave it a 4 because the first one that I ordered came with the wrong keys and I had to get a replacement.,4
"This notebook lock and security cable is just that, it works well and has never failed.  The one thing to remember is not to lose any of the two keys provided.",5
"I purchased this security device for my old trusty iBook.  While the laptop is worth like 100.00, it does contain information and programs that are priceless to me.  I am moving overseas and this cable is exactly what I was looking for.The ""T-bar"" fits perfectly into apple's port and is very easy to take off.  I know that some other reviewers were having problems with their newer macbooks so I was a bit concerned.  If you have a ""vintage"" ibook/powerbook/G4 this should serve you well.Remember that this is NOT a heavy duty Chain.  If someone has access to your locked laptop for more than 15 minutes, I can think of a handful of ways to break the cable.  On hindsight, if you leave this attached to a desk while you use the bathroom, I would highly doubt that someone could break this within several minutes.  Although anything is possible...  It is still better than nothing.",5
"The concept and the quality of the product leads me to believe it will work, when needed. It is easy to use, with part wrapped around a stationary object, and the other end entrenched in the computer. Someone trying to steal the computer will break the case if the cable is attached. The cable appears to be heavy duty, and a large pair of nippers would be needed to cut it.",4
"Nothing sucks more than when you are sipping on some tea studying at a coffee shop and you need to go pee.  However, you don't want to leave your lab top unattended.  Thank god I now have this cable to secure my investment.  Its lightweight and convenient.",4
"You'll always have your power cable with your notebook.  What about another cable that helps with security.Leave your laptop alone. It's going to be safe.  I use it on my office, college and even home so nobody is going to move it from its place.If still paranoic, try the Kensington Soniclock Motion Detecting Alarm.  Just like the alarm in your car. Both great security tools.",5
"Pros:- Cable is very strong- Cable isn't bulky- Fits into my laptop- Long enough for me to use- Kensington has a registration process where if you loose your keys, they send you a new replacement set- Comes with a nice small rubber strap thing to wind the lock together when not in use- Sleek feel which doesn't bother the handsCons:- Difficult to lock because sometimes the piece right in front of the locking mechanism turns- The locking mechanism's location makes it a little difficult to insert the key properlyOverall the lock is great. It's a little difficult to lock because of the way it was constructed. Other then the difficulty locking it, the cable is awesome. It's very strong and bends easily so it can be anchored to something. I was very pleased with this lock and it does everything I needed/wanted it to do. I would definitely recommend this to a family member or a friend to use as well.",4
"As one reviewer pointed out succinctly, this is a deterrent. Get up and leave your  laptop for a few minutes, this lock makes a good deterrent from the casual, opportunity-driven thief. No, it won't prevent someone vandalizing your laptop. No, it won't stop a thief with a good cable cutter. So if you see anyone at the cafe or library with a cable cutter, think twice. Oh, you would anyway? I thought so. Some reviewers here must think you have no common sense.  So let's assume you do. You're considering this one because it's a very AFFORDABLE deterrent. Another Kensington with an alarm may appeal to you if you want wander a few feet out of sight of your laptop, and want an audible alarm if someone tries to yank it off -- but then, who in their right mind will try to defeat a laptop with an alarm in a library? It's all a matter of risk assessment. If you think you may be leaving your laptop in a place where passersby possess industrial-grade cable cutters or the knowledge to defeat alarms, then perhaps you don't want to leave our laptop at all.So this affordable little cable is a suitable deterrent where you feel it's appropriate for the risk. A relatively benign public location ... your place of work where your laptop isn't accessible to anyone but employees and staff ...  a hotel, where only the staff have access to your room. These are places where the risk of theft is minimized, and this easy-to-use cable lock is probably quite appropriate.",5
This is an excellent security cable. Long enough to allow one to secure your laptop to something large or fixed to the room construction. I bought this one to replace one that I had a few years ago (my wife abducted it).On my MacBook pro the key-hole for the cable is on the right hand side. The lock works smoothly and reliably.Dr Z.,5
"This lock has a ""Tamper-Evident"" feature. If the lock is tampered with the lock goes into ""lockdown"" mode, and the owner's key will not be able to open the lock.Here's what I was told by Kensington tech support:If anyone tries to open the lock without the proper key, using an alternate key or a pin, etc., the lock will go into ""lockdown"" mode. The company claims you need to hire a locksmith to open a lock once it's in lockdown mode, and they will reimburse you up to $80 of your expenses.This sounds insane to me. The lock should be hard for a thief to open. But I want to be able to open my own lock without professional assistance, even if someone tried to tamper with it.",1
"Works great, but very obvious! Does the job we are asking it to do, with no complaints.  Great that it has two keys.",4
Was on my way to a trade show and worried my laptop might leave me for another.The Kensington did the job.,4
Locks up nicely to any stationary object. Keeps laptop secure from random hands picking it up and taking it. Long enough to secure it and still have freedom to move it around the desk.,5
"Product seems well made, although you can't stop anyone who is determined to bring the necessary tools to cut the cable. Hopefully it will slow someone down, or at least keep an honest person honest.",5
"What it is:  Security lock for Kensington compatible devices.Why you need it:  This is great for a dorm room or other location to provide light security for any Kensington lock compatible device (most laptops and other portable devices have have this security port). I have used them for several years in many environments, and they work very well.Why I like it:  Robust cable that is long enough to secure your item in most locations, reliable lock, Kensington warranty.Summary:  This was a very good deal for the lock itself, which is why I bought 2--my customers are always looking for something like this.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the seller's shipping fees were pretty high.",4
"After reading some of the reviews having to do with MacBooks and this item warping the plastic, I was skeptical.  Since the combination lock versions seem to be incredibly unreliable, I decided to give this one a try, it being a reasonably priced lock.  I haven't had any problems with it so far, using it everyday for about 2 weeks while at work.  It is very easy to use. The only thing you have to make sure is that the main flat part that goes into the slot lines up with the prongs that are on either side. Its sort of hard to explain but once you have it in your hand you will see what I mean.  Once the prongs and flat part are aligned, the lock fits easily into the security slot.  Just give it one good quarter of a turn, and your mac/pc is safe.  I experienced no warping of my MacBook casing, in fact there is a little rubber part that separates the metal lock that the key goes in from your mac, preventing any sort of scratching. Overall a good lock at a reasonable price.",5
"I am very happy with my cable lock. Although it does not make your computer equal to Fort Knox, it will at the very least slow a would-be theif down. I can hang my 8lb laptop off of it, and bounce it up and down  with the cable, and it holds firm (trial conducted over my bed, a heavily  padded surface). I like how the cable swivels around the actual lock to  avoid the cable kinking, and becoming cumbersome. I also like the fact that  it is a key operated system. Although combinations are quicker, they can be  hacked in about 5 minutes of trying, and slipping a key in the lock and  giving a quick turn can't be any simpler. Just remember to keep one key in  a safe place, and write the key serial number down somewhere so a  replacement can be found. For the money, I don't think there is a better  security option for notebook computers, unless you spend the $40 on a  doberman puppy, and train it to attack computer theifs. But that would be  hard. Buy this lock system, and it could save you $3000.",5
"When it comes to notebook physical security you need a device that will deter crimes of opportunity -- such as those presented by leaving your notebook at your desk at work or at a table in a library while you browse the shelves.  If you want to protect your notebook from a determined thief, buy a safe.Most cable security devices are going to provide about the same amount of security so you need to focus on ease of use.  If a device is easy to use, then you're more likely to use it and use it properly.  The Kensington system doesn't get much simpler.  It consists of a cable, which is wrapped around a reasonably unmoveable object, and an attached key lock that attaches directly to your notebook's security slot.Compare the Kensington system with the Curtis 06414 system and you'll probably agree that the Kensington system is far easier to use.  Compare it's 1 piece system to the Curtis system which uses a cable, a seperate metal piece that hooks to the notebook's security slot and a seperate lock that connects that piece to the cable.  That's 3 seperate pieces, a little more effort to hook everything up and the possibility of losing that tiny metal piece the whole system depends on.I've used both the Kensington and the Curtis systems at work and have found the Kensington system to be far easier to use.  I put one key on my keyring, put the other key someplace safe and can toss the cable into my bag and be good to go.  With the Curtis system, I had to make use of its storage bag just so I wouldn't lose the individual pieces.  I'm also sure the extra effort required to setup the Curtis system will prevent some people from using the device as much as they should.The Kensington system costs a little more money, but it is definitely worth it.  It's my choice for my personal notebook.",5
I got mine at a 2nd hand store for a buck and I love it but it does take some wiggling to get out,4
Fits like a glove and very streamline. Works perfectly and keeps your computer safer from the stealing  temptation of others.,4
"Kensington is the best, price is good, the lock is easy and works smoothly.  Another great product from Kensington!",5
"Just received this lock. First impressions are good, the cable is thicker than what you usually see on this type of product. The key is big and easy to locate. The ruber insert keeps your laptop from getting scratched (not really a concern on *this* laptop).I can confirm that the fit is loose but this does not affect how it secures to the device. There is some wiggle room but not enough that it would be able to be shimmied off. Things that I am thinking of now are specific to my laptop. The Kensington slot is right by my system fan, which I have a laptop that blows out 1000 degree air. The metal lock gets very hot. Perhaps being so hot will further deter would be thieves.It's no secret that cable can be cut, the hope is that no one with tools will come across your laptop and have enough time to snatch it.",5
Locks the laptop to a table or a bar or whatever you wrap the cable around. Secure and reliable lockset.,4
"I have three of these and I'm pleased with them. I leave two laptops secured to the desk at all times and the third sits in my laptop backpack ready for travel. These are light, and simple to operate. No complaints. I've used the Kensington brand laptop cables for years - I think since they first came out. I lose them periodically but keep buying more. I highly recommend.As a bonus, it looks like the newer external hard drives are now being made with the laptop security ""hole/notch"" so you can secure these with the security cables also. Very nice. My new Seagate 500GB FreeAgent does for sure but I've seen the security features mentioned in reviews of other drives as well.",5
"I recently bought an LG 55LN5700 Smart TV and was pleasantly surprised to see that it had a Kensington Lock port.This is rather useful since in my country and my neighourhood, it provides me with the peace of mind I need if I go to work or on trips to know that my TV is held securely to my wall.The cable itself is made of good quality and if my 55 inch TV was left to be suspended by the cable, I'm sure it would easily handle the weight.If you have a smart TV with a Kensington Lock port, and you want an extra level of security, I recommend this lock!",5
My daughter used this at school for her computer and it works so well best money I've spent on college,5
"My son leaves for college next week, and may never use this lock. In the instructions, we read about the tamper proof feature. If someone tampers with the lock, you'll see a red line on the lock, and NO key will work. The instructions are to call the 800 number, which I did just to see what the next step we would take. We were told that we would have to call a locksmith, and Kensington would pay up to $80 for the locksmith.So let's say my son is at the college library with his locked computer. He gets up, and someone tampers with it, or maybe some of the kids are just fooling around with it. When he returns, he cannot unlock it from the library table. So now he has to call a locksmith, and wait, possibly missing classes. What if the library is closing, the computer would have to stay there. What if he cannot get a locksmith for a day or so, the locked computer still sits at the library.We bought a combination lock.",4
"I make sure to lock my Laptop up whenever i may be away from it for a long period of time. This lock is very sturdy and quick to enable/disable. Its portable, so I can take it with me on vacation to secure my laptop where ever I am.",5
This product does its job once you learn how to properly operate it. I first tried it on my wife's new hp laptop and it worked well. Then I decided to try it on my macbook and it actually pulled the plastic frame away from the screws on the left side leaving a small hole in the frame. I quickly removed it from my macbook. Since it didn't stay on my macbook long it doesn't seem to have caused any permanent damage but buyer beware if you are using this on a macbook. It will damage the frame.,4
"I thought I was buying the Kensington 64068 but what I received from Amazon was a discontinued 64084 commercial model with an ""HP approved"" logo on the box and black HP-branded keys.  It works Ok but looks cheaper than the model in the illustration.  It's not worth the trouble of returning but I feel somewhat cheated since I saw an identical unit on eBay [...].",3
"Works well on my 27 inch iMac. It's secure enough for sure, but the attachment isn't tight against the computer. it has some jiggle room. doesn't look like this effects the security factor though.",4
I got this lock and the quality was great but it didn't fit. The lock was too wide to fit in the Kensington lock slot on my Macbook Pro. It scratched everything up and then I quit trying. Don't get this lock.,1
"Pros: Thicker than many other cable locks I've owned. Locks and unlocks easily, so you don't have to spend five minutes trying to lock, and then another five minutes trying to unlock, your computer. It DOES wiggle around on my netbook, which is why the rubber bumper is really nice, but doesn't wiggle around on my laptop. So whether you get the 'wiggle' people were talking about depends on the computer slot you're dealing with. It is superior in every way, though, to the Kensington combination lock with the coiled cable, which is what I bought before this one. That one chewed the heck out of the plastic casing on my computer around the slot because it was so difficult to lock!! So if you're choosing between a Kensington combination and a Kensington key, go with the key. Your poor computer casing will thank you.Cons: As others have mentioned, it's a little short. Also I'm a bit concerned about the 'if someone tampers with it you can never unlock it again!!' feature others have mentioned, but I'll deal with that when it happens, if it does. Key is a little bulky to carry.I use this as part of a multi-tiered security system. Of course a lock alone won't stop someone with a bolt cutter. I'm only hoping to slow down a casual 'snatch and grab' thief who might try to take advantage of me taking a quick bathroom break in class or such.",4
"My sister bought this lock for me as I will be going off to college soon. I have a 2011 aluminum 15"" MacBook Pro & this lock works well with it. It took a while to get it to work, but after reading reviews I found out that you have to align the little ""T"" on the lock with the 2 poles by inserting the key & then turning it rightwards. Once you have done that you can just insert it into your laptop & give the key a slight turn! The cable also seems like it would be pretty sturdy to discourage the average thief.",5
Very easy to use on my Dell Inpsiron laptop.  Locks securely to the docking station or to the laptop.  No complaints.,5
"This lock is very easy to use. the only two things you need to carry around are the key and the cable itself. Tie your laptop up wherever you go, especially the library! I live on the ground floor, and my desk is right next to the window. So I keep my laptop locked up even when it's at home, so that any would-be burglar would have a tough time breaking the window and taking off with my notebook. Although, if he really wanted to, he could probably get a pair of wirecutters powerful enough to cut the cable.All in all, this cable makes me feel secure against casual thieves and I recommend it for all laptop users.",4
"Purchased four of these locks for various computers around the house, both portable and desktop types. Took a little while to coordinate the latch/holding pins position to get the lock to insert into the docking slot in the first computer, mostly because of the ease with which the inserted key rotates and how easy it is to inadvertently spin the latching mechanism off-alignment so it will no longer insert properly. But once you've figured out that tidbit the lock becomes simple to operate correctly and the subsequent installations became a breeze to complete.The attached encased steel cable is thick and stout, more than what you might normally see in other installations such as certain retail store tie-down security setups, for instance. This should provide relatively good protection for any computer fastened down with one of these locks. It's not to say that the computer is now impervious to theft, but the would-be thief will now have to have a fairly heavy-duty set of cutters in order to get through this cable. The lock mechanism itself seem pretty solid as well; the sort of force needed to break through one of these would likely inflict more damage to the adjacent computer than to the lock itself.Solid product at a more than reasonable price.",4
Used for laptop at Senior Center so no-one could leave with it.  It was easy to install on laptop and put thru cable hole on desk for security of the laptop.,5
"I bought this cord to deter people from waltzing off with my work laptop. It feels and looks good and sturdy, and doesn't have any obvious glitches or defects, so it's doing there job well in that respect. It is a bit bulky, which works for my work computer (which is ~1&#34; thick at the hinge), but it wouldn't be suitable for my newer ultrabook.",4
"I'm using this lock with a relatively new HP Pavilion laptop, and it seems to be a very nice product for what it's intended to do -- protect your computer in reasonably secure areas. As others have said, it won't stop a bolt cutter, and it could probably be picked given enough time. But in an environment like an office or restaurant, it should be fine.The cable is flexible, and nicely coated so that it doesn't scuff surfaces. The lock mechanism itself works smoothly and seems quite sturdy, and it hasn't scuffed or scratched the laptop even after numerous uses. The only real concern I see: the lock mechanism is significantly bigger in diameter than older locks I've used; so if there's some other connector very close to the security slot on your laptop, you may not be able to use the lock and the connector at the same time.",4
"I admit I don't take this everywhere- I only have it for when I really need it, but in those cases, it works like it should. I use it for my Macbook Pro 13' (2009, and I'm pretty happy with it.",5
"I really love this kensington lock. It just snaps right in. No little plug for the whole is necessary. The part that locks into the whole is built onto the end of the cable. It took me a few minutes to figure out that I had to use the key to attach the lock to the Lap Top but once I figured out how to use it, it is a very quick lock or un-lock. (I could have read the directions but where's the fun in that.)",5
I do a lot of working travel and I'm always wary when I have to leave my laptop in the hotel room. A friend of mine had his stolen from the hotel room and the hotel took no responsibility for the loss. From that moment I decide that I needed a product with excellent reputation so after a good research over the internet I chose the Kensington 64068F Microsaver Notebook Lock and security cable. Of course a thief is a thief but if someone attempts to steal my laptop for sure they are going to have to carry the big desk from the hotel room together!,5
"It does just what it says it'll do: if your PC has a locking slot (almost all do now) and the place where you're working has a secure piece of hardware to secure it the airplane-grade cable (schools, libraries, airports, et. al.), all would-be casual thieves will move on. As for more determined thieves, that's perhaps another story. Back up your data!",5
The lock arrived early and did what it is suppose to do.  It is easy to install and comes with a velcro strip to wrap up the cord when not in use.  Good overall product.,4
"The product is great.  The Chinese who put it together are probably great too.  But the service doesn't exist.  The frame is set back too far from the edge on my new Dell Inspiron.  I don't know - if I was marketing this I would try to find out what PC's it worked on and make a couple drop down lists on the webpage so you could find out, without having to order it, pull it out of the package, see that it doesn't work, try to get it back in the package, buy a roll of tape, pay over half the cost to send it back, and then get know notification that it was received and no notification when it supposedly gets credited back into my account.  When you send it back they have you download two forms.  Each form is the same and contains both forms.  If I wanted to see how angry I could make people, I'd quit my job and go work for them.  I would say that qualifies as non-existent service.",2
"It won't stop somebody with the right cutting tool, but deters random theft when attached. Good product.",4
"It works on my iMac 27&#34;, but the directions didn't help.  It would seem intuitive to just shove it in the computer's rectangular hole made for the lock.  It did, though, require a lot of fidgeting to get it inserted.  I had to hold the barrel from spinning and insert the lock at the same time...very frustrating.  But, it is on now.",4
"So it took me a few minutes to figure out how to line up the little pins and the head thingy.  Once I had that under control, this works just fine.  Inserts and removes easily and the cord doesn't get in the way.  Just goes about its business and does what it is supposed to do.",5
"Shipping was quick and packaging was very adequate for the product. The lock and cable appear to be of good quality. The keys work flawlessly and I prefer over the combination lock models. It was listed and purchased as a used item, but looks new and at half the cost of the new ones. How much abuse can a lock like this take? I have always had good success with purchasing used items through Amazon. If there is ever a problem, it is accepted back immediately.",5
"Durable comes to mind when receiving this product. Easy to install and uninstall. For the price a most have, and a great buy.",5
Works as advertised. The lock can seem a bit finicky until you learn how to lock it right. It works great.,5
"I bought 3 of these this year,  I guess out of habit.  They seem a bit loose where they plug to the slot, but maybe that's normal.  It didn't keep me from buying 2 more of them.",4
"I have been using one of these for a few years and just bought another one for my brother. It's more of a theft deterrent than a theft prevention product. If somebody really wanted to cut the cable or rip the lock out, I'm sure they could. But, it would be easier just steal the laptop right next to it with no lock. That's the reason I use it.",5
"As the picture shows, you loop the lock through a stable object then lock it to the laptop's security slot (some notebooks won't have it, I have an Dell Inspiron which has it).If you leave your notebook computer unattended and there is no one around a determined thief could just break it off of the security slot attached to the computer.  It doesn't feel too stable there.  They would have damaged good however.  This prevents my notebook from being walked away with when I am at the library.  Its worth paying $30 to protect a $2000 toy.",4
"It was easy to connect this to the laptop.  No code to share or remember.  If you know where the keys are, you also know who has access.",5
Appears to be sturdy and function as intended.  No issues.  It will work with a Targus PA400P Defcon security baseplate (but &#34;threading the needle&#34; is a bit tight).,5
"I purchased the Kensington 64068F computer cable and lock because I was familiar with the Kensington Brand. I have been very disappointed with this product, and its use with my HP Pavilion dv6 laptop. The manner in which the key fit into the lock has always been a problem; it has always been difficult to fit in and turn to lock it. I have used it about twenty-five times until an internal part broke off rendering it inoperable. This means a product failure in less than a month. I am concluding that the design of the locking mechanism is faulty. It was not a good buy.",1
"My product came packaged neatly in a clear plastic bag. Comes with two keys with bright orange tags. and a Paper Manual with the code to replace your keys if you ever lose them. Never got the link to the site to work, so codes were practically useless.The cable has two different ends. One end has a lock and attaches to your laptop and the other end is a loop.The end with the lock can swivel, so the lock revolves around the end if the cable ever gets tangled.I wrap the cable around the leg of my desk and pull it through the loop. This way, unless someone has a cable cutter or enough strength to rip the leg off the desk, they should not be able to steal the physical laptop. Unless they were aiming for the Hard Drive, graphics card, or DDR3 RAM; that would be a different story.Cable is almost no different than the heavy duty bicycle security cables. It has a diameter of roughly ~&#60; 1 cm. So a decent cable cutter can cut the cable in half.This is only a simple way to ward off thieves in a very basic environment. Better than nothing.&#62;&#62;&#62;Final Thoughts&#60;&#60;&#60; I only got this since I needed to use my laptop on my desk at my part-time job, and I can't be bothered constantly locking my laptop in the cabinet every time I step away from the desk.Keeps thieves from stealing your entire laptop. If they were aiming at the components of your laptop, all they need is a Phillips screwdriver and plastic gloves. Or if they had a good compact cable cutter, which nowadays are quite small.For ~$31, not a bad deal. TO me was better than a retractable cable as those are weaker and thinner. The long cable is good if I ever needed the extra length.Fits in my ASUS 15.6 inch N53SV-EH72 laptop and my Acer 14 inch V5-471P-6498 laptop.May recommend to others, I don't know how long it would keep thieves off my laptop but something is better than nothing. :D",5
"This product does a great job of theft deterrent.  I say theft deterrent because a determined thief with a pair of strong wire cutters could probably get through it. However this is the case with any cable-lock.Non the less, the cable itself is thick and high quality.  The thicker design makes it both look and feel sturdier as well as more deterring to a thief than some other, thinner cables I've seen.  Its black plastic coating helps to make it more aesthetically pleasing and keep the metal from rubbing against my wooden desk.  Like many other cables this one uses a loop design as the anchor.While the thicker design is great for strength it lacks flexibility (the only downfall of the entire product).  While this cable is capable of making sharp turns, it takes a lot of effort.  If you have a sharp bend near the lock it could put a lot of torque on your computer.The actual lock is free to rotate to keep the cable from twisting.  The lock uses a barrel key and comes with two copies, allowing me to keep one on my key chain and a spare in my safe (additional keys can be order through Kensington using the ID number on the side of the keys, should you need them).  When deciding between cables, I decided on one with a key because I travel around a lot and wanted to be able to quickly lock and unlock my computer.Overall, this is a great product.  I currently only need one but should the need arise, I would certainly a second!Pros:- Thick cable- Long cable- Aesthetically pleasing- Two keysCons:- Not very flexible",5
"The track ball often slips by the sensors on the mouse, causing it to not pick up certain motions. There are better track ball mice out there.",2
"I liked this mouse fine -- and the first time it went out on me in a relatively short amount of time I figured I would give it the benefit of the doubt and get another. The second one, also, lasted only a very short time (less than 6 months). Then I got a third one, and this one started acting screwy within the first few months. It is AWFUL. I can't believe they charge this much for something so lame.Don't waste your money.",2
"I did my homework, and though I knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model, I still thought that overall many people had been happy with it.  I have used trackballs before to a limited extent, and my husband has the Kensington Optical Trackball with the cool red glow, but I wanted something that would better match my Mac.  Well, forget about that. The Orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use...I had cleaned it several times in the first week, and I am a clean freak where the area around my Mac is concerned.  I found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place. After two weeks I sent this back to AMAZON.  It is pretty, it SHOULD work better, but after thinking it over I ditched ""matching"", went out to Staples and tried the Logitech Marble Mouse. It is a great fit for my hand, and now resides on my desk.  The marble mouse is cheaper too, which is odd.  If I hadn't wanted a trackball right away I would have bought it at AMAZON. Your options aren't that great pricewise as far as trackballs go, which makes the Marble Mouse a really good deal, unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed.",2
"I ORDERED THIS AND USED IT FOR 1 MONTH, THEN IT STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER.I NOW AM WITHOUT A TRACK BALL.",2
"and then it moves erratically, or will only go sideways...drives me nuts. I will get the Expert Mouse trackball. Wish they had an optic one",1
"Quite seriously, I don't have to wear the carpal tunnel cuff now. I don't have to keep looking for room to move the mouse on my little typing area. I set the controls to &#34;FAST&#34; and it just barely takes a tiny bit of fingertip action to get all the way across my screen. When I click both left and right buttons at the same time I can leap tall buildings at a single bound -- AND have barbecued Kryptonite for lunch.Yes, this really is a seriously good computer tool and I strongly recommend you get one to save your wrists.",5
I went to the store and tried a lot of these; this is the most comfortable one to me.  Plug & play. easy to use.  PS2 or USB.,5
It is not the best mouse but you get used to it.,4
"Bleck, bleck, bleck! Don't let this trackball sour you from the concept. Trackballs themselves are MUCH better and MUCH easier on your hands, wrists, and arms then regular mice, but this one is a real stinker.First off, it's FAR too heavy. The ball is mechanical, NOT optical, so it makes for slow, plodding, difficult motions. It's a chore to push your cursor across the screen and it really causes a lot of fatigue in your hands and fingers.Secondly, it's just not as comfortable as other, similar designed trackballs like the MUCH easier and OPTICAL Marble Mouse by Logitech. This one is just too wide in the base for me and the buttons were too far stretched apart. There wasn't any natural &quot;drapping&quot; of the hand on this design.Thirdly, it's WAY overpriced. For ten dollars less you can get an optical trackball which will give you a lot more percision with a lot less effort.For those who like this style, I highly recommend you opt for the Logitech Marble Mouse. At about $20, it's a much better value. I used one for about five years and noticed a GREAT reduction in wrist pain.For those wanting more options (such as scroll wheels and such), I would suggest the very well designed Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman. It's what I upgraded to after using the Marble Mouse for so many years. It does require a slight change in position of hand, but it stays away from those horridly uncomfortable thumb-wheel designs you see; you still use your fingers to roll the main ball around.Do yourself a favor and get a trackball. Just make sure it's an optical one instead of a mechanical one. You'll really be thankful you did and you'll notice improvement and relief from wrist/hand/arm pain.",1
"I now buy nothing but Kensington mice and trackballs. They are built well and have superior drivers. The Orbit is a great entry level trackball I got for my son's Mac Mini. I use Expert Mice on my three Macs (1 home, 2 at work). The orbit gets 4 stars only because the Kensington Expert mouse is so much better.Add in a no questions asked 5 year warranty and you have no worries.My only complaint about Kensington? no bluetooth yet.",4
"This was a good starter card for watching television through my computer. It worked well with Windows 98, but if you were thinking of using it with any operating system released this century, you'd find yourself out of luck. Initially, with 98, I thought very highly of the TV Wonder. However, upon upgrading to Windows 2000, I had to download extra drivers from ATI which ended up locking up the computer after watching TV for more than a few minutes. After that, I thought XP would handle it a little better. Unfortunately, it was worse. I couldn't find any software support from ATI that would co-exist with Windows XP, and have yet to.In retrospect, I probably should have gone with the TV Wonder VE which is compatible with Windows XP after downloading an updated driver from ATI's site.",2
"I've probably invested more than ten hours into getting this thing to work. Windows will always open an Explorer Window on an ATI directory every time you start the OS and you have to use Regedit to put quotes around the multimedia software directory paths. Also, I had it working for several months until I purchased a digital camcorder. Installing the camcorder drivers disabled the TV tuner and no amound of uninstall-reinstall could get it to work again. ATI support has not been any help. ""Googleing"" the web and newsgroups has revealed that the ATI TV Wonder is a nightmare for many people.",1
"I think this is a good product if you plan to use it as intended. those that have incompatible graphics cards will run into serious problems, but otherwise this is a great product that gets the job done.",4
"What happens, is that PCI TV cards clog up your PCI bus bandwidth, slowing down the computer while the viewer is on, especilly on a older computer with a PCI / Non-AGP video card. You are also not able to have the TV viewer on while playing games with either PCI or AGP video card.  If a scheduled show brings up the TV while you are playing a game, the game, ATI player (most common), both, or the whole computer will crash!This doesn't get a 1 rating, because of the great software features.  Still and motion video capture is awesome.  The scheduler is great, though useless to gamers with this particlular card (see above).  ATI TV cards are better than the other TV cards out there when it comes to the features.  It is better than microsoft webtv too built into windows 98 also.Just get ATI-TV with the AMC ribbon cable connector if you have an older computer (ATI Pro Turbo, Expression, RageII+ or older video card), or the new ATI All-In Wonder (Radeon is newest) if you have a newer one.  Just don't get this card (ATI-TV-Wonder) or any other PCI bus TV Card.If you have a non-ATI video card, then you are stuck with this card, as it is compatible with non-ATI cards, but ATI-TV and the All-InWonder require ATI Graphics.  But in any case, there is no integrated solution for gaming as of yet (ATI video cards are not good enough for serious 3D gaming) unless you can get a multi-video card system running.",3
"I purchased the lower end version of this product, the TV Wonder VE. It has met all my needs in a TV Tuner card to go in the PCI slot of my low-end emachine.My emachine did come with a ATI video card, so I think that  made it really easy. It also accepts composite input, something I haven't  tried yet.Had a minor audio issue with this product. Called support, got  a stupid person once, helpful person the next time I called.Overall good  product, I assume the regular more expensive product is even better.",5
"This card may be fine for just watching TV on your PC, but for video capturing, the quality is horrible. You cannot capture above 240 pixels height-wise, and this severely limits the card in my opinion. I was expecting 480x480 capture ability (Which is present in their much much older product, the ATi All-In-Wonder.. over 4 years old!), but did not find any. Add on to that the fact that the MPEG1/MPEG2 encoding is done through software (not hardware), and horribly at that.. the card just isn't worth the price tag.Perhaps the only good part about this product was that the install went smoothly. Well, kind of. The package doesn't contain software for Windows 2000. You have to go to ATi's website and download beta software/drivers. It takes about 3 reboots to get the card installed completely in Windows 2000. No biggie.If you want a decent capture card, either get an ATi All-In-Wonder Radeon, or wait for nVidia's new &quot;Personal Cinema&quot; to come out (supports everything the AIW does, plus it has a remote, and you can view both TV/VGA at the same time!) I think I'll just save up my money and get a Sony DV &lt;-&gt; Analog converter box. Now that's quality.",1
"I am very happy with the speakers they are great. They are not the loudest out there but it's amazing that they are as loud as they are considering the satelites fit in the palm of your hand.My only complaint is that Yamaha was offering a rebate when I bought these speakers and I sent in all  the nessecary stuff, reciept, rebate form and the UPC from the box. Then I  got a postcard from Yamaha saying that they needed the UPC. And since I  sent them the original I was out of luck.",4
"What wonderful speakers these are! I read the reviews here on Amazon and decided to use my gift certificates (courtesy of echo.com) towards these speakers.  I admit, when I pulled them out of the box they looked awfully weenie. After pluggin' them in and firing up good old winamp, their quality blew me away. The human voice sounds so convincing through the 2 inch satellite speakers, and the subwoofer compliments them perfectly. Unlike other systems I've heard, the sub &quot;knows&quot; when NOT to broadcast- the resulting response is amazing.My only qualms about ordering this system is that its packing weight- 18 lbs- carries a corresponding shipping cost of a little over 8 bucks. Well worth it but something to consider when figuring the final cost. ... .I'd recommend this system to anybody! Check it out!",5
"I used this speaker set for more than half a year now, and it served me great.  The sound quality is good (don't expect hi-fi quality sound, of course).  The sub-woofer is sounds great, too.  At the back it can accept 2 line input, so I can connect my 2 PC to the same box w/o problem.  Generally, it is a very good computer speaker.",5
"I bought these speakers to complement my Macintosh/Linux machine. For my purposes (watching DVD's, listening to MP3's, and general fooling around), they are perfect. The price is simply unreal for the quality these speakers  have.Look elsewhere for speakers to replace your stereo, however. These  are THIRTY WATT speakers. You arent going to find punchy bass for the likes  of hip-hop, rap, and other bass-heavy music.These speakers provide rich,  clear sound at normal to loudish levels (fills my house!).I would give  them a 4.5 out of five stars, but I wasnt able to. I wholly recommend these  to anyone who is looking for speakers for their computer.",4
"I have this 3-pieces set, cost me 69.99 b4 rebate, once I set up and play on my CD walkman first, yes! this is a good set for the price, deep, no boomy bass, clear mid and treble, but somehow the mid-high sounds a little bit awfulthis set is much better than any 3-peices set I had till I got JVC desktop stereo+Sony woofer, then I gave away, and they says this speaker set sounds very good",4
"I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!",3
"As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" and a former radio disc-jockey (That worked in several electronic stores),, I am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60's and 70's.TEAC AD500 Combination CD/Cassette DeckIf you are looking for a very good unit that will play both CD's and tapes, this is a wise choice.Teac has a strong reputation and quality for those that don't see the justification for spending more then 215.00 to 225.00.There are a couple of terrific features included in this unit.  The headphone jack has a volume control and the tape deck has pitch control.  If you have ever found a tape sounding too fast or a bit on the slow side, you can adjust the pitch for normal playback.The entire AD500 is under twelve pounds.As always try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.  Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent""",4
"I use it to convert old tapes to CD (via computer), as well as playing CDs and cassettes on it. Having the two media in one unit is a real space saver and convenient, too. The mechanicals and sound performance are excellent. Headphones port with its own vol. contol a nice feature. Thanks, Teac.",5
"We're dinosaurs that still have come cassette tapes we like to listen to (and good luck finding a cheapo deck to use with a higher end stereo system)  This little gem combines a single cd with cassette.  I like the auto repeat function.  The size and price and combo unit had great appeal.  Never used the remote, so don't know.  Easy to ""install"" and use right away - no complex hookup needed.  I don't have any complaints about the sound quality or functionality of this unit.",5
"Let me start by saying that when I scanned all of my CDs in to iTunes to work with my iPod and iPhone, I deliberated long and hard about the compression rate I would use, and I finally settled on 320-bit AAC with explicit stereo, because I really could tell the difference between various setting after comparing them with carefully chosen songs.  And I do regret a bit not having done Apple Lossless Format now.  By this I'm trying to say I have sensitive ears.I was so looking forward to the TEAC AD-500 to solve all my problems.  (1) I really wanted to be able to control cassettes with a remote control and (2) I wanted a ""real"" single-disc CD Player that functioned as such, instead of using a DVD player to play CDs, which is slower and inconvenient--the track number is not displayed, the ""screen saver"" often engages so you have to hit buttons more than once after a time, etc.The first thing I did when I unpacked the TEAC AD-500 was to set it up and attached it to my tuner so that I compare it against my existing equipment.  The cassette player was the most disappointing.  I currently have a Pioneer CT-W606DR, which remains the best sounding cassette player I have ever encountered or read about online (that has a reasonable cost).  I chose two cassettes to compare mainly because I new that the magnetic tape in them was in excellent condition and has great sound quality.  These were ""The Dealer"" by Chico Hamilton and ""Introspective"" by the Pet Shop Boys.  I tried both with speakers and with headphones.  The TEAC sounded pretty good, I must admit.  However, when you compare it against my current Pioneer, it paled in comparison.  The Pioneer had far greater treble response, yielding a far more vibrant and crisp sound.  There was also a far greater ""depth"" with the Pioneer--that feeling that you can reach into the sound to touch the individual instruments.  I should say that I had Dolby noise reduction off on both units.  I mean, the TEAC does sound far better than my two Sony cassette walkmen.  However, the promise of a remote control was not enough for fogive the lesser sound quality.The CD section of the TEAC is less dissapointing.  I was comparing it to a Sony DVD-Recorder RDR-GXD455.  The similarity was much closer here.  However, I have to say that the Sony came out slightly ahead of the TEAC.  The tonal quality of the reproduction was a bit richer and the highs were a bit more crisp.  This might boil down more to a matter of personal preference rather than absolute superiority.So, alas, I'm going to return this unit and limp a long with the functional deficiencies in my current equipment in exchange for better sound quality.",3
Hard to find a cd / cassette deck combination in this day.  Seems to be the best price for the unit.,4
"As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" and a former radio disc-jockey (That worked in several electronic stores), I am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60's and 70's.TEAC W-600R Dual Full-Logic CassetteThe Teac unit gives you the ability to play on both portions of the deck and record on one.

Very few decks (Especially in the price range of 100.00) were able to offer trouble free high-speed dubbing.The old saying you get what you pay for is realistic.

I bought this to transfer old cassettes to disc. It has been a wonder to work with. I have found nothing that doesn't work beyond expectations. With the auto-reverse I just start it up and copy the whole tape to pc in no time at all. Playback on the cassette deck is great.,5
"At first blush, this unit looks promising (keeping in mind that one shouldn't expect miracles given the selling price, etc.). One of the cassette mechanisms on this particular TEAC W-600R developed a loud electronic hum (which had also translated to the Recording as well as the Playback mode) after only 3 weeks of extremely light use - a virtual out-of-box failure. I returned the item for a replacement (ever the Optimist or simply too stupid to know better) and am awaiting the new unit. I must add that, unfortunately, my experience with TEAC products has always been disappointing at best (at present, I have 3 TEAC products and all suffer from a malfunction of some sort on at least one of the features). I actually purchased this W-600R to ""replace"" (via AUX) the suddenly non-functioning cassete decks on my TEAC DC-D2831 Compact Hi-Fi System (rather than trash the whole System). Those just quit out-of-the-blue. These failures seem to happen too regularly to attribute to a series of coincidences. Just saying ""beware"", I suppose. Sometimes a bargain isn't always a bargain.",2
great if you need this to type of unit and still play your old cassettes. Also useful if you want to transfer your cassettes to CDs or DVDs.,4
"After owning a Teac tape recorder since 1983 that I was very happy with, I wanted a second one so I purchased this unit. What a dissapointment. It cliked and clanked when the tape engaged. It didn't have a earphone jack--my fault, I should have looked closer. After a couple weeks of use it wouldn't accept the audio feed in order to record so I returned it.",2
"Nice controls, a solid chassis, easy to use remote.  The standout feature for me is that the transport is absolutely silent when playing---no hiss or hum from the motors (I mean if you put your ear up to the component itself---not the lack of noise on the audio outputs, which should be a given with any but the cheapest disc player).  The error-correction algorithms are excellent---I played some badly scratched CDs that other players could not handle and could barely hear the data interpolation at the scratch points.  I would give it five stars but for two things--- (1) occasional speaker pop on power-up (easily resolved if you use a delay circuit or just turn your power amp/receiver on last when powering up your system), and (2) limited programming/playback options---there doesn't seem to be any way to set the unit to play just a single CD straight through (without creating a program containing all the tracks of that CD).  The internal DAC is not bad, and of course the optical output lets you hook up your DAC of choice.  Bottom line, this is a GREAT bargain in Red Book changers, well worth searching out used or as a liquidation special since it seems to have been discontinued and not replaced with an improved model (what is JVC thinking?).",4
"Bought this unit based on reviews listed here--have not been disappointed.  Nice unit, easy to use and of seemingly good quality.  Happy customer!",5
"CD Changers are getting very hard to find at a good price. I really like this JVC changer. It replaces a three or four year old fairly high end Sony changer that started skipping the first 10 seconds of every disc. The changer is connected to a Yamaha RXV-2600 receiver via a fiber optic connector (the same path as the Sony changer). I was very surprised at how much better CD's sound on this player. I'm totaly sold. My guess, you can spend a lot more money, and not be any happier.One downside to this changer, it is tall. But I'll take tall with good sounding solid mechanicals to short and cheap sounding.",5
After having read all the glowing reviews I purchased this item and was not disappointed.  This is a very nice full quality function CD player.  I have been very pleased with this item and its performance.,5
"Many people will tell you that you can't tell one CD player or CD changer from another as far as sound.  Well it seems as though I can and this JVC machine has the best specs in it's price range.  I listen to everything from Rock to Classical and the reproduction of this machine is second to none.  There are more ""advanced"" CD changers that cost two or even three times as much and yet they don't come close to the sound of this CD changer.I guess I am bad talking about the features of this machine.  So I will leave that up to somebody else.  I will say that you can load three CDs at one time which is more than most CD changers.  I just like it for the meat and potatoes of the basics of sound reproduction.EDIT:  Right now I am a man with two stereos.  I know that I should be so lucky.  This JVC is with my OLD ""A"" system.  I have owned this model or the 158 just below it a few times before. My last JVC 258 lasted only 9 months before starting to skip uncontrollably.  I have had durability problems with this model even though as I've said it has the best specs in it's class.  When not owning the JVC I've owned a Harmon Kardon which sounded superior, but costed more, and broke after only 3 months.  I've also owned Sony's both the budget, mid, and high-end models and have various problems from not being satified with the sound to not being able to play copies or MP3's.  Currently my ""B"" system has a Yamaha 697 which has great specs, but is more expensive.  I hope the Yamaha will be more durable.",5
"I have had this unit for a little over a year, using it infrequently. It started having problems playing some tracks on even new CDs, and now it won't play anything.",1
"If you want a multi-CD changer drive/player for your home (separate component) stereo system, this is a good choice.  Mine works flawlessly and has good sound qualities. It closely matches my older (non-JVC) RCVR/AMP unit in size and looks.  It is not portable though and takes up a fair amount of cabinet space but for the money, this is a good deal IMHO.",4
"This is my second JVC CD changer, I gave the first one I purchased five years ago to my mother and it's still working like a champ. This player has  excellent sound and the controls on the front panel and on the remote are  well laid out. The disk exchange feature is nice, you can leave one disk  playing while you swap the others. The only  downside to this player is on  the programming, you cannot add tracks to a program once it is entered,  doing so stops the program and you have to start over again. This is mostly  annoying when you are recording to MD or tape and realize that you have  forgotten a song.",5
"I don't understand all the negative reviews about this changer. I've owned this changer for about 6 months now, and find it more than suitable for casual use.  My previous 5 disc changer was a Kenwood CD-203 (purchased in 1998); I also own a Pioneer 301 disc changer.  Before purchasing this changer, I was quite apprehensive due to the negative reviews on here.  I bit the bullet, as my Kenwood changer was acting up, and I am quite happy with this product.This changer has never skipped on me or presented other issues.  I use the optical output on the changer to connect to my receiver, and the quality is excellent.  The remote works even with sloppy angles.  The changer is quiet when changing CDs (rotating the carousel), and the display is readable from across the room.There are a few little quirks:  The changer differentiates between 'exchanging' a CD (thus not interrupting the currently playing CD, and not opening the drawer all the way) and 'open', which stops the current CD and opens the drawer.  Personally, I find the distinction a little annoying, since I almost always want to 'exchange'.  My previous Kenwood has no such distinction.I also wish the remote layout and buttons were a little more friendly to use by touch and not by sight--I like to listen to music in low light or even darkness, so I had to memorize some of the remote buttons (In particular, 'disc skip' is located in the middle of the remote).However, these are extremely minor nits.  The changer is excellent, feels sturdy, and has survived about 600 hours of use in the last 6 months.  I am delighted with my purchase and would recommend the changer to anyone looking for a low capacity changer.",5
"i am pleased with this cd player, after searching thru best buy and circuit city it was a welcome relief to find a product i really wanted.",5
Sound quality is excellent for the price and it is very easy to use; I highly recommend this player.,5
"I love this changer, it does everything I want it to do. It can do random playing as well as straight forward and continuous play which means I can listen to a variety of music for hours.",5
"I have had this changer for approximately 5 weeks, past the Amazon 30 day return policy, unless stocking charges and shipping costs are paid by me.  JVC will not exchange the unit but will repair it at their local authorized dealer.At first, there were seldom, random skips, garbles, and lyric repeats.  These have become more frequent and annoying.  Pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help.  My ten year old Yamaha changer, it has drawer problems, plays my discs flawlessly.So far, this is the only problem but a major one that is getting worse.  Everything else is working and I do like the unit.  The sound quality is superior to my old Yamaha and the remote is better.I do not know if this unit can be fixed or, like with cars, the repair people cannot duplicate the problem.I am not going to put a lot of time, energy, or gas into getting this changer repaired beyond my first attempt.  Maybe DVD changers are made better and I can use one as a CD player?I am disappointed, to say the least, and from my experience, I know purchasing electronic components can be a gamble.  I hope your purchase goes better.Update: 1/21/09I took the unit in for warranty repair.  They replaced the laser and on the technician's equipment, both analog and optical cable connections were tested, the unit played flawlessly.  On my home system with a new optical cable, I again had the original problems.  I gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection.  It must be a hand shake issue with my equipment so I no longer believe it is the unit itself.  I have read that some electronic equipment combinations do not always work well together.  I conclude that was my situation.",2
"No. I wasn't referring toTJ Wisemen RCFM222 Remote Controlled Fart Machine No. 2I mean, some times a dry cleaner works better than a wet one. Often I'll do a dry one,then follow it up with a wet one likeMaxell VP-200 VHS Wet CleanerI wouldn't recommend a WET one followed by a DRY one... that might bind you all up orsomething. I hate it when my stuff gets all bound up and it requires being opened up bya professional.I hope I have layed/laid... PUT all the options ON the table. Buy these before they gothe way of... of.... VCRs!Thank you!",4
"It seems to work fine, If you're having issues with your VCR playback and recording quality, this is the answer.",4
"My Fiancee and I have many, many, VHS and DVD movies.  Here VHS player started messing up, so we went to store after store looking for a cleaning tape. Finally ordered two cleaning tapes online. both work great.",5
"I have a temperamental DVD player. I ordered this dry head cleaner, because it is so temperamental about what we use in it.",5
Just as advertised. Arrived quickly.  Seems to have fixed the tracking problem on a veryold VCR with many hours use.,5
This is very convenient to use but the wet cleaner works better. Simple to use and can be used multiple times.,3
The tape video head cleaner works as expected. Very good product. I recommend it for those who want to keep their old VHS equipment.,4
Bought 2 of these thinking they'd be be similar to traditional head cleaning tapes that might play for 5 minutes before a rewind is required. These dogs run maybe 30 seconds giving a possible 2 supposed cleanings before rewind. The 'cleaning tape' doesn't appear any different than 'video tape' and any improvement in video playback was mostly imagined. Went back to using a 20 year old cleaning tape.This product is a DOG DOG DOG and stink you'll stir up after stepping in this turd hangs around for weeks.,1
put this tape and just push play and it cleans your vcr.  My tv/vcr combo is an old model that I found free on the road side  which had a fuzzy playback mode and and the voice was almost nonexistent.  After playing the tape twice I now have a crystal clear picture and a normal voice on the  vcr playback!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
I just can't fathom how a dry tape can clean all that well. I also wonder how this can clean the record heads being that it never has you press the record button (probably doesn't clean the record heads is my guess) However it is by far the simplest to use! Even my Mom could do it! That's got to be worth something. I think I'll give it to my Mom!,4
"I'm writing this review at the urging of Amazon.Com, but it's really a bit early. I bought a couple of Maxell VP100 Dry Video Head Cleaners because I planned to copy a lot of old VHS tapes to DVD on my new VCR/DVD recorder.  I've successfully used it about five times total on three VCRs. In the last attempts, when I inserted the cartridge, it immediately started rewinding, and I had to stop it and hit play. It doesn't always play. This has happened on two VCRs. So...the jury's still out on this product.  I think I'm supposed to get about 100 uses.  I'll come back and edit my review if I have any new information.",3
Most of us have old VHS tapes in the closet and the VP-100 keeps your VCR delievering a clean image.What more can I say---it works!,5
This are so useless they dont clean the vcr perfectly and you can clean a vcr yourself for free!!!!!! the only reason you should use this is if you have one of those tv vcr combos those you cannot clean yourself,1
"I have always used wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes since I can remember, but I have found the Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner to work just fine. Generally, if you use a higher grade tape for home recording you are not going to run into problems. In fact playing a high quality tape through your machine will actually clean your tape heads. Most times when problems develop is when you rent tapes or play pre-recorded budget tapes in your VCR. You may notice picture deterioration or even loss of picture, sound and tracking by playing contaminated tapes or tapes of an inferior quality where the oxide gets transferred to your video heads, linear audio heads, rollers and guides. In these instances wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes have always corrected the problem for me, but I have found that this Maxell Dry Head Cleaner corrects those issues just as efficiently and completely. This Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner really does work and you can maintain your unit and fix the problem on your own.I have found that for best performance, it is best to use dry head cleaners as part of a routine maintenance of your VHS player/recorder. This allows you to stop build oxide up before it becomes a major problem. I have not had to use a wet cleaner in over 14 years now.",5
"This product is made in China and runs for ten seconds one cycle at a time with automatic rewind and no sound or video accompanying.  This product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format.  I liked the original product much, much better - not happy. Try to find Maxell SKU: 290058, UPC: 025215290053, to see if it does the job.",2
I use my VCR for high quality audio recordings. This cleaner does a great job of cleaning up the slight noise I get when tape heads start to get dirty. Highly recommended.,5
"Terrible product.  The older version (with the same model number) was excellentAll this one does is jam in the machine.no cleaning video, no cleaningbuzzes for a few seconds and jams.I bought 2, both had exact same problem.",1
"Like several other reviewers, the product ruined the picture.  I read some comments on other negative reviews and can say that there were no other variables at play in my case.  There appears to be very poor quality control on these and buyer beware.  The product I received destroyed the picture and I am hoping another product will be able to fix the VCR.Addendum: Another head cleaner returned the picture except for color distortion in one stripe.",1
I put the tape in and it immediately turned off my vcr and ejected the tape. I tried again and the same thing happened. I tried it in another vcr and the same thing happened. Amazon gave me a full refund.,1
I use both a Wet and Dry VHS head cleaner so this product goes well with the Maxell Wet Head Cleaner.,4
Amazon is sending a replacement.  Unfortunately mine arrived damaged and I had to return it.  They say Dry Tape Head Cleaner's are better than wet.  Maxwell has been in VHS and cassettes for awhile so I imagine it will be worth the investment. I'm hoping to download my video collection on DVD.  So it will get much use!,3
This is an absolutely amazing product. Twice it has made a VCR that is at least 10 years old go from unusable to working like a charm. It has certainly kept us from throwing out our VCR. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to get more life out of their VCR.,5
"This product I'm sure works in some cases but in the case of my VHS cleaning job, it did not work. It did improve the picture but did not completely fix the picture. I gave it 3 stars rather than one star because I don't know if a wet VHS head cleaner would have done the job better and I made a poor selection or if the VHS is failing in a different way.",3
It sort of works.  It worked in one vcr fine.  I didn't seem to work in the other one.  Iffy.,4
It works clean and prefect. What else can be said but get it.,5
"This item arrived on time and in good condition.  I have several VHS players, and this is a must for me.  Very easy to use to get great results without having to open up the VHS unit to clean it, though I still do once in a while just to visually check the bands.  This works as good as the wet type head cleaner, but without the hassle of adding drops into the head cleaner tape.  I recommend this head cleaner.  I give this a 5 star rating because this is the simpliest way to clean the video and audio heads of a VHS.",5
"There is no question that Maxell has made the best of cleaners for your electronics. They have definitely done it for years, with accessories, and continue to do so. While many people have stopped owning VCR's, there are some that still do after all these years, and Maxell is still making those aids for it. This Maxell Dry Tape Head Cleaner handles very well, and works in a instant. It is very easy to read and understand, and should not die down. It will last around 100 times for use in your VCR, and definitely is worth the money. While, it can take a bit out of you if you do overuse it, it should keep you VCR from any flaws for at least 10 years. I have always loved what Maxell had made with their electronics accessories, and this should definitely be a great buy.Price: BConvience & Quality: B+Overall: B 1/2+",4
"I am giving this product a one star review because it did not work for me.  I recently purchased theTerraTec G3 Video Digitizer with Scart Connector, USB 2.0 PC Interface, PAL, NTSC, SECAM Video Standards, for Mac & Windows.to convert all of my old VHS videos to digital format.  This product hooks up to the video OUT of your VCR, interfaces with your computer through USB, and records.  I no longer have my own VCR, so I had to borrow one from a friend.  I wanted to use this cleaner to ensure my friends VCR would be in top shape for the conversion.  Keep in mind that for all intents and purposes, I have not touched a VHS or a VHS player practically since DVDs became popular.  With that said, I popped this cleaner in my VCR in about every way I could think of and could not get it to play.  I tried to play it, rewind it, and fast forward... and then play it again.  The reels would just not spin.  Luckily, the VCR my friend let me borrow was a ridiculously nice unit that was paired with his home theater setup when VHS was still widely used.  It just did not need cleaning.I seem to remember that some VCRs may have been ""self-cleaning.""  I could just be making that up, but perhaps this cleaner will not work with a self cleaning VCR?  Does anyone know anything about this?",1
This is okay.  But I prefer one that has a message that shows it is working. I still like to tape some shows and find it hard to find a cleaner that does have a message instead of just &#34;noise&#34; showing.,4
This is quickly becoming a very hard to get item since vcr's are now few and far between.This item is almost non-existent in stores.It does the job it was made for.You can't ask for anything more.,5
"I've been digitizing a lot of family movies, videos, etc., and it is very important that the VHS player I've been using has clean heads. We manually cleaned the heads when we started, but I purchased this to clean them intermittently during this very long process. The VHS player is running our tapes through very crisp and clear. I believe it's doing what it's supposed to do.",4
This is an excillent head cleaner. There are visual graphics on the tape that talk you through the process & you get a little chart that you can stick on the tape case which shows that you can get 100 uses out of it. Then just toss it out & replace it. This cleaner really improves the A/V quality on a VCR.,5
"I purchased this for a friend and they absolutely loved it.  Based upon that, I strongly support anyone's decision to give this product a try.",4
"Received the head cleaner on time. Worked as expected, although the actual cleaning time was less than 20 seconds, as stated in the instructions.",4
"I've had plenty of experience with VCRs over the years, inside and out. I've had to clean and repair plenty of them and occasionally used dry head cleaners for mild jobs. This thing is a piece of junk and doesn't clean anything. First of all, the box indicates the cleaner should be stopped after running for 20 seconds (always check the instructions for anything regardless of how experienced you are...never let ego or testosterone get in the way, guys...use a little wisdom). The only problem is there isn't 20 seconds worth of cleaner tape on the cassette. It runs for 11 seconds and stops. Second, it's not good when you place one of these (or a tape) into the machine and you hear a loud electronic sounding 'grinding' noise. It happens whenever a tape has wrinkles in it and this thing did exactly that at the beginning each and every time I ran it through (I checked the actual tape and nothing looked out of the ordinary). I gave up after a bit to avoid any further problems. After running it a few times, it still did not do anything with the simplest of cleaning jobs. I can crack open the case and clean the heads by hand faster than this thing.Clearly I'll be looking for an alternative or simply taking care of the problem by hand.Bottom line, useless.",1
I have a panasonic tv with built in VCR.  VCR doesn't work and tapes were getting stuck.  I thought/hoped this would do the trick.  It didn't help.  I will try to use it on my other VCRs.  Maybe they need some help before they go bad too.,3
I have 2 of these and neither one works in the 2 different VCRs I have.  They make the screen worse.  I then use my old style Maxell cleaning tape to fix the picture!  How can I get the old style Maxell VCR cleaner?,1
I have an old VCR that was getting quite dirty and this did the trick at cleaning the heads.  They are getting harder and harder to find but I'm glad I finally found this one to purchase.,5
"Tried this in my Sony, JVC, Magnavox and Panasonic VHS VCR's and it does not work properly on any of them.The cleaner tape stops at various periods of time and never completes a cleaning cycle.  It is intermittent at best.Don't wast your money.",2
"Man oh man,,,I stuck this sucker in  really less than 2 sec's later it was done...so I thought nah nothing is ever going to clean my dirty heads of my old VHS player tv combo..................................but how wrong I was...as I did it again just to be sure...and less than 2 sec's later....done !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...so either dry VHS cleaners are better than the wet type or I and I alone got a magic special cleaner for my tv/vhs combo.............",5
"I put this in my VCR and it turns off the VCR.  I've tried everything.  It runs VCR tapes fine, but when I put the Maxell Head Cleaner cassette in, it turns the VCR off.  Then when I turn the VCR back on, it ejects the tape.",1
Easy to use.  I would recommend this product over other products.  It was cheaper online than it was at the store.,5
"I purchased this for my DVD/VCR converter combo. The product is working just fine. I haven't had an opportunity to use it a lot, but that's a good thing, right?",4
"Never thought I'd be needing one of these again. In fact, what is a VCR?Anyway, my Disney movies were crackly and the screen was fuzzy. Ran this puppy through and they were like new again.",5
"I don't know why these outdoor speakers were so cheap; they replaced much larger speakers that eventually gave it up to the weather conditions, but the sound is even better. They are powered with a standard 50-watt Sonos receiver/amplifier unit, and still sound teriffic.  In fact, I like them so much that I'll probably take them down for the winter, to avoid having to replace them in a few years.",5
"For the cheap cheap price, these speakers work as good as needed and sound decent.  They do what they need to do and did I say they were cheap?!",4
"I bought these to mount under my deck for some outdoor tunes and they work great!  Sure they don't have the deep bass that you might expect from expensive indoor speakers, but at this price they do they job perfectly.  They have already been through several rain storms here in Georgia and continue to work fine.  Highly recommended!",5
THESE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT!  THE HAVE HIGH QUALITY SOUND AND WORKED GREAT FOR MY COMPUTERS EXTERNAL SPEAKERS.  I LOVE THE QUALITY WHEN LISTENING TO MY CD'S,5
"Bought 2 pair for an outdoor screened porch for $30 per pair.  They sound great, were easy to mount, and oh so inexpensive!  We've had some gatherings and the sound has been plenty and when sitting out quiet, it sounds great too.For the porch setup, I also purchased a stereo receiver (Sherwood) for $85.  My main goal was to allow radio play and to use an iPod as source for the screened porch.  Well, the sound is great (nice lows and can even blast all the neighbors), the components were cheap (except the iPod) and I can feel okay leaving the receiver outdoors (out of direct rain path, but definitely gets plenty of dust and humidity.)",5
"We were moving and didn't want to leave the Bose 161 speakers (that I had installed in every room of our home.)  I looked for speakers that were less expensive to leave in their place, and took a chance on these Audio Source LS 200 speakers based upon the reviews here in Amazon.com. Although the reviews were good, one doesn't expect ""real"" quality at this price. You cannot imagine our surprise at the quality of the sound these speakers reproduced! They are not as spacial as the Bose but their dynamic and acoustic range is excellent.  Like the Bose they fall off rapidly below about 80Hz but are very linear up to the audible limits. (If you want more bass add a sub-woofer.)",5
"I bought these speakers for my pool deck (I live in Florida).  I mounted them to my stucco-covered walls using toggle bolts to attach the included brackets.  These little speakers look great, and really have decent bass response considering their size.  [It probably helped they were mounted in corners.]I am greatly disappointed by the rusting of the metal face, though.  They have only been out for about six months and the mesh cover is already rusting.  Outdoor speakers should not have this issue - stainless or galvanized steel should have been used for the mesh and then painted.I would rate these four stars for sound, but only three because of the poor weathering.",3
"I mounted them under my eaves and they work great.  I thought because they were so cheap that the sound would be cheap, but they sound great and have worked fine after a few rain storms.",5
They do a good job. I put them below my deck and they have worked very wellfor two years. Great sound. I would buy them again. Great bargain for the price.,5
"I bought these after reading reviews .I don't think they sound as good as some said they did.However I am satisfied with them for what I use them for ,background music on patio.For the money I didn't expect Bose quality.",4
"dollar for dollar these are hard to beat !! every body was right about the brackets ,they are a little weakly made. mine are mounted inside our camper in the upper corners of the bedroom and sound much better than the old ceiling speakers.will buy another pair for the living area to replace the other pair of ceiling speakers out there. are a nice size for space avaiable.",4
"I've owned a pair of these speakers for several years.  I have been and continued to be amazed at the sound quality these very cheap speakers provide.  They are part of my budget ""home theater"" system in my bedroom, the other components being a 1970's Pioneer receiver, a five year old Pioneer DVD player, and a Samsung 16"" CRT TV.  Theater on a budget!Several years ago, I was taking some very nice used bookshelf speakers  back to a hi-fi store to trade them in on larger speakers.  Just for fun I wired one of these beautiful little wooden speakers to one channel of the Pioneer receiver and one of these Audio Source speakers to the other channel.  Then I moved the balance from left to right and back a few times to see what the difference was in the sound.  I was amazed to find I could not hear a significant difference in the sound!Anyway, I've enjoyed going to sleep to jazz on FM radio, and watching DVDs with the sound coming through these speakers, for several years now.  It makes me wonder if all the hype about expensive speakers and specs in the hi fi world is just a load of...well, you know.",5
"For a cheap pair of outdoor speakers these sound better than the price warrants, and lasted longer than I expected.",4
"Sure these are not the worlds greatest speakers.  Yes the bass is a little low, but you are only paying thirty something dollars.  For the price the speakers are amazing, they have some good volume before they distort and they have better bass than all the leading name brands that run one to two hundred dollars.  I put a pair of Inifinity Outdoors in a side by side comparison and actually had better bass output from the audiosource.  So I took the Inifinity's back and had enough money to buy a 300 disc cd changer and money left over to buy an extra pairs of audiosource speakers for the garage and more on the deck.I would recommond these speakers to anyone who wants good sound quality outside at a cheap price.  If you are looking for surround sound speakers, then look elsewhere.",5
"I put this pair of speakers outside on the right side of my garage facing my backyard....and boy does it produce nice sound.  I placed it up under the roofline so it would stay a little drier.  I live in rainy Houston, we have had 4 or 5 heavy rainstorms and the speakers are still working just fine.  This pair was a great price, arrived very quickly, and sounds just fine.  Buy it and save money.",5
"I bought this model because it was cheaper than the Sparkplug model in white with an L-shaped plug. Well, the straightness of the plug couldn't withstand normal use, and the audio stopped working because the junction between the wire and the hard part of the plug probably got bent back and forth too much. Good sound and sound-blocking, but not durable if you plan to move your MP3 player in and out of your pocket.",1
"Beautifully soft and comfortable, cone-shaped earphones, and the only ones I've ever found that don't keep falling out of my ears like earbuds do. Good sound quality, and excellent price, with the superb Koss reputation behind them.",5
"Great sound for the price. Plus absolutely amazing sound isolation for traveling! For $10 you get something that paying $100 wouldn't compete with.I've traveled with my friend and his high dollar Bose noise canceling headphones and while those are more comfortable (since the don't sit in the ear) the isolation was just as good.Mine wore out after a little over a year, so I mailed them back to Koss since they have a lifetime warranty, and I got a new pair.Can't beat that.Only downside is that wearing them for hours and hours can cause your ear canals to be a little sore.",5
Warranted for lifetime but 9 dollars return EACH (even if shipped multiples) for shipping plus whatever you pay to ship to them to repair facility.  They can be shipped for 3 dollars or less (no matter how many) very easily so Koss is definitely cheating us here.  Used to be 6 dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this 12 dollar for new price.Ear buds themselves are fairly good (usually last me about 2 months) when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good.  They fit well and stay in good too.,2
The headphones look better than older Koss Sparkplug but the sound quality is much worse.,3
"These are awesome.  Best $13 headphones I've ever heard, and they cut out the dull roar of trains/cars/computers/coworkers almost entirely!  I truly wonderful product, and Amazon had them in my hands in 24 hours!  I'm just so, so pleased... :-)",4
"I've compared these ear buds to Shure e2c's, ($50-60), and Creative Zen Auravana's, ($60-100), and found them better than the Shure's and almost as good as the Auravana's in certain ways, and better in other ways, (the bass on the Auravana's is too thumping, and cable noise is worse than the Koss).  They're just plain astounding - especially for the money.  If you want to buy something that beats all three, get the Creative EP-830's.  Incredible sound that just barely beats these little Koss buds - but they're $50.  For the money, the Koss can't be beat, period.",5
"I've owned 2 pairs of these, and they do provide o.k. sound quality for the price.  However, I've since switched to another brand of in-ear headphones (JVC Marshmallow--love 'em) due to several shortcomings of this product:- difficulty in acheiving optimum sound: you gotta have these positioned in your ear perfectly to get well-balanced sound- cheap cord: it's too thin and flimsy, tangles too easily- cranial reverb: every bite you take or word you say ressonates through your skull in an unsettling way when you have these on- sound quality isn't really that great compared to the JVCsThere are better value choices out there; I'd recommend skipping these.",2
"OK, the deal is that I was looking for earbud headphones that I could wear while riding my motorcycle long distance on the highway.  Most earbuds are useless because at high speed the wind noise drowns out everything.  In fact, wind noise is so bad that I normally have to wear earplugs.Enter the Koss earbuds.First, the sound. *Great* sound, very accurate with excellent range. Headphones aren't worth it if the sound does not satisfy.These *more than* satisfy.Second, the applicability to the task.The earplugs supplied with the earbuds are darn good and will work for most applications.  I decided that I wanted something even more custom, so I cut up some of my normal motorcycle-riding foam plugs and fitted them over the earphones.  The result is excellent.  Even at 80 mph I get good sound with comfort and acceptable windnoise reduction.If you want absolute noise isolation plus sound, I recommend you get large-size soft foam earplugs.  Drill out a hollow shaft through the center.  To do this, heat up a 3/32&quot; drill bit, force it through one end and then twist repeatedly to cut out a shaft.  Press the earplugs over the small tube on the earphone, then apply the earplugs according to the instructions on the earplug package.*Purchasing Note*I was suspicious of the Circuit City pickup option, but tried it anyway.  I was *very* pleased.  Circuit City confirmed the purchase within 20 minutes, and I picked up the headphones the same evening.",4
"I tried the Sure e2c's as an attempt to upgrade from my normal Sennheiser MX500's.  The Sures are sturdy, very inconvenient to use, and I couldnt get them to seal properly in my ears no matter how much fidgeting I did.  So I bought the Plug, another MX500, and still saved at least 25 bucks over the Sure productThe Plug sounds terrific for the money.  The sound isolation was good and they were easy to fit to your ear properly and produced a good all around sound revealing sounds absent when I use my Sennheisers.  The bass is more prominent but didnt seem out of balance...it was just easier to hear and a little muddy &lt;what can you expect for 12 bucks?>.  I listen to a lot of rockin blues, and these are perfect because you can hear the typical basslines in a standard blues band group better.Is the Plug better than the Sure which is far more expensive?  For me it is, but only because I could get the Plug to seat properly in my ears and couldnt with the Sure. I think the Sure e2c's would sound awesome if they would fit properly, albeit lots more inconvenient to use.",5
"I wanted to try these because I use my mp3 player in noisy environments, and they were supposed to be able to fit tightly into your ears and block the outside noise.  Well, I never was able to use them and finaly gave up on themn. I tried many times to squeeze the foam and hoped that they would mold to the shape of my ears, but it was never satisfactory.  I found them very uncomfortable.",1
"I kid you not. Decided to splurge (over $300) on a super set of earphones for my ipod from Shure and hated them and sent them back. Then I tried these as a temporary solution and found them actually vastly superior in sound, aesthetics and discrete form. I simply love them. As a frequent traveller, I appreciate not hearing the usual yada yada on the airplane. Highly recommend them.",5
"Got my first pair around 10 years ago, loved them then and still love them now. They fit and seal well, block as much ambient noise as safety ear plugs, and they sound awesome to me. I use them with a sansa clip zip at work 12 hours a day 6 days a week and they are comfortable. They require less volume to be used than some competitors brands(saving battery life) to reach a desired level and will certainly go loud enough to make you deaf if you push them. Using the sansa's equalizer allows me to adjust the levels to fit my music and tastes to a sweet sound. I listen to mostly hard rock, classic rock, country, and some blues and I find that while maybe they aren't audiophile quality they are really good for the price.",5
"Ok the first thing about this review. I have a pair of the 'new' the Plug headphones. They are not the ones pictured here. They have no mute button and are metallic silver and purple in color not blue and yellow.Apprently KOSS got a lot of feedback from the first version, they listened, and made a much better product. The ones I have are just fantastic. Great bass, like the original, but very good mids and lows as well. They work better as isolation headphones then anything I have used before, but apprently people who are audiophiles are not that impressed. Also they have fantastic volume ability. Because they are in your ear canal I can turn my portable equipment up really loud. I don't but its nice if you want to. Music sounds great with these headphones. Frankly best headphones I have ever used, BUT I am using the NEW VERSION not the blue and yellow ones pictured here.OK right now what to do? I would call Amazon and MAKE SURE you are getting the new version. I never used the one they have listed here but almost everywhere I looked on the net, people say the new version is MUCH BETTER...",5
"Upon determining that the Apple-brand ear pods included with my iPod were of inferior quality, I opted to have them replaced ASAP.  I assessed my options while remaining conscious of my budget and planned usage of the product, and decided on the Koss ""The Plug"" (or ""Spark Plug"") ear buds.  My other option was the Shure E2C model, as a friend owns these, and they sound phenominal.  However, since I don't foresee myself using my iPod all that often, I didn't up my budget to accommodate these.These headphones are of the ""ear bud"" style, which basically means that a foam/malleable nub is inserted into the actual canal of your ear (as opposed to ear pods, which snugly rest within the exterior of the canal.)  An important thing to know about ear bud-style headphones is that THEY WILL NOT PERFORM AT THEIR MAXIMUM ABILITY IF NOT PROPERLY INSERTED!  Instructions are clearly printed on the back of the package, and if not followed, you will NOT get the best usage out of your product -- in fact, the sound quality very well may sound terrible.To PROPERLY insert these ear buds, the ENTIRE foam nub must be fully compressed (via pinching and rolling with the fingers) and immediately inserted into the ear canal.  Additionally, your best bet is to gently pull your ear canal open by gripping the top of your ear with your thumb and index finger while inserting.  The ear buds then must be held in place (without shoving them in deeper) for approximately 8-10 seconds, while the foam expands into your ear canal, forming a solid fit.  If incorrectly inserted (i.e. not inserted all the way, not compressing the foam prior to insertion, etc.) highs and lows will sound AWFUL, even if you own a pair of $300 ear buds (yes, they do exist.)  Simply put, if you look in the mirror with the ear buds inserted and you can only see the plastic ear pod outside of your ear, then you can pat yourself on the back for a job well done.With that out of the way, the sound output of these rather inexpensive Koss ear buds is very impressive for the price.  The frequency response ranges from 10 Hz to 20 kHz, which is nothing to smirk at.  Distortion is cleverly kept to a minimum at all volume levels except for the very loudest point (I suggest breaking in your ear buds gently before hopping right in and destroying your ear drums.)  The bass output is subtle and effective for the most part, but doesn't perform very well with certain genres of music (while almost all electronic music sounds amazing, bass-heavy rock music or deep rap music may not produce the same satisfaction.)  It should also be known that there literally is no headphone, in-ear or not, that perfectly reproduces all styles of music, and this applies to even the most expensive models.  Any given headphone device will excel in certain categories of sound reproduction, while performing less impressively in others.  (Can you tell I'm an audiophile yet?)The few negativities to speak of are as follows.  The cable, while a decent length (not too short, not too long,) feels rather fragile.  Additionally, the included foam polymer ear buds are on the large side, and may or may not cause some minor to severe  discomfort after extended periods of use (upwards of an hour.)  Thankfully, replacement ear buds can be purchased in multiple sizes at most electronics stores.Overall, if you're finding yourself in the same boat I was and are looking for a suitable replacement for your disappointing Apple-brand iPod ear pods but don't want to break the bank, the Koss ""The Plug"" are HIGHLY recommended for the price.  I haven't heard any other in-ear ear buds in this price range, but I can imagine that these are hard to beat for the money.Just DON'T FORGET TO PROPERLY INSERT THEM EVERY TIME!  Once you get the hang of it, they can be properly inserted and snug in your ears within 15 seconds.  If you don't insert them correctly, they WILL NOT SOUND GOOD AT ALL, and you will have WASTED YOUR MONEY!  I'm a smoker, and even I hate wasting money!  So, educate yourself on in-ear headphones before buying any, and you won't be disappointed.",4
these plugs easily fall out regardless of what one of the three foam pieces you use. They are uncomfortable and hard to insert even if you follow the directions and suggestions here. I recommend the sony in earphones about $25,1
Very comfortable. great tone and bass sounds. sound isolations is great!!!they are very affordable and i definitely recommend these for anyone who is looking for a great buy.,5
"These weren't as good as I'd hoped. When I put them in, it made my music too loud, the least thing they fell out, generally they did not work for me.",2
"i found them uncomfortable for long use.  i took the spongy parts off the ends and cut the tips off some other earplugs i have so the sound could travel through and that works well, only because it keeps the purple/silver part away from my ear cartillage.  that part is rather large and they won't go far enough into my ear to stay there comfortably.  they'll work but my search isn't over.",3
"This time I bought a new pair because my cat decided to play with the old pair. (These are not cat toys but how do you convey that to a cat that doesn't listen anyway?) The pair I bought before these was for a family member who still loves them and has given a pair as a gift to a few friends.When inserted correctly, these are better than the $200+ Bose noise cancelling headphone and MUCH cheaper. The sound quality is outstanding and the cable is durable... except when a cat plays with it. I do suggest you purchase the ear bud replacements as well since these can get a bit funky after being used for a while. Also, make sure you purchase the correct ear buds. I learned the hard way that Koss makes different buds for their headphones.",5
"At this price point, you're not going to find a better pair of reasonably durable earbuds with this quality of sound or noise-canceling ability. I'd say that I've gone through a pair every few years, and I'll continue to buy these as needed. They block some sound, the sound quality is fine, and you won't be devastated when you realize that you've forgotten them on the plane and need to buy a new pair.",5
"I have two challenges which have made finding proper fitting ear buds problematic.  First, my ear canals are a bit on the small side.  (This issue does not transcend my ear canals but, I digress)  Second(ly), I'm missing that little flap of skin that other people have on their (misshapen) ears that holds ear buds in place.  Despite these challenges, these things stay in place, are quite comfortable, and sound good in the bargain.If you're interested, there is also a wealth of information on the Internets that explains how to modify these things to make them sound and fit even better.  For now, I'm plenty happy with what I got for my $12.",5
"I have tried almost every kind of headphone and somehow could never get ones to a. stay in my ears, b. not hurt my ears, c. keep the quality of sound from my ipod. I purchased these headphones for myself to use at the gym so I can keep them in my ears and the plastic won't hurt me after a bit of use (like most do) and my husband took them and fell in love with them.  He used them all the time and had them with him camping and sadly lost them in his camp fire so we purchased each of us a pair the second time.",4
"I like to tune everything else out and just hear my music when I listen to my music. These work perfectly. The fit will be different for different ears, I actually turn the foam around to stick the bigger side in first. Once they seal, I get deep bass, clear music, and isolation from outside noise, so I don't have to listen to them as loud to get that ""my own world"" feeling.Only drawback, they do wear out. I've gone through 3 sets in about 4 years, first set the foam wore out, replaced just the foam then the foam piece would keep falling out. Second set, same thing. The third set is the only one that actually broke. I use them to work out, and one of the cables started to go, the one side would turn on and off depending on how you moved the cable.For the price, if they only last a year, it's still worth it. Sound quality is great, Isolation is great, and I've returned $100 set's that promised ""Amazing deep bass"" that didn't even compare to the base I get with these.",5
The plugs feel like safety plugs and remove almost as much noise.When  I put these on I was able to reduce my volume level in half!I am now able to listen to my mp3 player while mowing the lawn.But the feel took a while to get used to.  Soft and spongy in my ear didn't feel right at first.Great value for the price.,5
I've been using these buds for around a year now and have really enjoyed them.  They greatly reduce ambient noise and decrease conversational noise immensely.  I especially recommend these buds to those travelling in carpools or public transportation!,5
They do a nice job of isolating...they block out tons of noise. They can be a tad noisy when you chew...,4
"Overall I'm very pleased with The Plug headphones and I've been using them daily for over a month now.I purchased these headphones to replace the stock IPod headphones.  I use my IPod almost exclusively for listening to podcasts while I do my morning walk and while I'm driving to and from work.  For that reason I didn't need high fidelity.What I was looking for was 1)a headphone that would block external noise and 2)stay in my ear 3)comfortably.  4)Good sound was important to me, but I'm not that picky since I don't listen to a lot of music.  Here's how ""The Plug"" fulfilled my criteria:1. Noise cancelling: 5 stars. If you take the time to compress the foam by rolling the foam between your fingers and get it inserted correctly you get almost no external noise.  It acts almost like a regular ear plug.2. Stay in my ear: 5 stars.  Again if you compress the foam and let it expand in the ear canal.  If you don't it still stays in well, but not nearly as well as it does when it is compressed and allowed to expand.3. Comfort: 4 and a half stars.  The half-star deduction is because the hard plastic part of The Plug presses against a spot on my ear and causes just a little bit of a pressure point.  Everybody's ear is shaped different so your mileage may vary.4. I did try these with music and they do sound great.  I've never had an expensive headphone so I can't give a comparison there.I really liked everything about the stock IPod headphones for my use except the ear bud itself.  The foam covers kept coming off and they didn't stay in my ear very well during my walk.  The Plug headphone does remedy those problems.I'm knocking off another half-star because The Plug headphones have a thin cord that gets tangled much easier than the Apple headphones.  This is probably common to any other ""aftermarket"" headphones though.",4
"I purchased these portable headphones based on information in a review by an Amazon customer.  They are great.  I replaced the earphones I received with my Zen Nano and I am so pleased. These are really superior to what came with my Zen Nano. They block out most of the outside sound and my CD recordings sound super.Since I go to the gym every day, I love the fact that these ""stay put"" and allow me to do my daily routine.  They can pretty much be molded by squeezing the eartips themselves and letting them expand when you put them in your ear.I would absolutely buy another set of Koss Plugs.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>UPDATE-January 2009-These portable headphones are still going strong and I use them 5 days a week at the gym.  I am so pleased, that when the time comes, I will definitely purchase Koss again.",5
"Works fine as a basic set of earphones. However, the one-size-fits-all foam earplug doesn't quite fit right and pops out quite easily. Instead, move on and look for a set with rubber ""caps"" that they often ship with 2-3 different sizes - these fit better, stay put without fatiguing the ear.",2
"If you want to go jogging or work out while listening to music, these headphones will stick in your ears like an earplug, staying put until you explicitly try to remove them. Since they block out sound well and stick close to your eardrum, they can produce very powerful and clear sound despite their size. They hide pretty well. Their foam piece is cheap online and easy to replace, which is important because they will wear out with all the squishing to make them fit in your ears. Best of all, they are cheap.Please keep in mind, though, that they pretty much function as earplugs. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. If you go jogging and fail to look both ways at roads, you may not notice a car approaching. However, if you want to be alone with your music and your thoughts (such as if you are ADD) then will serve you well.",5
"I found these to be a waste of money and time. They didn't stay in my ears, I have very small ears, no matter how I tried I could not get them to fit properly, even the smallest cushion caused discomfort. The only thing they have going for them is that they are cute.",2
I had a older version of this headphone that had the angle plug on it.And they lasted for 3 years. These new ones have a straight plug and lasted only 2 weeks before i had to replace them. If they go back to the angle plug i will buy these again. If you look at the photo you see the angle plug they changed it to a straight plug.,1
"No matter what sale or deal there is or how cheap it is, do not buy these earphones.I've purchased $8 headphones that were 1000 times better.I would not want these for free. Sound quality is crap.They're comfortable but that really doesn't matter if the sound is horrible.",1
"Sound is good from these cans, though not excellent.  They do a fair job isolating outside noise, though quickly over time the foam stiffens on the earpieces.  The audio quality is basically what I'd expect at this price point, so no real complaint there.But the cables are terrible. Stiff and they transfer the noise of everything they touch.  Any slight movement that rubs against the wires translates that sound into your ears.  If you want to sit perfectly still, that's not a problem.  But terrible for the gym or most any other part of life that includes movement on your part.",3
"These earphones sound quite good for the price. However, after owning two pairs over the last couple years & experimenting with them in every way I can think of, I cannot get them to stay inside my ears. You would need to have a very large ear canal to keep them secure & not popping out. Koss gives you different size covers, but all of them do the same thing; within a minute or two, these always pop out. The cord is also unnecessarily long. It is a shame, because  they do sound quite good, and when they are in securely, they isolate noise around you, making it possible to hear a great deal of detail in music. I recommend you spend a bit more money & buy the Shure E2c earhones, which give you a number of ear canal fittings, and which sound VERY MUCH better.",2
"Apparently I have non-standard ears. Normal buds will fall out easily. So I focused my research on in-the-ear buds that would hopefully stay in my ears without constant adjusting. Onto the pros/cons:PROS* Block outside sounds out well. You can stick them in your ears a little for a little sound blocking, or really roll up the foam and deeply embed them into your ears for near silence.* The sound blocking really lends to the quality of the sound output since you hear more of the music and less of whatever else is going on around you.* Produces a lot more sound output at the same volume. I attribute this to cancelling outside noise and channeling all the output right into your ears. Does this benefit battery life since you're running reduced volume? I'd think so, but probably not a noticable amount.* Nice long cord.* Seemingly good quality.* Includes extra foamies.CONS:* You have to sick them INTO your ear. Some people probably would hate this.* They can block virtually all outside noise. Someone could be axe murdering my family while I listen to music with these things and I'd never hear it. Seriously.* If the cord gets tugged on or pulled it can transmit ""noise"" to your ears due to the fact the plugs are IN your ear. This is minor but annoying and it happens to me somewhat frequently since I primarly use this with my Shuffle in the gym.* I find the bass to be muddy. However, this is the case with every earbud I've used. Consider the price of these it's a very minor complaint.",4
"I've tried a lot of ear-bud style headphones and have found these to be the most comfortable.  A great value.  Sound quality is good, and the design of the ""plugs"" helps filter out noise.  I found these to be great on an airplane, allowing me to relax to my music, while filtering out engine noise, conversations, etc...  Highly recommended...UPDATE: I still agree with everything I wrote in my original review, but I've gone through few of these now.  After 4-6 months, one of the ear buds goes dead or becomes intermittent.  The wire seems to be worn or fatigued over time due to use, It's a cheap item, so maybe the price is still worth it... but just know that it may not be a very durable pair of earbuds...",4
"Excellent price for a non audiophile. For me, sound is great and isolation is too. Nice snug fit. They tend to wiggle a but lose when I run so I use a headband to help hold them in. This works because they are so small and the headband doesn't make it feel like a vise.",4
"These headphones work well and if used properly by gently rolling the foam then immediately inserting into ear, these will stay put and act similar to an ear plug allowing you to hear your music at a low volume level since they block outside noise.",5
They are very comfortable and fit nicely and securely in the ear canal. This fit is better than silicon earbuds. The sound quality I'd much better than any earbud in this price range.,5
"I use these with my ipod nano while at the gym or doing yardwork.  The closed-in ear piece helps keep out the sound of the lawn mower or chatty gym-rats on their cell phones.  These also have the deepest bass of any other earbuds I've tried -- too much for some, but those that like rock or metal should dig 'em.A couple things to note:  A brand new set might have a few issues with falling out, but once the cushions are ""broken in"" they stay in the ear with no problems.  Also, the cushions occasionally soak up sweat and become soft and pinched in the ear.  Lastly, they are almost alway gross after use!It takes a while to get used to the pressure in the ear, but I can't switch after getting used to these.",4
"The only fault I could find with these is that the cord is too short.  Other than that, they're great.",4
"Sure these headphones have memory foam eat plugs, but the back of the earphone has 6 holes in it allowing sound to pour right  in anyway! This completely nullifies any sound isolation gained by the earplug style ear buds! It provided absolutely no noise cancelation on my plane ride.  I had to hold my fingers over the 6 holes to block out the engine noise pouring in through the back of the ear bud.The next problem is in construction. I am a tall guy.  The little eat buds are too small for my ears, so I use the larger plugs included.  They are too long and the plastic tube they fit over is too short.  The foam extends well past the plastic support tube, allowing the tip of the earbud to be squished closed as it sits in your ear. As a result, sometimes you hear nothing.Finally, the plastic fitting of the ear bud, where the foam meats the housing of the ear bud, has a rough edge on it.  I found it scratching my ear and it eventually caused a small sore, after the 15 hour flight I was on...Other than that, the speakers provide fairly good sound.  If it weren't for all the other problems, I'd say these were good ear buds.  But, because of the several flaws, I wish it didn't cost so much to ship these back and get a refund.  As far as I am concerned, I wasted $10 on these...",1
"Just Super Sound coming form this small device. I use it when I travel on the airplane and discovered I don't need the bulky expensive noise canceling headphones. With the ear plugs nicely placed, all you hear is great sound, and its easy to carry around. Definitely recommend it.",4
"Good deal for the $.  The foam earplugs fit much nicer, especially if you have big old ear holes, like I do.This is my 3rd pair and I've liked all of them",4
"These are probably the best units in the $12 range.  The sound is pretty decent for the price IF IF you get them inserted and postioned correctly.  If they are slightly out of perfect insertion (easy to do), either bass or highs will suffer.  With that said, I really encourage you to wait until you can save up for something better.  As I said, it is a hassle to get a good insertion/fit with these (the pinch/roll/wait for expansion thing is not quick).  Once you do, you don't want to move around because they will shift and/or fall out very easily in my experience. This last point is a deal killer for me.  Save up $20 more and go with the Sony EX81L if you are on a budget or look at the Shure line if you have money to burn.",2
"I was looking for something to replace the headphones that came with my iPod since they're EXTREMELY uncomfortable but I do like the sound quality. I've been through about 3 different kinds. Some I've passed off due to comfort and some due to bad sound quality. These ear buds are like putting the small foamy ear plugs in your ears. I've always found them pretty comfortable and these headphones are the same. The sound quality is very different than the iPod ear buds and FULL OF BASS. They also certainly block out a lot of background noise. Like I said, they're like putting in the foamy earplugs. I highly recommend these headphones, especially like the price.",5
"My old headphones stopped working on a 6-hour flight from NYC to LA.  Though my headphones were already not the best (blah set that came with my MP3 player), I hadn't had the inclination/energy to buy another pair until I was desperate.  In other words, I was too lazy.  Well, I was now headphone-less and desperate, so it was time to spring for a new one.I tend to like the ""in ear"" headphones because of the sound quality that comes through in loud environments (loud cities, subway, airplanes, road noise).  I bought the Koss ""Plug"" with hopes that the earplug-like earbuds would fit perfectly into my ears. I have normal-sized ears and don't usually have problems with store-bought earplugs for bedtime.  However, no matter how much I played around with the foam plugs on the Koss set, after 5-10 minutes of fantastic sound (yes, the sound IS amazing!), the plugs would just voluntarily fall out of my ears, for no apparent reason.  I tried squeezing, pinching, twisting, pushing, pulling, and even switching various plug sizes, etc...but with no luck.  And even though I'm feeling the burden of returning to the store (Circuit City--Amazon's price is cheaper), my Koss Plug is going back.  I don't want to super-glue the plugs into my ear to listen to music.  That's not the idea here.But, take note: the bass and general sound of ""the plug"" IS fantastic.  If it fits your ears (lucky thing, you), stick with this one for the sound and the cost.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.  It will only add to your pile of ""things I may use one day"" and we all have too much of that stuff, don't we?",3
"First, while I'm no audiophile and won't attempt to offer comments about the smooth, deep bass or crisp highs...your results may vary...I will say that I'm personally very pleased with the sound from these earbuds and find the isolation they offer is a real plus.  In fact, that's partly why I bought them:  Working sometimes in a very noisy environment that necessitates wearing hearing protectors, I thought it would be nice if I could turn them into headphones and at least enjoy some music while working.  I've never cared for earbuds that rest in your outer ear, so prone to falling out.  With the hearing protectors on over them, it was still rather easy to tug the earbug out of position.  &quot;The Plug&quot; stays quite well put, thanks to the soft foam cushions.  Away from work, the noise isolation of these stereophones continues to serve a great function, especially when travelling on airplanes or in any noisy environment.It is the isolation offered by the ear cushions that surely attribute to their efficiency.  Even low-powered headphone outputs on portable music players will likely still have all it needs to drive these plugs sufficiently for enjoyable listening.  The drawback of the ear cushions is, as others have said, that they do mean you must be careful about how you position the plugs in your ears, as that will affect overall sound quality.  The bass is excellent yet can become &quot;boomy&quot;.  That is why I say &quot;your results may vary&quot;.  But, for anyone willing to spend some time getting familiar with &quot;The Plug&quot;, I think they will be happy with the sound potential provided.Now...about the custom fit.  Yes, they really do custom fit to your ear canal if you choose the appropriate size cushions from those included.  However, again as mentioned, the provided cushions do not remain compressed very well while attempting to insert the plugs in your ears.  Moreover, while the foam does seem to be the best I've experimented with in terms of comfort against the skin and general acoustic performance, it doesn't hold up very well over time.  So, this led me to exploring for a substitute, and learning in the process what a difference in sound the type of foam makes.As I write this, I'm wearing my plugs, modified by replacing the Koss foam cushions with some I made myself from Aearo E-A-R Classic foam ear plugs.  The beauty of this approach is that as the ear plugs are designed for hearing protection, they do compress very well and hold their compressed shape longer, making it easier to insert the plugs into your ear canal, for a better and deeper fit.  But, therein lies the rub...it is that more deep, secure fit that affect sound quality.  My observation is that the impact is primarily upon the bass...making it even deeper and risking again a potential &quot;boomy&quot; quality.  I'm pleased with the results I obtained from the Aearo ear plugs after trimming them down in diameter so there wasn't quite so much foam to &quot;bulk up&quot; in my ear.  While the Aearo plugs work well and sound good, I've found an even more comfortable and better-sounding (I think) alternative in using Howard Leight Laser Lite foam ear plugs.  The latter have a Noise Reduction Rating of 32 and are made of a softer, smoother-textured foam than the Aearos.  I think the Aearos have a similar NRR, but they are not labeled with it.Now, how do you go about making your own ear cushion?  The approach I took was to compress one end of the foam ear plug down until it was basically flattened squarely against the other end on a flat surface.  Then, holding the &quot;pancaked&quot; plug in place, I heated a large nail over a flame and then pierced the center of the ear plug with the tip of the nail, pushing it gently through the foam so as not to tear the foam.  Rotating the nail tended to help.  Once the hole was pierced through the foam to the other end, I lifted the foam off the surface and pushed the nail fully through, this also serving to tug the foam along enough that it helped it to stretch back out along the nail shaft.  Once the nail cooled a bit, I slid the plug off the nail and had a rather cleanly pierced ear plug that I could then slip onto &quot;The Plug&quot;.  If the new ear cushion was too long or too thick to fit my ear well, I'd trim it down gradually with sharp scissors.  In the end, I made up several pairs of cushions to interchange as I like.  The Aearo plugs were rather easy to modify since the foam is stiffer and thus easier to pierce with the hot nail.  But, with care, the Laser Lite plugs could also be pierced without tearing the foam and they are smaller in diameter such that I found no need to trim them, except in length.  When the modified plugs are slipped over the sound delivery tube of &quot;The Plug&quot; earpieces, ensure the tube does not get crimped and extends fully through the cushion so as to deliver the best quality sound.This may sound like a lot of work for such inexpensive headphones, but they are great-sounding headphones for a small price and can be customized to your own liking with a similar approach to what I describe.When I'm not using &quot;The Plug&quot;, I switch to my Koss KTXPRO1 Titanium headphones...another pair of excellent headphones that I don't think can be beat for the price.  They too sound great and have very good efficiency, at about the same price as &quot;The Plug&quot;.  They are better-suited for an office environment where you need an open-air type earpiece to hear conversation through, rather than being isolated.  The volume control on the cord is also a real convenience and is the only thing I find missing from &quot;The Plug&quot;.",4
"These headphones are the best idea I've seen in QUALITY sound for several years!First the foam is similar to those &#34;in-ear&#34; safety earplugs- you simply roll the foam between two finger and insert the headphones into the ear. The foam them re-expands blocking out sounds and noise letting you hear your music, books, etc. much cleaner. The foam on these In-Ear-Headphones is easily replaceable and come with a replacement set.KOSS has been known for years for their quality sounds equipment and these headphone/ear-bud's are no exception. The sound quality of these was 100% BETTER than my BOSE ear-bud headphones and the noise blocking was unsurpassed with these KOSS &#34;The Plug&#34; headphones. They have even replaced my $249.00 headphones with their quality and great sound experience.A word of caution however, they do block sounds around you, so make sure not to wear them if you need to hear anything else around you. Then again you might want too especially when those around you are boring and annoying!",5
"You will read reviews of this product talking about how quickly the foam plugs bounce back, and that you can't get them in your ears fast enough...Koss obviously made great improvements to the foam. THE FOAM IS NOW SLOW RECOVERY, meaning you can get it into your ear. This alleviates the only real downside to the product.",5
"I gave these 5 stars because the price of $6 !! They are somewhat heavy on the bass side but thats ok with me since its not overkill and you can always adjust the bass with an EQ. I did not read any of the reviews before buying them as they were cheap enough, but now im amazed at how good they sound. I wont tell you these are great, just letting you know they are a good to try. I also liked the KSC75's which for a few $$ more are another great buy and sound better but are clip-on (over ear) style.",5
"I kept seeing these on the rack in my local supermarket for $15 and finally gave in and bought them. I hate wearing full-size headphones, as I wear glasses and the ear pads always jam the arms of my glasses into the sides of my skull and hurt me after a short while. These Koss buds are very comfortable.I also travel on airplanes quite a bit and don't want to fork out the big bucks for hissy noise-cancellation so this seemed like a good compromise. These plugs seal out external noise quite well.They are also reasonably efficient, and have STACKS of bass - sometimes I have to use the EQ on my MP3 player to knock the bass down a bit. The top end is a little bit messy (cymbals don't sound that clear), but the overall performance is very good; considering the price.Very lightweight. Cable is very thin.They came with a set of about 5 replacement sponge ear plugs.No built-in volume control.",4
"I've owned Sennheiser, Sony and other headphones, and these are by far the best of the lot. I've used my pair for five months, and they have held up well to the rigors of daily use. Factor in the price, and you can't go wrong.",5
"Note: I received a a black model. Also, they are ported (holes on the outside of the housing to allow pressure transfer, but which don't seem to diminish noise isolation.Pro: The noise isolation with these is great: The eartips are the squishy foam, just like Hearos and other earplugs.  The result is a really good seal with your ear canal.  When riding the bus or walking around, I am able to turn my iPod down from 50-70% volume to around 10-20%. It's a huge difference.Con: The cord is composed of a spongy, grippy rubber. It's the perfect material to use on those dashboard grips you see advertised, where you put something on it (like a cell-phone) and it stays put. However, for a cord it's annoying, as it prevents you from wrapping it, and it just feels stiff and icky. The cord also transfers a lot of vibration noise to your ears when you are in motion. Maybe this is normal for all ear-canal headphones? I don't have enough experience with them. It's my guess that a less stiff, springy material might have been better.Solution: run the cord for one ear over the back of your neck (if your neck is small enough) as it will reduce the pull on your ears.",3
"I have many headphones, many of the head band variety and some of the conventional earbud variety. This is my first purchase of the in the ear type. I never expected the fit to be as comforatble as I found it to be, and did not expect the sound to be as good as it is. I think that Koss is aiming for high volume sales at a very low price for such an excellent product. On top of it all they offer a lifetime guarantee. How can you beat this bargain?",5
"I just received the plug and gave it a try on my Nano.  I bought the Plug in order to replace the Ipod set which bugs me while running on the treadmill at my local gym. Needless to say I have given up my efforts to get some decent sound out of them.  I shoved them as far as I could up my ear canal, up to the point of pain.  Sound was mediocre at best compared to the ""Stock"" earphones that came with the Ipod.  It is of great mystery to me why some of the reviewers gave them such high ratings.  Standard Ipod sets are way better.On the other hand I did not expect anything great due to the price.  You mostly get what you pay for!  Now I'm waiting for my Etymotic ER-6i Isolator head set which should (hopefully) be of better comfort and sound quality.My advice is to spend a few more dollars in order to get a good set.",1
"Bought these for me to try since my ""tecki"" son asked for these for himself. I've got little ears and find these extremely uncomfortable.  I shoot shotguns, so I know how to use foam ear plugs but these are just too big for me.  I'll probably give them to my husband who has big old ears. Most other ear buds I've bought include three sizes of ear cushions, these have only two....big and bigger. The sound quality is heavy on bass with no treble.  I don't know squat about ohms and hz or other sound lingo but I do know what I like to hear in my music and these just don't cut it for me.  I usually don't pay more than $20 for ear buds because the right ear sound always quits after awhile.  Even the Bose had this problem after 18 months.  These looks like they are well made and I do like the fact that there's a flex joint at both the ear buds and the plug-in.",3
"These are OK earbuds as far as sound quality but not better than ones that came with my Zen-M. They are more durable than orgionals and stay in the ear better but they seem to take more volume to hear well and I find the sound quality on the Koss ""Spark Plugs"" much better.",3
"The first time I bought The Plug, I thought the sound was tiny and weak, and I immediately returned it.  Then I saw someone mentioned the purple v.s. blue (earlier version), and I purchased it again, making sure it was purple.  Sure enough, the purple ones are great!  Like other Koss headphones, you not only hear the bass, but you also feel it.  It's amazing that such big bass can come out of these tiny earplugs.  I replaced the included foam plugs with regular plugs from a drugstore and they make an even better seal.I also have the Etymotic ER6i, which costs at least 7 times more than this one.  When it comes to sound, of course the ER6i have a much higher fidelity (but much less bass), but considering the price difference, I think these Koss earplugs have a greater value.  Overall, the sound quality is just average, but if you mostly listen to pop while on the road, you probably won't mind or care that some notes are a little imbalanced and muddy.  As far as sound isolation go, after replacing the included foam plugs with the ones from the drugstore, they are as good as the etymotics.Be sure to get the purple ones!",4
"Koss ""The Plug"", for only $13, is a terrific way to try the ear-canal type of headphone.  They are very comfortable to wear for long periods, have terrific bass, good sound and are comfortable to wear when in bed.  One's opinion of headphone sound is very subjective and comparison is limited because you cannot instantly change from one phone to another. One reason that there are endless opinions of headphone sound.The Plug has foam inserts that expand too fast making it almost impossible to get it into the ear before it expands.  If you do not get a good air seal, there will be little or no bass.The fix is to buy a set of  foam ear plugs (Walmart $1.47 for 12).  Squeeze it flat, use a scissor for cut proper length, re-squeeze under water, let it expand full size, freeze it and then drill the hole to replace the existing foam insert.  You will end up with an ear plug that really works and is very comfortable to wear. You probably will be so happy with ""The Plug"" that you won't have to upgrade to the $300 models!",5
"I own a number of different Koss, Sennheiser, Sony and Grado products and I am extremely pleased with them all.  (I truly believe Grado is the best of the four companies but they don't make an In-Ear product.)These ""Plugs"" are good for nothing in my opinion unless one wants to go deaf, get a blistering headache and have ringing in the ears.  The distortion can only be described as a ""sonic bass mudslide"" that overwhelms and perverts all sounds coming through these ""Plugs.""  I am genuinely shocked that Koss would put their name to such a terrible product; perhaps these ""Plugs"" are designed for a younger generation that wants to be deaf by 25 while listening to the type of ""boom boom"" bass that rattles windows?  But these ""Plugs"" are the exact opposite of what an audiophile or anyone else who wants to just ""listen"" and ""hear"" his/her music, books, etc. through headphones.  Before the blistering eight hour headache these ""Plugs"" had given me was through, they were repackaged and shipment was arranged for a refund.  I've never been disgusted by a Koss product before but I feel that I write out my experience as a warning to others.  Audiophiles and music lovers, BEWARE!In terms of In-Ear headphones, I would recommend the updated version of ""The Plug"" known as ""The Spark Plug.""  It doesn't have as long of a cord but they haven't set my teeth on edge or caused headaches such as the one I received from ""The Plug"" and they do offer some passive noise reduction.  I also recommend the Sennheiser In-Ear headphones.  They are more expensive (in the 60-80 dollar range) but worth it if you have the money because Sennheiser does make a better product in my opinion than Koss these days.  The truth is that Sennheiser surpasses Koss on almost everything these days.If you don't like In-Ear headphones (and I'm not much of a fan of them myself with a few exceptions) and don't want to spend more than $[...], the Koss PortaPro, Sennheiser PX-100, PX-200 (awesome and blocks sound!), the iGrado, Grado SR60 (the best for pure sound!), Sony MDR-Q22LP (great little set!) and Koss KTXPRO1 are excellent alternatives that I believe are truly worth five to ten times what they cost.  I hope this was of some help.",1
"The original foam cusion is not very comfortable. There is an excellent article on[...] which describe a simple mod to make it an excellent sound isolating in-ear monitor. Based on your listening preference, you may decrease the bass or mid level damping. The mod will make it a poor man's Shure.",5
I own 3 pairs of these now and am totally satisfied with them.  I have probably about 25 sets of ear buds and headphones for a variety of purposes.  Not any single set serves one purpose but for the purposes I use these for (casual listening while sitting or walking and noise isolation) these are perfect. They're the only device I'll use to listen to music through my smart phone or laptop.  I love the way they seal of the sounds from the outside world as the foam stem covers slowly expand in your ears.,5
The horrible ear buds that came with my pricey MP3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place.  I could wear these little Koss plugs all day long and never know they're there.  And sound quality is perfect.,5
"These work for some people's ears and not for others. One reviewer claimed that I must be either retarded or deformed since they don't work for me. That reviewer is best described by words not allowed in this venue.I'm going to replace the useless foam, others have suggested:for hunters: Silencio Super Sound Baffler earplugsfrom a pharmacy: Flents &quot;Quiet Please&quot;I believe you have to create the center hole in these products to retrofit them to the Koss' &quot;stem&quot;.- Jeff",1
"After a month of use, I am quite satisfied with my purchase.  The foam inserts are far more comfortable than any other style I have worn.  The sound quality exceeds standard headsets that generally come with MP3 players and Walkman stereos.  They are not audiophile caliber, but considering the price, they sound fine.  I wear them while running and they're sweatproof, so far -- and unaffected by any ""stethoscope"" effect that other reviewers have noted about Sony earphones.  I can also adjust how deep I place the plug in my ear canal, enabling me to hear the environmental sounds (sirens,horns,etc.)that affect my saftey, when running in public places.It's too early to comment on durability, but I do treat them carefully, as I would any lightweight/portable headphones.An excellent buy at under $15.00",4
"Good sound isolation, too much bass for realistic sound, might be ok if you only listen to disco...very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes.",1
"this product is a great value. when coupled with the (2 Pair, Trilevel - Earphones Plus brand replacement ear cushions made to fit Klipsch, Shure, Etymotic and other models requiring a 2mm attachment diameter. Clear, Large) it makes these ear buds on par with higher cost phones.",4
"Don't expect these to last for more than 3-5 months before one of the sides stop working.  Used them for ~1 hr a day 5 days a week for exercising, and they broke after 3 months.  Very poorly made, and $9 for a warranty replacement.",2
"I always liked Koss Headphones. The price and the Sound. Some reviews say that it is bass heavy. If you have an EQ mode on your Mp3 Player then try that to adjust the sound to your liking. Ipods and Zunes players have good EQ Settings. Love the ear cushions. They fit really good. Would recommend these headphones especially for the priceNote:To get the Cushions to fit in properly. try this, lightly squeeze the foam then insert in to your ear and hold for about 5 sec. it should form inside the ear and you not have a problem of them slipping out.",5
"I find these ear buds to be very comfortable, decent at sealing out surrounding noise and have decent sound.  One downside is that because the sound comes through a plastic straw-like tube, if you're opening your mouth (i.e. eating, yawning) the tube will pinch and the sound will become muffled, but this is only temporary.",4
I have bought these before and had the left ear plug go out after 5 months. Koss has a lifetime replacement guarantee so i returned them and after 7 months with my new ones the same thing happened. For the price its not bad but be warned you get what you pay for.,2
"I can confirm that this model here does NOT have the volume control in-line, thankfully.Edit:After owning these for several months, I put a pair through the wash.  They still worked but the foam died.  I bought another pair, and have concluded these are overall the best buds for the price.Edit #2:After ordering a second pair and using them for a bit, they too have given way and the expansive response of the foam no longer prevails amidst the sweat, etc.  Therefore I am off to buy my 3rd set.  For such a low price, I really could care less.",4
"Now these are not balanced to start with, more boost in the muddy area (200hz-300hz). But with a little cut in this area they are sooooo good. They rival even my Sony MDR-7509HDs when this cut is applied. I also have an communications headset from Koss, SB-49 for $50, which I've used for gaming AND mixing audio. Koss just makes great sounding gear, but pay for the high end stuff to get out-of-the-box balanced.",5
Great sound while they worked.  One earpiece just quit working all of a sudden.,2
"I'm giving a 4 star review for these earphones with a couple big caveats.  I've owned a lot of portable headphones throughout the years and most recently have used a set of Koss SportaPros that have served me well; they sound good (not as good as the PortaPros, but still good) and were pretty cheap.  But they leak sound terribly, meaning they're not a great choice for listening on a crowded subway or while at work, and also are not that convenient to carry around.  When I recently bought an iPod and finally got to try out some in-ear headphones, I loved the convenience of being able to stuff both my player and the phones into one pocket when not in use, but I never could get the stock iPod headphones to fit my ear.  They didn't sound particularly good either.  So I knew I wanted to try something else.I first bought a pair of Sennheiser MX-500's, and while I actually liked their sound a lot (better than the stock iPod phones), they didn't fit my ears any better.  They'd fall out even if I so much as turned my head to one side.  One of my co-workers then recommended The Plug, and at such a low price I figured I'd give them a shot.I've now spent a few days with mine and my feelings on the whole are mixed, but I do feel these earphones are a pretty good value.  Most importantly to me is that so far, they're the only in-ear headphones I've found that don't seem to require constant fiddling to ensure they stay in place.  I do have to use the largest of the several types of included cushions - I apparently have very large ear canals - but they seem fairly secure (though not tight) once they're in there.  Some people may find this type of earphone uncomfortable - you really have to place them well up into your ear canals (make sure you clean your ears well every day!) - but I find them much more comfortable than the standard designs included with most portable players because you don't have this piece of hard plastic wedged into your ear.Sound-wise, I'd say they're fine, though certainly not remarkable.  My MX-500's sound better, and my SportaPros sound a *lot* better.  I'd put these about on par with the included iPod headphones.  They're pretty bass and mid-range heavy, though like other in-ear headphones the ""bass"" isn't really very bassy - it cuts off well above what most larger headphones can reproduce.  It ends up sounding a bit forced and artificially juiced, and there's a lot of this fake ""bass"".  On the high end, there's a lack of clarity - things like cymbal crashes sound ""muddy"" and ragged.  This is typical of low-end headphones of any type.Still, I'd rate the sound ""good enough"" considering the application most people will use these for (portable listening), and considering the increased comfort and dramatically better physical stability vs. more conventionally-designed in-ear headphones.",4
"I wanted to give ""The Plug"" a fair shot, so I bought a pair.  First of all, everything you have read about the stock foam earpieces is true; they are worthless.  The foam expands way too fast for you to compress it, shove it in your ear, and have it expand to get a good seal.So I followed some of the recommendations given in the reviews here, and modified some roll-up foam earplugs.  Now at least they will stay in my ears.I am recommending that people spend a little more money and buy the Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia earbuds, and here's why:-They seal really well to your ear canals, once you have selected the proper size silicone adapter.  The result is excellent bass.-You can put them in and pull them out really quickly.  On insertion, they just go in and seal, there is no waiting around for the foam to expand and seal.  You can quickly yank one or both of them out, and be able to plug them right back in.  This is really a good thing if you want to use them at work.-The sound of the Sony earbuds is just plain superior to the Koss'.  Really, it is.  They are worth twice the money of the Koss', which is about what they cost.About the only reason I may keep the Koss' around is that, with my foam earplug modification, they probably block more ambient noise than the Sonys, and they seem to be more efficient (more volume for a given drive level).  These two factors make them a good candidate for use when I am riding my motorcycle.  If it weren't for this, I wouldn't even consider them over the Sonys.",2
"I was intrigued by the raves for these very inexpensive headphones, and the Koss brand name convinced me to give them a try.I compared them to the Sennheiser HD56 headphones that I normally use for portables, and my AKG 240DF headphones that have been used by many studio engineers in recording albums.The Koss The Plug headphones have excellent dynamic range and sensitivity.  This means that you will get more volume out of weaker amps, such as those found in multipurpose portables, like PDAs and portable synths, like the Yamaha QY series.  They also have excellent bass, which together with the dynamic range, makes them excellent for any sort of modern dance music.Unlike another reviewer, I did not find any problem with the midrange or high end.  I suspect that this perception some people have had, is due to the fact that increasing the bass automatically makes the midrange and highs seem muted - especially in headphones.As others have mentioned, the fit is critical to the sound quality.  Read the instructions found on the inside of the card in the packaging.  Even the orientation of the earphones in your ear can affect the sound.  Experiment a little until you find the best sound.WARNING:  These headphones can go very loud with portables that have decent amps (MP3 and CD players).  Famous musicians like Pete Townsend and Jeff Baxter have hearing problems from hours of loud music - so be careful!",4
these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever. i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to  have the best sounding headsets for this price range.,1
"I was looking for headphones that I could be comfortable with for long periods of time.I use my mp3 player for listening to audio books, and the headphones that came with it became very uncomfortable after just a short period of time in my ears.  I also didn't want to spend a fortune.After much looking I decided to give these a try, and they have worked out great.  They are comfortable for as long as I wear them which has been many hours at a time.The cables are too long, which seems to be the case with any heaphones I've seen, so that's something to live with. For the price I don't think they can be beat.",5
"Not a lengthy review. Just my 2 to tell everyone who's curious aboutthese KOSS ""Plug's"" as I was a week ago.Very comfy in my ear. Stay put w/o falling-out.GREAT sound, deep bass & I still hear the highs too.Brings my mp3 player ""ALIVE"" at last.The free extra set of ""rubber/foam"" tips is great!Mine came in ""BLACK"", although any of the available colorslook great IMO.I started to buy the newer version of the KOSS earplugscalled the ""SparkPlug"", but after reading alot of userreviews, opted to buy these instead.They are well worth the $14. Don't hesitate if you're considering thisbrand. They have a LIFETIME guarantee (no questions asked).You'll be glad you got them...Hard to believe that some other brands sell for upwards of several hundred dollars.They simply CAN'T sound much (if ANY) better than these do. PERIOD",5
"These are great ear buds. If you squish the foam down and quickly put them in your ears, they expand and fit to your ears. Helps to block outside noises, and makes them comfortable. They feel secure and don't fall out if I'm moving around. Great for people who like to walk around with an ipod. Great bass, which is really important to me.",5
"I wrote a long review about all the benefits of these eaplugs, but then I figured - I'm the jillionth person to review these.  I'm not sure I can add anything, so I'll make this quick:Cool earphones. Work great, cost nothing, totally camouflaged.Not sure?  Buy both kinds.Thank You",5
"Two of my kids have a problem with keeping ear buds in their ears, always being too big for them. They love KOSS 'THE PLUG' IN-EAR HEADPHONES because you can manipulate them into your ear cannel, fitting snug. The only drawback is your earwax tends to cling to them, so they will need to be cleaned.",4
Good base and good sound. I buy one and usually send them back to Koss for $9 (lifetime warranty) when they crap out.  I'm a heavy user and use these virtually every day anywhere from 1.5- 7 hours/day.,5
I always get sore ears from the standard earbuds that iPods provide. I've got smaller-than-normal ears and the buds are really painful after a while. These Koss headphones are like little sponges that you squeeze when putting in. Then they expand to fit the exact size of your ear. Fantastic. They also have great sound. Definitely worth ordering.,5
"I bought these earbuds specifically to wear while riding a motorcycle. This application requires good sound isolation to protect against dangerous levels of wind noise and a close fit without protrusions poking into the helmet liner. The Plug received good reviews on a few MC forums so I had to try it.The noise isolation is OK, about as good as theKlipsch Image S2 Comfort-Fit Noise-Isolating Earphoneswith silicone mushroom-type seals. The photo of these Kosses is deceptive though, and the plastic part that stays outside your ear is much too big. Not only does it snag on my snug-fitting Shoei each time I remove it, the sharp edges of the silver-colored ring also dig into my earlobes. (The Klipsch are similarly too long, but at least they have no sharp edges.) For any other application these are probably a good value for money.tl;dr if your helmet fits correctly, these won't. I'm returning them.",2
"I've tried out a number of noise-cancelling and isolating headphones with an iPod. Here are my impressions:Shure E4c (isolating): the most accurate and open I know of. With high-quality source electtronics and material, these (or the E5c's) would be the pick of the lot. Unfortunately, they're too revealing for listening to compressed source material through the mediocre electronics of an iPod and very quickly become very fatiguing in that context. Their other disadvantage is obvious: they're quite expensive.Sennheiser PXC 300 (noise-cancelling): these are my favorites. Very accurate without being too unforgiving for an iPod. Their disadvantages:  comparatively bulky & won't play as loudly as any of the others mentioned here.Sennheiser CX300-B (isolating): considerably more compact and somewhat less expensive than the PXC 300, these are also quite good. Bass can be very tubby (that might be improved by stiffer custom inserts, but that would more than double the price)Koss ""The Plug"" (isolating): laughably innacurate. Buy these only if you have tin ears and a habit of losing small things on airplanes. Otherwise do yourself a favor and invest a bit more in one of the alternatives.",2
"These have very good bass, although they don't sound as good as my Sennheiser CX300. The price is cheap so I mainly use it when I'm on the streets so, if someone steals it I wouldn't get very angry.",4
"NOTE: the description I saw on the Amazon page does not reflect the product I have.  Above it discusses a headband and an adapter which are not part of this product.  Also, the rated frequency response is 10-20k, not 16-23k.  I think this is (or was) an Amazon editorial error.My interest for this product is as a solution to listening to music, lectures, and movies while travelling, and I travel a lot.  I have a set of Panosonic noise-cancelling headphones which were good (about five times more expensive than these earbuds) though bulky, but the plastic broke so they won't stay on my head now.These earbuds are an excellent alternative to noise-cancelling headphones for the frequent traveller.  I find them more comfortable for extended listening than most conventional headphones.  The ability to seal out noise from the external environment is very good, and makes it possible to understand what actors are saying when watching a movie on an airplane.The overall performance - sound quality and noise blocking - is not as good as the Bose noise cancelling headphones, but the Bose are 20 times as expensive, much less convenient to carry, and subject to damage from the rough world of the road warrior.  If The Plug had an optional noise-cancelling unit (say, combined with the eq), it would be a killer combination - are you listening, Koss?).The sound is good.  Bass-heavy, to be sure; I would like them better if they had a flatter response, but the product is marketed at the portable music crowd, and many of them are looking for dramatic bass rather than golden-ears sound.Besides, mobile sound is always a compromise, it's just a question of whether the compromise they chose works for you.Here are some problems I've heard and the solutions:1. ""They fall out of my ear.""  I think an older version of this product did not come with alternative cushions; the ones I bought recently (as pictured here) came with 3 alternative cushion pairs, one of which fit well in my somewhat large ears.  To make them fit well, roll the cushions in your fingers and squeeze them down, then hold them in place in your ears while they adjust the fit. Also, it is possible to fashion your own cushions (easy modification to commercially available ear plugs from pharmacy); go to google and search for ""koss plug mods"".2. What about when I have to replace the cushions, they'll get waxy/dirty with use?  See last sentence of #1.3. ""They sound tinny"".  I have a sense that the sound was tinnier on an earlier version of these earbuds, judging from comments I've read in feedback and on the koss plug mods page.  The purple plugs (as opposed to the older(?) blue ones) do not sound tinny to me; they seem a bit heavy on the bass instead.  Koss also makes a 3-band eq (20 dollars) for their headphones that can be used to adjust the sound some.  I have an eq on order, hoping it may temper the boomy bass a bit.  Of course, your player may have a way of changing the color of the sound, but my laptop does not.4. ""They're easy to lose.""  The price of their tiny size and negligible weight, is that you need to be careful not to lose them.  I've already lost a pair.  Koss also makes a carrying case which may help, or you could just put them in a 35mm film canister.  But at $... a pair (compared to $... for noise-cancelling headphones) I'll just keep a spare pair around in my travelling case.Overall I'm pleased with the price/performance tradeoff for these earbuds, and they are an essential part of my travelling kit.  They sound better than any other earbuds I've used, and they remove a good bit of the ambient sound, offering more pleasure in listening.  I give four stars out of five because I'd prefer a less bassy sound, though some people will really like the way they sound.",4
"I got these in spite of some of the poorer reviews, because I wanted some  earphones small enough to slip in my purse, but my ears are too small or  shaped in such a way that regular earbuds are impossible and/or painful to  wear. This seemed like the perfect alternative.And it *could* be.  However, the &quot;slow-recovery&quot; foam earplugs included are more like  fast-recovery. I've never seen foam earplugs that go to full size again so  fast. They really are tough to get in if you leave the headphones inserted.The trick I found was to slip the plugs off the headphone pieces, roll  it up really tight and insert JUST the plug into your ear. Then slightly  move it around until the hole for the headphone is lined up, and stick them  in through the hole. That's the only way I think you could ever get the  things in your ear.Other than that, I'm pleased enough with them. They  definitely are way more comfortable for me and stay in better than regular  earbuds. Really makes you wonder though, if they even had actual consumers  try the earplugs out before releasing them.",3
"I owned a pair of the older (blue and yellow) Koss Plugs and I modified them to fit better using Flents earplugs instead of the one Koss supplied (see the Headwize website for modifications you can do.)  Those worked ok (though they were still a little uncomfortable.) When I ordered this new version of Plugs I could not get them to fit right and the sound was really tinny. Fortunately I found the Sony EX-70LPs.  Much more comfortable than these, thank goodness!  No earphones fit everyone well, and the Koss earphones don't work well at all it you have shallow ears.  The Sony's also cost three times more than the Koss, but the comfort is worth it.",2
"I have tried many brands but the koss have been my favorite for years, yes they die but I use them during workouts, runs, etc. I would say I go through about 3/year and think they are well worth it. I also have the gold kdx models (two), sent them for repairs and the customer service was nice...thanks",5
"Didn't see that they were any better than other buds I have. Again, OK for the money. yo yo yo",3
"Good solid earbuds. The sound is surprisingly good, really a step up from the cheap sony $9.99 earbuds. They are very comfortable, and stay in your ear well. I can't stand the feeling of that coarse foam that is used on most headphones, so these are a great alternative.  Also, the 4' cord is nice, compared to most other earbuds that only have a 3' cord. The only potential problem I see, is that the cord is fairly small gage wire, hope it doesn't break, but they do have a lifetime warranty.",5
"Okay, the price of these has gone up since the last time I bought some (I've given a lot of these to friends... I'm wacky about them) but not by much. As was mentioned, they do crap out-- I've had one that quit working and another that broke while I was treating it very roughly. Anyway, I think that these are ideal if your player has an EQ on it. These, contrary to what another poster has mentioned, are *very* bassy. I've found that by plugging just about half of the little holes on the back attenuates the bass if an EQ isn't an option. They block sound quite well, better than any other non-active NR headphones I've used.The weakness in my experience has been treble-- I use the EQ to boost the treble and drop the bass and these sound spectacular (I have to do the opposite for my Grado headphones). I don't think that you could find anything better for this price (and I've tried). The other nice thing is that if they DO break or get lost, it's no big deal! Pair these with a cheap 1GB SanDisk player (the cheap SanDisks that I've used have EQs) and you have a nice, low-risk investment for the gym or anywhere else where they might be damaged.As for the poor bass comment-- they are tricky to get seated at first. Poorly seated Plugs will sound tinny and weak.Give them a shot! Not much to lose here.",4
"I tried the expensive active noise cancelling thing in stores (including Bose) and have always been disapoited that it should be more like ""Noise dampening"" but definitively not ""Cancelling""...same thing with this...you hear the outside world as you do when you use ear plugs (i.e. the noise is lowered) but when you play the music, particularly if you like to play it somewhat loud, then you can't really hear anything from outside!  For $10 I take that over the $300+ stuff any day!!  The bass is a bit strong for my taste, but I can adjust that on my MP3 player... I must warn you though, I'm not a audio file... I like a good sound, but that's about it...so if you try headphones like some people taste wines...then forget about my review...but if you want something that blocks the outside noise enough (I couldn't hear my loan mower while the music was playing, at all!!) while you listen to your music and don't want to spend a fortune, these things are great!! I'll be buying another set as soon as these die for sure!",5
"""The Plug"" offers VERY poor balance across the sound spectrum, they are very bass heavy/boomy, resulting in a very muddy sound. Unless you listen to your music with the bass turned ALL the way up, I suggest looking elsewhere.  Also, the acoustic tube is far too rigid and can scratch/gouge your ear canal.  Overall, a poor choice.",2
I bought 'The Plug' after reading all kinds of reviews for it and similar products. It really is a nice stereophone for the money. The sound quality is very good and I have not noticed that it has too much bass as several other reviews said. The ear-plug like ear pieces are pretty comfortable (I wear mine up to 8 hours a day) and provide moderate sound insulation. I would estimate they cut noise 10-15db (comparing them to the performance of earplugs rated at 32db). The only concern I have is that they are a little bit flimsy. I wear them every day at work in machine shop so the sound dampening is essential and enables me to listen to music except when using the noisiest machines.A great buy for the money.,4
"I use Sony 51's in the gym and they are a nice earbud phone but I've had them for awhile and wanted to try something else. I read some reviews and ordered these. First off they need to go it like hearing protection foam plugs. You squeeze and rotate the foam plug and insert it in your ear as you pull the top of your ear back with the other hand. They must be held in place for several seconds so the foam can expand and conform to your ear. If you insert them properly they do sound very good but with exaggerated bass. If you like exaggerated heavy bass these are for you. As for the guy who said buy a dozen or half dozen and thank him later, Idon't think that that's necessary. They are very nice sounding for the price and work good in the gym for me. If your mp3 player has an eq you can select a curve that makes them sound more realistic. Hope that helps!",4
"These headphones have excellent sound quality, especially in the Bass ranges. The foam pad is very comfortable and does not hurt my ear, even after hours. It requires a little more effort than most headphones to roll the cushion, put it in your ear canal, hold it and wait for it to expand, then carefully remove hand, but it pays off with noise reduction and great sound and a snug fit. The dark purple plastic is a little strange, and they do look funny, but that is a very minor detail. Great product.",5
"The ear cushions that come with this product are terrible.  I used an awl to make a hole in the earplug, and then cutoff a bit off the top of the earplug. I cut it off a bit too much,just cut it off a little.The sound from this product is great for an earbud style headphone.To increase isolation, I use a hearing protector ear muff on top of The Plug and I really can't hear anything after doing it.The main point, buy foam earlugs and these things will be a lot more comfortable and will let you enjoy your music more by eliminating background noise.",4
As a long time Philips HE592 user I was looking for something better or at least as good.  In a head-to-head comparision the results are clear.  The Koss require more power on the signal to create the sound (1.5-2x more).  The bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor.  There is not nearly as much bass as the HE592.  Compared to the HE592 it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal can.,2
These are actually a replacement.  My first set lasted for a few year and needed another.  Best earbuds for the money hands down!,5
"I have owned two pairs of these earphones, and I love them!""Noise cancelling wannabe's""... by me saying this I am applauding Koss for the price to quality ratio. You could spend $100+ for a noise cancelling pair of headphones, but I find that these headphones do equally good of a job (i have a pair of Creative noise cancelling headphones, and I prefer the Koss Plug).""w/modification""...If you replace the provided foam plugs with regular foam ear plugs, you will get a much better fit. Do this by triming a regular pair of foam ear plugs to the length of he ""canal"" on The Plug. Then drill a hole through the center using a small drill bit or use a needle and work around to make the hole bigger. This process is tedious I will admit, BUT having a clean pair (negates the CON listed below) that fits better than the provided foam plugs is well worth it. You will also find that the replacement plugs will stay compressed longer, making it easier to insert into your ear.CONS:the rubber ""canal"" that channels sound to your ear can fall off easily... if lose that.. its all over (this is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5). Build up of ear wax on the plugs (no matter how well u clean ur ears, you will get some dirt build up on these things.. replace the plugs every few months using modification above)PROS:price... deep bass (even w/o ""super bass"" systems)... noise ""cancelling"" ability (w/ modification listed above)",4
"Greatly enhance deep bass perception. Very comfortable fit. Balanced sound. Come with an extra set of silicon ear plugs. Potential problems: Not too good with treble highs. I recommend that you get it only if your portable device has a minimum 5-band equalizer or if you're not a treble fanatic. Also, the silicon plugs look like they might not last very long, but that's just speculation on my part since I've only had them for a few days. Finally, it insulates from all ambient sounds, so if hearing sounds around you while listening to your portable player is important, then you should consider another design.",4
"I needed some earphones that would be more comfortable and louder than the cheap earbuds I had.  I'm very happy with these on both accounts, and as a bonus they are much cheaper than a lot of the other options.",5
"I don't know if they still come with a lifetime warranty but I'd buy them over again even if they didn't.It's hard to find a pair of in-ear headphones that are rated 16 to 23,000 Hz. And if my memory serves me correctly, this design was groundbreaking and every one else copied them. I've always enjoyed the isolating aspect as well as the bass response from them.I've used the lifetime warranty a few times over the last 10 years and have had no problems.",5
These did not sound well at all and fit was even worse.  Ears got tired after just a few minutes during one song!,2
"Cannot accurately assess audio quality since the provided ear plugs did not fit properly, making it impossible to create adequate sound isolation.",3
"After all the grand reviews, I had really high hopes and expectations for these.  Unfortunately, they have all the depth of a 1970 transistor radio. I may have received the lemon pair but who wants to buy them again hoping for a better sounding ear bud?  Don't waste your time is my advice.  Find a genuinely well made ear bud.",1
"I think these work great.  fit well, sound is just fine, and for the price, I've not found anything remotely in the same league.  I can only assume the part about tasting good, as I have not eaten them myself, but my cat has devoured several sets, so my presumption is, in a pinch, wouldn't make a half-bad snack.",5
"Koss ""The Plug"" Portable Headphones are indeed best bang for your bucks!This product still after many years still on the market tells you that people are still buying them for their reliability and excellent sound quality.PROS:[+] Best Sound for the money, well balanced bass, mids and highs[+] Good construction and comfort[+] Small enough to be tucked away[+] Very good sound isolation and can be used in high noise environmentsCONS:[-] No con really but if you feel uncomfortable you can always modify the unit with other in-ear foams just use Google as your best friendNote:The new generation of KOSS Plug has slightly more hiss when you have very silent music the signal to noise ratio comes into play when there is improper impedance matching, I think it is due to the fact that they are now 16 ohms versus 32 ohms earlier? Correct me if I wrong.This was my ""Father's day"" gift from my daughter, my earlier KOSS Plug earphones which I purchased 7 years back (which still works) had very disgusting foam material due to daily use and abuse which my daughter could not tolerate, Seeing me squeezing that dirty foam into my ears made her buy me a new set of earphones! The new foam materials are better and hope this will last a decade just as the other.Buy with confidence these are excellent earphones!",5
"For me, these feel better and achieve a better seal than the norm.  A good seal is essential for achieving strong bass.  They are rated a little more efficient (the dB rating) than many of the others, and this was noticeable.",4
I bought these for my husband since he has sensitive ears.  He loves them!,5
"I bought these in January 2005, and the ones I got are apparently the new version.  There's no mute button or detachable headband as on the previous version, and the claimed frequency response has been improved to 10 to 20,000 Hz.  They are inexpensive, and come with a ""limited"" lifetime warranty.As far as sound quality, it is very good.  More importantly, they block all background noise so that I can actually hear the music when I'm sitting at the back of a bus or in a noisy location.  I prefer to listen to music at a quiet volume and it's nice not to have to blast my eardrums out just to hear the music.  The fit is very secure, which I also like (I always felt like my iPod-style headphones were going to fall out of my ears).",5
"I've used many low cost earbuds and there are a lot of decent ones out there. The really cheap ones are usually just that, cheap! I find the $10.00 to $40.00 range offer among the best qualities someone may be looking for in decent, good sounding earbuds. Most are good having varied degrees of what predominant type of sound you may be listening for.These Koss earbuds offer a very good bass range with overall good sound and volume. The mids and highs are not as crisp but usually can be adjusted well enough for good tone...these buds are mostly for strong bass.The fit of these earbuds is one of the most comfortable with nice cushy, foam inserts that stay in your ear well and really eliminate most outside noise. In turn, they also provide a very discreet listening experience. I find the best way to insert these buds is to give them a little squeeze and stick them in my ear and let the foam expand in my ear.Overall, the build quality of these earbuds appears to be quite good with minimal wire to bud noise transfer.",4
These earplugs fit well and sounded pretty good. Bass response wasn't that great but what do you want for the price?,4
"LOUD AS HELL! And sound proof to the world. You wont hear much past whats pumping through your headphones. Bass is nice and deep. Sharp sound. Not for anyone that doesn't like things in their ears. Best part, if you are a deaf fella like myself, you can pop the foam off of these and the tubes are the perfect fit for your old hearing aid in ear molds. Can get that perfect fit.",5
I bought this for me. But my kids love them so much I have to buy a send set. They are that good.,5
"For an earbud these are amazing.  The sound quality rivals much larger, heavier and more expensive traditional circumaural earphones.They key is being sure you position them properly.  You'll know when you do because bass notes easily roll off when the seal and orientation of the plug is wrong.  To get the most out of these, compress the foam by rolling it in your fingers and immediately put them in your ears.  Twist gently to seat them and you will be rewarded with good clear sound.The lifetime warranty is a plus.For the price these represent a truly great value",5
"I can't simply understand nature of such negative feedbacks.Don't like sound quality/durability/usability/etc? - Check price tag, scratch your head, try to find same durability/usability/etc for same price, I bet you can't.So this headphones perform amazingly well, compared to their $12 price tag. So don't expect $100 quality from these.If you still wonder what quality of sound these have, here's comparison with other KOSS products. This (The Plug), sounds worse than Koss Porta Pro, but sounds better than Koss UR10 (but you need heavy EQ usage to actually set these ""plugs"" to be better then UR10). Hope this helps.",3
"these babies sound pretty sweet for $12! Don't waste your dough. Get these, and turn DOWN the bass on your iPod (set EQ to electronica), they'll sound frickin sweet!",5
There are more expensive ear plugs but these work very well. I use them when I jog and while on the motorcycle.,4
"This is my 3rd pair in about 10+ years. I wear them practically every other day - exercising or working in the yard. These are actually better than the previous ones (from the same manufacturer) that I bought at a brick and mortar.  Those had a very annoying ""mute"" button on the cord. These do not. Compared to other ear plugs (or in the ear headphones) that I have, I can use these when I run or bike (in the summer) without them falling out. I've paid over $30 for others that didn't work half as well.",4
"I now own three pair of these,  They are a bargain, as I have dozens of earbuds (mostly in ear) and their efficiency and sealability give a full rich sound.  The only pair I ever &#34;broke&#34;  was a pair that I sent through the wash TWICE!  You will spend at least 2-3 times their price to beat them.  One audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better (at $299.00)  Again, best value given their  price and performance.",5
"Let me preface this quick review with the statement that I already own the Shure E2 in-ear headphones, which are well known for their excellent sound quality.  I did not purchase ""The Plug"" with expectations of anything near the experience I have had with the E2's.  The E2's are not perfect, however, and I've saved up some gripes for that review as well.In any case, I bought ""The Plug"" as a backup and alternative to my other headphones, and I have many.  On the New York City subways and city streets, isolating headphones are the only way to really hear your music without getting those huge over the ear style headphones.  I see everyone with the white iPod style earbuds - can you even hear your music?  I swear that I had to turn the volume up all the way to even hear the music over the din of the city streets.So, I'm already a convert to the in-ear experience.  These headphones, however, are a total bummer.  They don't fit in my ear with any of the built in foam inserts.  They hurt.  The sound is tinny, tiny and has no bass whatsoever.  I tried every permutation of different foam plugs with no luck.I'm sure the poor sound is entirely because they don't seal in my ear canal well.  I looked around on the web - other people are having the same problem, and have gone so far as to create their own foam plugs to fit their ears better.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time nor the inclination to bother.  So, back they go.",1
"For a younger person with perfect hearing these might have less fidelity than others.  However, these are extremely comfortable.  The isolation from the outside noise is better than most other ear bud style phones.  And, they don't have the fall out problems associated with typical ear buds.  Koss, ""Sparkplug"" earphones are also worth consideration.  The Sparkplug model earphones sound about the same, but have a little higher profile out of ones ear.",5
"127 reviews later, i'll sum up the critical reasons why *i* absolutely love these ""stereophones"".i've tried a LOT of different earbud headphones looking for that obnoxious, over the top, chest-pounding heart attack bass sound that typifies my favorite style of music, drum'n'bass. they all fell far, far short compared to the PLUG. i was even willing to spend the big money on those Shure's and Etymotics but i've read they are weak with bass as well. dont bother with those sony ex51/71 fontopia's. they were a huge sonic disappointment and they have that stupid long right/short left cable arrangement. not these puppies. symmetrical cables baby!bad parts:1) eventually the foam cushions go ""bad"" from too much use and dont ""inflate"" the way they used to after being squeezed, causing them to fall out and dampen that beautiful bass. i used to just buy a new set when this happened (~1 year) but i just found out about these ""plug mods"" so i'll try that now.2) ear wax buildup! eeewww! yes, well, what else did you expect? luckily the plugs lend themselves to a very easy clean if you have a paperclip or baby pin. but they do get very juicy pretty fast so dont buy these suckers used or try to share with your buddy.3) purple color is lame.4) no case provided and its gross sticking juicy buds in yr linty pants pocket and then putting em back in your ear.if you are some audiophile nerd who is more interested in highs than lows, i can't recommend these at all. if you've ever said ""turn the bass down"" out loud to someone, keep searching. but if you like the feeling of a big foam bullet gradually expanding in your ear like a snuggly pillow, pick these up today.",5
"I love these headphones and have been using them for years.  My kids (8 and 10) discovered them and now won't use any others.  They are very comfortable and block out outside sounds when you are using them.  Only downside is that they aren't very durable, but Koss give a lifetime warranty on them and you just have to pay for shipping to get them replaced.",5
"I have purchased about 10 sets of these over the past few years. I keep them everywhere - car, PC bag, desk, gym bag. They last forever, they fit snugly, they are great on the plane because they block the noise - and the price is terrific. Unlike other ""sit in the ear"" products, these stay. I ever wear them while riding the lawnmower, with big ear protector headphones over them, and it makes the work go faster and not seem like work.",5
"I bought these because my wife has trouble getting regular earbuds to stay put when she goes jogging.  For the most part, they fit nice, but you have to know how to insert them properly.  I roll them between my thumb and finger so that they are long as skinny, then insert them into my ear and wait for them to expand... just like putting in foam earplugs.  For me, they fit well, and seem like they'd stay in better than the rubber-tipped earbuds.It's a shame they sound like a Hallmark musical greeting card playing inside a tin coffee can.  These are bargain basement earbuds, so I certainly wasn't expecting them to sound like Sennheiser headphones, but I did expect them to at least match the sound quality of my off-brand earbuds that I got for like a dollar and a half on some Chinese *ahem* ""extreme deal"" website.  They don't.  The bass is just non-existant.  For something that isolates the air inside your ear canal, bass should be its strong point.",1
"These earbuds are the solution to all of your travel needs. Lets face it, public or commercial transportation is not known for its quiet atmosphere. I'm sure you will agree that you are always trying to raise the volume high enough to drown out the background noise, but the headphones just can't do it. The Koss Plug is the answer.I spent 20 years in the Air Force and I have gone through three sets of these. These are the only headphones that I could use while riding on military cargo planes without wearing ear plugs and without cranking the volume to max. Ever time I thought I found something better, they never could reach the level of noise isolation that the Koss Plugs provide. The bass level is superior to every budget or midrange priced similar devices. If you don't mind wearing ear plugs, these are perfect for you. If you don't like wearing ear plugs, get over it; these plugs are worth the the annoyance.",5
"The sound of it is ok but, the fit is terrible after a while of use they starting to hurt and itching inside the canal ear.",1
"Just bought these - they isolate sound, have very good high-end, are comfortable and stay in my ear (most ear buds fall out). I also bought a pair of the Coby CVE92 ear buds because I thought they'd fit as well. Sure enough they do, but they sound terrible in comparison. In addition, these have a lifetime ""no questions asked"" warranty - that's gold, my friend.",5
"Although it costs twice as much in US funds, I'm very satisfied. My first pair had a button to stop sounds and extra plugs plus a case. It broke two months after, since I tied it to make it shorter. One side wasn't functionning well because of that. I used it in the plane and it blocked 70% of the engine noise! Economy class really spikes your ears so they should sell these in airports. Also the plastic dried up(I don't know why!).My tip: never tie the wires! it causes the metalic wires inside to break. Because of this, it costs me hundreds of dollars.My second set was simpler, but at the same price as my first. No more annoying button to stop music. The tube that you see when you removed the plugs was mostly rubber(unlike totaly in plastic) so it's improved. The extra plugs where all different sshapes and sizes so there are some that I can't use. The main problem is that sometimes I sleep on my side while wearing them and the plug breaks.Second tip: I have two versions, blue/yellow and purple/gray. What you get in the package is sorta different so choose carefully! The mute button can be easily pressed... so it's a small hint.Third tip: if it doesn't fit, change the plugs or turn and push it in your ear. It doesn't really fit when only pushed.Fourh tip: smaller plugs are better for best sound proof and quality.Finally: the plugs with break down, piece by piece, until it doesn't fit if you unplug and plug them often. The mute button was meant for that if it helps you purchase.I'll only buy these kind of earphones since it's like plugging your ears with rubber corks and istening to music at the same time. The price in Canada is kinda steep... if you buy it here you save 40%(with the currency and taxes)!",5
"i bought these because of the isolation feature. i needed some earplugs because riding in a helicopter is just boring without music. I can ride in a blackhawk or chinook and listen to these at a comfortable volume, without hearing too much of the engine noise. a very minor thing is if you use these while running you will  hear yourself breathe a little louder than normal. its semi annoying, but im used to it now. would definately recommend for the price and quality.",5
For the price you pay these are pretty good headphones.  Fit better than most in your ears and last FOREVER.  Not the best you will find but for listening to books or music on walks or traveling they work perfect.,5
"Been using these ear plugs for may years - and I like them.  Good sound, inexpensive and they STAY in my ears and block external sounds quite well.Biggest complaint - the cord - rather the rubber used.  If they would upgrade the cord (to something more like the ipod headphones) this would be great.  The cord has &#34;memory&#34; for curls, bends, etc.  Won't stay straight. Just a bit annoying!Different productions have either straight or 90 degree phone jacks.  I have had both.  The 90 degree version seems more relaible.Only one oddity - different productions seem to have different sounding driver frequency responses.  Some of them seem to be overly bright (in treble) others seem to be heavy in the bass.  I just wish they were consistant.",3
"Definitely not high-quality, but good enough for the average person. At such a low price I have an extra pair on hand in case my kids break one of theirs, so we have a total of 4 sets in the house. If you want audiophile quality, you'll need to pay a lot more, but at less than $20, these deliver decent sound and I don't get sick every time I step on one or break a wire. For sound I'd rate them 4 stars, for durability I'd give them 2 stars, and price is a 5.",4
"I ordered these because my very favorite earbuds broke and needed a cheap pair untill they are fixed. You get what you pay for. Not comfortable and they have a feedback.  Airbuds makes a pair called,&#34;the most comfortable earbuds&#34;,  well, they are and have fantastic sound!",2
"I like how the foam plugs conform to your ear, but if you want them in tight - like for running - and you don't get them wedged in just right, the foam will squeeze shut and block the sound.",4
"UPDATE - I've stopped using this product and switched to a similar Skull Candy product. I used Koss for years and was a loyal customer. I kept having these break, at a rate of about one a month, and I was gentle with them! I think the company has seriously cut back on quality. I liked the sound and foam sound blocking, but reliability became a problem.ORIGINAL REVIEWI've owned several sets of earbuds and these are just great especially and truly when you consider you can get these for well under $20.For me the biggest issue with any ear bud or portable headphone is they let in far too much noise. You can spend a bazillion dollars on a set of snazzy phones, but if there's a baby crying next to you, well you're sound experience is going to be less than ideal. For a city denizen like me, common noise pollution is subway trains, sirens, chatty cell phone blatherers etc. Airplanes are another problem for portables because of noise.  The plug, by blocking outside noise so effectively, solves this problem.Another bonus you don't see often is that Koss backs all their products with a lifetime warranty.  Send them a check for $6 to cover shipping and they will fix or replace your plugs, even if you don't have a receipt!!The plug is big sound in a very portable package.  I'm hooked.",3
"Try to get the metallic silver and purple in color koss plug earbuds as the sound is phenomenal for the price. I had a fairly expensive pair of sony earbuds that were around $40.00 and one channel crapped out after about 6 months. hard to believe, but the koss plug earbuds sound way better then the more costly sony. go figure.For the price and the sound, these earbuds can't be beat. good going Koss.",5
"These are great little headphones for the price.  They're just like foam earplugs.  There is a proper way to squish and insert earplugs, believe it or not.  Most people just press a couple times without any thought and shove.  You have to ""roll"" these between your fingertips really well, evenly, over and over.  If you don't, they will expand too fast and you'll have trouble, especially when new.  The more you use them, the better they get until the foam finally breaks down and you go to the replacement foam.  I only use these when traveling and they knock down the noise down from planes, considerably.  These are your best bet for the money.  Ignore the reviewers that state that their double and triple priced headphone are better.  DUH!!! What would you expect!!!  If you buy a car for 10,000 don't expect 20,000 or 30,000 dollar features and performance.  Someone actually compared these to 80 dollar Shure headphones!!!  Also, any self-proclaimed, pretentious, audiophile that buys these for 10 bucks and expects audiophile performance is just being ridiculous.  Come back to Earth, please.  I have used these on all forms of media and have yet to be disappointed.  They will definitely show the flaws in any recordings because the sound is isolated and aimed directly at your eardrum.  This is one reason I would NEVER give it to a little kid.  If you like to save space on your Ipod and go with a low quality setting, your mistake will be painfully obvious.  It will also be painfully obvious when you listen to the some of the cheap/low quality recordings and incompetent audio engineers of late.These will not fit everybody's ears on the entire planet!",5
"I bought these to knock out some of the noise from a busy 35mph street I walk next to for my walking commute. I carefully squished the pads and let them expand in my ears forming a fairly high pressure seal.  They maybe take a couple Db off the road noise, barely taking the edge off.  I can drop down the volume a notch or two from where I would with my other open air Koss headphones.  But that is more because there is a tube shooting the music into your ears.  Sound is not up to my other cheap Koss headphones.  And the wires could literally not be any thinner or more delicate.  I bought these Koss because I like my other cheap Koss &#34;over-ear-clip open-air&#34; headphones so much and the cord was nice and  beefy on those.  I tried someones suggestion of replacing the pads with official ear plugs, trimmed to length and a hole punched through.  That helped a tiny bit more.  Noise leak seems to be right through the headphone itself.  If you try to replace the pads, I suggest, scissors, a heated ice pick, pointy chopsticks, and lots of patience.",2
"Better than I could have hoped. They are comfortable, sound great and are an incredible deal from one of the best names in sound. Makes my iPod Touch the music machine I always wanted.",5
"Here's the good stuff: great isolation from outside noise, comfortable, damned near excellent bass, and very power efficient. But I'm returning my pair to Tower Records where I just bought them for $15. Why? Because the sound itself is truly awful: compressed, dead, flat, hazy, and tinny (the great bass notwithstanding). These 'phones literally suck the life out of my music, by destroying its dynamics, detail, rhythm, tonal accuracy, and high frequencies, and then layering a harsh fuzziness on top of that. I can't say enough bad things about the actual sound. I suspect you can have a more rewarding musical experience at your dentist's office. I know I did.",2
I like:- Quality sound.I do not like:- Easily drop of my ears- I have to squeeze hard to fix the ear and it bothers.,3
"these headphones to me are my favorite, after you get used to squeezing them and setting them up correctly in your ear. they reduce outside noise and sound great with bass. plus when you workout or mow the lawn you dont have to turn up your music as loud with other headphones, this is very nice with big yards and helps keep your hearing from getting damaged.",5
"For $15, by far the best choice for portable applications, particularly when there's a moderate level of ambient noise.  Excellent for Walkman or MP3 player use at the gym; they block enough sound so that I can hear the music, but I can still hear if someone is talking to me (although I have to remove at least one of the plugs in order to hear what they're saying).Be sure to save the spare ear foam pieces - you'll probably need them eventually, since they don't fit as well after they soften up too much.",5
"These really are fine headphones, particularly for use inside a motorcycle helmet. But they are cheaply made compared to, for example, the headphones bundled in an iPod. The wiring insulation is a little sticky and gets tangled easily, and the wires themselves are high-gauge and skinny.EDIT: OK, after months of use, the Plug headphones just keep holding up for dozens and dozens of motorcycle trips. My earlier accusations of flimsiness were obviously ill-informed; these $14 headphones are a fantastic deal and they outlasted my iPod original headphones.EDIT 2: I finally beat the heck out of these headphones and decided to replace them after about 1.5 years of wearing a motorcycle helmet over them. Overall a very good value for the money. The new headphones work just as well, except that Koss has replaced the smooth PVC wire insulation with some new stuff that has a roughened, sticky texture. And it does stick, to itself and to everything else, making them slightly less functional.",3
"I like these, they sound good, are priced reasonable, block out all other sound. My only complaint is that I cant find the soft replacement ear buds. I have purchased ones that are said to be replacements but they seem harder & are not as easy to roll. Think I will need to buy a new pair in order to get the soft ones.",4
The ear buds make nice ear plugs.  I wear them at work to block out noise. Sound quality is good but not the best.  They came with 3 different sized buds.  I think they are a good value for the price.,5
"In no means are these headphones studio quality. These are for the person on the go and no I don't mean running. The foam snuggles fits in the ear canal and does do a very good job a cancelling out noise. The base is okay, but you can always get a mini amp to create more bass or go into a devices settings to increase it. I did this on my IPhone 3GS and I was please with the results. Other than that it is a neat little accessory for my music taste.",5
"I thought these would be a good travel idea, to block out external noise.  That they do, in a small, cheap package.  For that, they get a 2 instead of a 1.The bass that is trumpeted by the marketing is certainly there as well. But it simply sounded ""thuddy and muddy"" - we're talking quantity over quality in the bass department. In fact, these are probably the worst sounding headphones I've ever used. In the end, I preferred putting up with outside noise in my other phones (a nothing-fancy Sony pair) than listening to these.I also found them quite uncomfortable to wear for extended periods, but that can be a highly personal thing.All in all, the best part of these was taking them out.",2
Just as expected,4
Made from cheap materials but an okay product,3
So far so good!  Perfect volume control!  I highly recommend it!,5
Works great for metal detectors that don't have volume control,5
"I was looking to control the volume out of my Samsung UN40EH6030, which has a fixed volume output out of the 3.5mm jack. I wanted to used headphones when watching BluRays or playing 360, so I got one of these instead of an expensive amplifier. Works beautifully; no noise and the volume is sufficient. Excellent product for this type of use.",5
"The product works as advertised, and is very simple to use. I am using it to control the volume on an external speaker connected to a Spirit Box for use in investigations for my paranormal research group.",5
Doesn't have much range. This definitely decreased the volume in my headphones. It works as a volume control but it shouldn't decrease the volume to do so.,2
"And when you need a volume control (down only) in a 3.5mm format, this one works fine.  It is not an amp, just a volume control.",4
"Whereas this device will allow you to adjust the volume, the range is limited from no sound to the volume you'd have without it.  I had gotten the [apparently mistaken] impression that it would boost the volume for headphones which had low volume for some sources (like Zune, IPod), but that does not appear to be the case.  Since you can always lower the volume on the source (mp3 player, etc.), I'm having a hard time seeing the value of this device - except that in some cases it might be handier to have an inline control.",2
It worked fine for a few months but now the sound coming out is really fuzzy in other words it's ready for the garbage... hold on... ok it is now in the garbage can. Btw I never moved this around at all.Good thing I waited to review this.,1
"I just got these today and so far they are exactly what I wanted. I have read some reviews about the sound quality being bad when you turn it down low. Honestly, if your turning your music down that low then your obviously tyring to pay attention to other things. I tried my headphones with the controller on and off and i don't hear a difference. It is a delicate thing. Very light. My ONLY complaint is that I wish the volume control wheel was a little longer but it is something I can easily deal with. I will update in a few months or if something happens.",5
"Works as advertised, well worth money spent Koss makes great products for the home or car, so if you want or need a volume control then this one is for you!",5
"The volume controller is reasonably well designed; no crackling drop out of volume, or other distortion during use.  It's ergonomics allow it to feel good in either hand.  The connecting cord is to short and the quality of the wire feels cheap.  This product was a recent purchase, so I can not comment on longevity.",4
the koss vc 20 volume control works well. however it is cheaply made & if you start to leave the room without removing your headphones you might find yourself needing a new volume control. spend a little more & get one that is not so flimsy. again to it`s credit the device what it was designed for.,3
"I bought this in order to inexpensively kill the AGC of my video capture card. When the volume was lowered closer to where it was barely audible, there was lots of crackling and distortion. Upon examining its audio waveform at the lower settings, the negative phase of both channels was becoming increasingly truncated/clipped. Depending on what it's connected to, it's good for slightly controlling the volume; however, look into using an amp, instead, for maximum volume control.",3
"This is a lifesaver for using headphones with my Dell D610 laptop which boasts an extremely noisy headphone jack with lots of interference at low volumes. Using this volume control, I can turn up the volume on the Dell to overpower the static while keeping the volume of the music in my ears low.The control is even less sexy than the picture on the website, if that's possible. It also doesn't work great for an extremely loud source (like my Dell port replicator's line out port), because the sound from the volume control doesn't seem to be output equally in both ears at low levels.",4
"All I wanted was a simple slider device to adjust volume so I wouldn't have to keep pulling the ipod out of my pocket at Starbucks to adjust the volume on the unit. Mostly this has very little ability to increase sound... very good at lowering the sound. I guess that makes sense... If I turn up the ipod volume to the max, then I turn the Koss down to get to the level I want it works ok. Actually I wanted something more like my Sennheisers where I can adjust the volume either way. Another waste of my funds.. too inexpensive to return... too useless to keep... you can buy this one at the Goodwill Store next week.",1
I bought this so that I could easily control the volume on my iPod Touch during bike rides and it does the job perfectly.,5
I connected the speakers in my hot tub to my computer so I needed a volume control at the hot tub - works perfectly!,5
"I have had four different volumen controls. Two on the earplugs, and two on a seperate controls like the Koss VC20. This is deffinately the easiest access volume control I have used. You do not have to search to find the volume control. It is a simple roll knob that is easy to find. Note, that if you care, this is not an L shaped plug as shown in the product image. I might mention, I am not that concerned about high quality. I only use the mine to listen to audio books, which this seems to be fine for so far. But will get some tough use. I broke the last two earphones (quite expensive ones)at the plug, and decided breaking a volume control would be cheaper. I broke that as well. I thought I would try an ""L"" plug connection. I failed to notice the photo of the notes from Deepanker at the top which shows this is a straight line plug. I will see how this one goes.Koss VC20 Volume Control",4
Works great and I'm glad I got this with the purchase of my new Audio-Technica ATH ANC7 headphones.,5
"Construction isn't that heavy duty, but if you want to reduce the output of electronic, stereo devices to match the input of what you're connecting it to - it works.  Price was right and is convenient for my purposes.  I recommend it - all things considered.",5
The product works as advertized.  The adjustment wheel is fine enough that the volume can be tuned in very precisely.  The wheel is recessed below the side surface of the body to avoid accidentally adjusting the volume and protect the wheel from damage.  The cord is perhaps thinner than I would have expected but should be ok.  The body of the device is very light plastic but seems rugged enough.  If the product proves to be durable I will change my rating to a 5....  I recently updated the review to a 5 star rating.  I have had no issues with this adapter.,5
"I loved this when I had it but I unfortunately lost it when I was out one day.  I primarily used it to make my headphones at the time longer so I could lay down in bed and watch tv.  It did not affect the volume or quality.  I also used it to make my earbuds longer while I was on the go, I primarily use public transportation, so I could put my mp3 player in my bag and simply use the volume control as needed since I would clip that part to my pants or my bag.I plan on getting a replacement.",5
"I purchased this item with a new pair of headphones for my wife and I to use with our laptop. The Koss volume control does exactly what it's supposed to and is a handy convenience to adjust volume quickly and easily. I didn't notice any signal degradation as a result of having the volume control plugged in-line with the headphones. If you need a little extra cord length then that would be an added benefit. My wife absolutely loves the convenience but I've concluded I could just as easily live without it.Should you buy it? Just answer three questions and you'll have your final answer. 1) Would you prefer a little extra cord length? 2) In everyday headphone use, do you find yourself frequently adjusting the volume? 3) Do you have the extra cash to burn?My wife answered yes to all three while I answered no. Did we keep it? You know what they say, happy wife, happy life. :)",4
"These work fine but have a short working lifespan. I have owned two VC20's and both stopped working in stereo, then altogether. They were used only for listening in bed so they were not abused. I liked the volume control but would like to see them better made, even at a higher price.",3
"This is my second one, I could never get my first one from my wife so I needed to buy one for myself,  It works well and is relatively inexpensive.It is a great buy for the money and I have had several other Koss products before and alway been very satisfied with them",5
"I would have liked to see a larger dial that offers more levels, but if you need a simple volume control than this is the one.",4
This is a perfect companion piece for my f11 line-out dock and bluetooth transmitter/receiver for my ipod.  Allows me to control the volume at the mobile end of the set-up.  clip on back allows me to keep it handy.My only complaint is the small size of the volume control wheel.  It could stand to be larger and have some sort of tactile method of adjusting the volume before pressing play.,4
"I have one of these between my CarPC and AMP input.  The soundcard was putting out to much power, turning the volume up to 10 out of 100 on the PC would almost blow the speakers.  This thing was the quick and easy fix to give a little more breathing room to the PC volume.  I haven't noticed any sound quality loss though I dont have the nicest of speakers to notice fine detail.",5
"This in-line volume control can be used in several situations. As a wearable, it has a clip (like on a pen) so you can attach it to a pocket, sleeve or collar so it won't be flopping around like a cord mounted control.  In my case I used a small piece of double sided tape to inconspicuously mount it to the side of a table next to my chair to control the volume of the earbuds I wear while watching TV.The volume control range is from full off to full on and there is no static when operating the control and no distortion in sound quality at any setting.My only very minor complaint is that the control wheel is a bit too recessed so you have to only use the tip of your finger. That's probably a plus if you're wearing it as it's less likely to be moved by just brushing against it.It's well worth the price and I would buy it again",5
"I typically have my ipod in a leather case, tucked in my pocket, and I don't want to have to dig it out when I want to adjust the volume.  This device is a practical & inexpensive solution to that function.",4
"I have the controller on the outside of my motorcycle helmet. It's hooked up it a Pyle headphone amp and XPro speakers. Absolutely no issues with this controller. It would even work great if I was an idiot and was doing 100+ on my bike, but I would never do that. ;)",5
"I would like the volume wheel to be bigger or stick out more, so it would be easier to use. The plug is straight, not L shaped as shown in the current picture. The cord is 36 inches. I use this with my MP3 player because I'm trying to minimize wear and tear on my old player and I don't like my panasonic headphone volume control slider thing. I didn't want the thin metal pocket/belt clip, but fortunately I was able to pull it off with some thin pliers.",4
"I initially used the KOSS Volume Control inline with headphones, in order to listen to the TV late at night, without disturbing others. We have a 5.1 speaker system, controlled by one speaker volume knob (no remote control). It's wired from the TV to a 1/8"" Y/duplex plug; one line continues to the speakers, the other goes to the headphones. Turn the speakers down all the way, and you only hear it through the headphones. Ok so far.But, guess what happens when you have the speakers up halfway, with the headphones plugged in, and you change the volume on the headphone using the KOSS Volume Control? The volume of the external speakers changes! Huh? How is that possible? It was odd at first, but if you lowered the KOSS unit's volume, the speaker's volume went up. Raise the KOSS volume, the speaker's volume went down. It's something to do with the amount of signal strength going to the headphones that sucks it from the 5.1 speakers. I had to add a label ""Loud"" and ""Soft"", mounted just the opposite of the Low-to-High volume legend near the control wheel, since it controlled the speakers opposite of what you'd think.So the KOSS Volume Control can function as a wired speaker volume control as well, provided that headphones are wired in parallel to the speakers. Who knew?p.s. I like it so much, I'm buying another.",4
"Performs as advertised. Some people have noted a drop in audio quality, but to a person with average ears such as mine, your audio should sound almost exactly the same. The price is definitely fair.The one problem I've encountered so far is that the volume dial is recessed from the side, so I have to use my fingernail to turn it. But it's only a minor annoyance since the product works.",4
"This review is for the Koss Volume Control only.A volume control that I can reach anytime, and it works.A volume control for all devices, and it has the 3.5mm mini-plug. The control includes a clip to attach it to any clothing, too.This is the best separate volume control I have found. I use it with my headphones, and control volume on all my devices with it. It makes changing the volume very easy. Mine did come with a straight plug on the end, instead of the angled plug as shown in the image.This volume control worked better than I expected. I can now control the volume on each device I use with the same control. Instead of trying to remember all the volume controls and where they are, I plug this into my headphones and use it with everything. Other than the plug being straight, there were no surprises.Having tried many volume controls, both separate and integrated, I found this one very easy to use. It is much better than most of the controls out there. Set the volume up fairly loud, and then use this to control it as needed. It works great.",5
"Purchased to be used to adjust the volume of my Pro 4AAT phones while snoozing at night, the tiny volume control, no balance, and flimsy construction make these useless for me.At $10, not worth the hassle of returning.Koss should not put their name on such a piece of junk. Next time, I'll pay more and buy something better.",2
It was bought in case I had issues hearing from a pair of earbuds that I bought and it works great.,4
"This product is great. When my wife & I both want to share a wired connection to an audio source, I don't have to have her continually telling me to turn it down...it's too loud. I bought this for her to turn Her's down while I enjoy it at a level I can hear. Too many years of loud music and loud guns with no hearing protection. Sometimes, it's not always &#34;convenient&#34; to used hearing protection. They didn't have those high-tech ear-plugs back in the day and a lot of us older baby-boomers have lost significant hearing as a result.",4
"I use headphones at night to watch TV and this helps because I can clip it to my PJ's & adjust the sound level, on our 'ME' TV channel the commercials are at a higher sound level then the show even though there is now a federal law against this practice .... The wheel that makes the adjustment is VERY touchy, takes some practice to get used to it, so it lost a star because of that ...",4
"If you have a device that allows for headphones, but doesn't have a volume adjustment, this is for you.I've been using this to ""tone down"" the audio that is sent from my Xbox 360's audio dongle. The volume control has lasted well since the purchase, with no visible signs of wear, in spite of being used while traveling. Also, the sound quality is pretty good, with no detectable leakage.I would greatly recommend this.",5
"I have a Koss Pro/4 A Plus headset that delivers incredible sound reproduction, but doesn't have an inline volume control.  I was considering ordering another headset with inline volume control, but was reluctant to do so because of the quality of my current Pro/4's.  Searched on Amazon and found this Koss VC20 volume control which is the perfect companion to my headset.As one of the other reviewers rightly stated, this device in not an amplifier.  Therefore please note the following:  one has to turn up the sound on the output device (an iMac in my case), connect the VC 20 volume control to this device, connect the headset to the the VC 20 and then adjust the sound to one's liking.  Very simple to do.  This makes for a superb listening experience.  Works on a computer, iPad, iPhone, etc., and can be used if jogging, exercising or just walking.I've been a fan of Koss for years because of the quality of their products.  This volume control carries on their commitment of making quality products.  Very pleased...",5
"It does what you would think it would; nothing more and/ or less.As far as I can hear (I used a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50's plugged into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 [studio quality set-up]) there is no loss in sound quality.I initially just needed an extension to prevent exerting too much tension on a heavy headphone cable. However, I figured being able to adjust the volume with an analog control would be a nice bonus. And it is!It does it's job and at that it does it simply and wonderfully.(Edit: After a while of use I noticed that it subdues the highs, lows, and even at the highest volume it is slightly quieter than without it. Still a good buy though!)",4
"This works well but maybe I am short; well no maybe, but the wires for this are so long it detracts a little from the enjoyment end up bundling them together.  Main thing is they work well.",3
"Good quality, no impact on audio quality.The wheel is small and recessed.  Maybe it was designed like this to prevent inadvertent movement if the device is in a pocket, etc.  But it kinda defeats the purpose of having an inline control if you're gonna stick it in your pocket.  Anyway, the a larger wheel or more open access would be an improvement.",4
I bought this to be able to control audio volume.  Similar devices of other brands/no brands purchased in the past all just disintegrated; Koss is built much better and so far so good.  No complaints.,5
"I bought this to control the volume of my Audio-Technica M50 headphones (which have no in-line volume control). The headphones are VERY loud when plugged directly into the computer when the system volume is any higher than 2%, so having a mechanical limiter like the VC20 is essential.So far I have no real complaints. Initially I was skeptical about the thin dial, but I've grown to like it - it's easy to find by feel in the dark, but difficult to bump accidentally.The plug end is a little skimpy, but since the control will live by my computer I'm not worried about durability.I can't give a scientific opinion about the sound quality - I'm sure there's some quality loss introduced by putting this device between the source and the headphones, but I'm unable to discern a difference. The sound coming from my M50's is still very nice!I wish it had a mute button, but for the price I can't complain. :-)",5
Simple in-line volume control. Works as its supposed too which is all we can ask. No issues with it at this time.,4
This allows me to control the volume on my head phone instead of have to use the mouse on the laptop.I like it alot. Is also used when hooked up to the headphones for the tv or the mp3 player. Very convenient.Recommend. works great.,5
use headphones with the speaker output on my tv. There is no volume control on that output. added this inline before my headphones. Works perfect.,5
"If you have a television that does not give you variable output to headphones, this is what you need. It words simply said, better then I thought!",5
Digital portable radios drive me crazy with the huge change in volume that comes with one unit of volume increase/decrease.  I use this to adjust radio volume through headphones in a more useful way.  All is well.,5
"I often buy headphones with built-in volume control.  But the brand and style I really like is no longer available.  I discovered this in-line volume control, realized it would work with any standard headphones using a 1/8 inch plug and I couldn't be happier.  If I need extra cord length for my phones, this gives it.  And I will always prefer a hardware volume control to a software one.  It's just so much quicker and easier to deal with.",5
"I bought this and used it for a few weeks before it just died. No reason, no drops or bumps. It just quit working. I requested a replacement, because I really liked it while it worked. The returns process was quite easy and I didn't have to pay to ship it back. Overall, still a positive experience.",4
"Bought this because my earphones had no in-line volume. It does what is says it will. My one complaint was that is can only decrease the volume, not increase it.",4
"I use it with Zoom H1 portable recorder, I had a serious issue with Zoom that its intake level is VERY HOT!. So whne you get a line out from a mixer, you have no way to control the input gain! This is perfect for that. also it is Very clean sound !",5
"Definitely worth getting. Comes in handy when you can't control the volume what you're listening to, as you would expect.",5
Works great.  Can't say much else about this product other than write filler words so I can hit the submit button (got it).,5
"What can one say about this simple, but much needed accessory??-KOSS VC20 volume control-best one I have ever used.Ever use an accessory rotary volume control (if you can find one)??They usually work for a week, get a speck of dust inside, then become choppy or silent!Most headphones are furnished with a rotary volume control,the better headsets, of course, usually have the better quality control.However the controls drop dead, just before the headphones do....I mow acres & acres of lawns all season long-lots of dust & pollen.I use the KOSS VC20 every day (going on two years)!!If it gets dirty, a tiny squirt of Deoxit-and it springs right back!!!Amazing durability from an $8.19 component!",5
"for my use it's perfect. I just have my speaker set to the max volume (because its broken) and i control my volume with this, i love it although that shipping thing threw me off. $13 ... -.- would have liked to know from the start thank you very much.",4
"this item is an inexpensive handy item to adjust the volume on your IPod, etc without using the control of the IPod.However, this is not an amplifier, but a vclume control only",3
When I plugged in my stereo headphones I got nothing.  I found I had to pull the plug out about half way and jiggle it around to make any contact.  Then I got mono sound.  Think someone installed the wrong jack during manufacture.  Got a different brand elsewhere that works fine.,1
"Wonderful, very useful! My old portable radio and hardly responds to the volume control and I have returned to this attachment to use with headphones and volume control again.",5
"This product does what it is supposed to do.  I've occasionally noticed that the connection isn't perfect, but mine's been banged around a lot and dragged on the floor of my study.  I've always been able to get rid of any connection problems by just ensuring that the my phones are plugged in tight. This product comes in handy.",4
I used this to control the volume of a 2.1 speaker system.  however it does not control it properly.  The sound gets switched between speakers sometimes.. other times it just does not reduce the volume.  Havent tried it with a headphone though.,2
"As the night wore on the FM became static ridden.  I followed earlier reviews, popped the cover (3 screws) and counter-rotated the VR2 about 1/4th turn.  The signal improved dynamically and the static was gone!",5
Feels pretty darn cheap and the cable is frighteningly thin but I have had this thing for years and have not been particularly nice to it and it still works.,3
"It's a good unit and does what it's supposed to do, but the sound passing through loses some quality. Seems slightly distorted or missing some of the sound ranges.",4
"The Koss VC20 volume control works very well. At very low volume ((I would say less than 5% of max.) it gives sound only in the left canal, but that's really not a problem. I didn't notice any sound distortion otherwise.It has a small metal clip which can be &#34;removed&#34; (i.e. torn off) for the users who might find it problematic.",5
Just exactly what I was looking for. Satellite box audio output was un-adjustable and very loud. This fixed the problem.,5
"Does exactly what it should. I use it with a Blue Tooth receiver to work as wireless headphones with a set of ear buds. No noise on changing volume levels, long lasting (wear at night, so subject to toss and turn). The variable resistor must be of some quality in that it hasn't started making noise yet. (most cheap volume controls (potentiometers), start making noise after a short while).",5
"I already have two ""no name"" inline volume controls, but I needed another.  This Koss unit was no more expensive from Amazon than another ""no name"" from an electronics store, and I've been a big fan of Koss since the late 70s, so I bought it.First, what it IS and ISN'T.  This is a volume control, but NOT an amplifier.  It will make your MP3 player, etc., quieter, but NOT louder.  If your source is too quiet, look for a headphone amplifier.When I used to listen to a cassette walkman it was easy to turn down the volume when I needed to.  The volume control was a thumbwheel right on the player.  I have several MP3 players now, and they all have hi-tech context sensitive controls.  This means (for me, anyway) that I have to look at the screen to make sure the button or slide control is set for volume.  This control solves that problem.  Set the player for a volume slightly on the loud side and use the inline control to get comfortable sound.  If you need to lower the volume (to talk to someone, for instance) you can use the volume control without taking your player out of your pocket.This model has a three foot cord between the player and the volume control.  This is nice if your player has an FM tuner -- MP3 players use the headphone cord as an FM antenna.  My generic ones were only about 8 inches long and the FM reception suffered.The control has a clip on it, so you can wear your player safely in a padded pouch on your belt and clip the volume control to your chest pocket.A few reviewers have noted that lowering the volume attenuates high frequencies.  I tried using the EQ settings on my player (I was also using Koss PortaPro headphones).  When I had Bass Boost EQ settings I did notice some high frequency attenuation in both the Koss and generic inline volume controls; when the EQ was turned off I didn't notice as much high frequency attenuation, but the sound was very ""flat.""  Anyway, I don't think I would have noticed it if other reviewers hadn't pointed it out.An inline volume control is very handy for portable MP3 players, etc., and this unit is well thought out, and works great.",5
"It worked quite nicely for a few months, but then the sound started cutting out.Will buy again, as it is the only product I've found to add in-line volume control to headphones for any device, not just iPhones (which I don't have or like) Also, $10 2-3 times a year is definitely worth the convenience in my mind",3
"This is something you probably won't fully appreciate until you've had one for a while and then lose it. You may not need a headphone extension cord with an inline volume control. But once you get used to having one, you'll find the convenience and functionality are habit forming. The one I lost was in daily use for 3 or 4 years and continued to work well.",5
"I bought this to hopefully remove a very audible hissing sound from an HTC EVO V phone.  The hiss could be heard easily when I was playing mp3 files regardless of which pair of earbuds I used.  I inserted my earbud plug into the the Koss VC20 and then plugged the VC20 into my phone.  After turning the volume on my phone up and the volume on the VC20 down, I was thrilled to find that the hiss was no longer audible.  I noticed no degradation in sound quality (same bass and treble levels, for example) when using the VC20 versus not using it. The gadget is lightweight and offers excellent control over sound volume.  Well worth the price!!",5
This handy audio extension really helps while watching videos on the Kindle Fire. Offers an external volume control.Highly recommend this Koss unit to anyone who has noticed the modest volume output for the Kindle Fire. This is smaller than my earbuds when both are wrapped up.,5
"Does a good job at attenuating the sound out of my phone.  My Android has a bug where the media volume resets to max anytime a notification sounds.  This lets me set the media to max and then turn it down to comfortable.  I have very good earphones, and haven't noticed any sound issues.  The cord is flimsy feeling and quite long, so I've just kept it tied in a bundle.  We'll have to see about its longevity.",4
I listen to my TV once in a while using my bose QC15 headphones.  The problem with that set up is that volume cannot be adjusted and plays at full blast.  The Koss VC20 volume control module mitigated that issue.  Works as described.,5
"Koss should change the name of this unit to the Clarity Eliminator. That is exactly what it does when you try to turn the volume down. All the clarity / treble disappears leaving a barely understandable muffled sound. I tried it with brand new Koss UR40 headphones plugged into the tape monitor jack on a TDK dual tape deck. By themselves, the headphones have only fair quality and are way too loud. Add the VC20 and the muffled sound makes the headphones with volume control TOTALLY USELESS. If you need a volume control for headphones DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. Either buy some other one or buy headphones with a volume control, such as the Koss UR29.",1
"The connection between the headphones and the volume control doesn't seem to be too great. While adjusting the volume using the Koss Volume Control, one or both ear buds will stop working until I hit a &#34;sweet spot&#34; on the volume dial.",3
Feels and looks cheap.  It seems to work ok but sometimes you want a product for more than just functionality.  Its a little embarrassing using this ugly thing when I really like the look and feel of my headphones.,2
"This is a surprisingly useful gadget, as it serves as an extension cord and volume control. The extension cord aspect adds about 3 feet to your headphone, which gives me a lot more room to move when I am listening to music on my computer. The volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the player.",5
I use a radio to put me to sleep at night. I plug a pillow speaker into my radio or smartphone to listen to talk radio.It is a lot easier to control the volume with this that waking up my smart phone and using the volume control on it.,5
"My wife watches a lot more TV, often using headphones so that I can avoid the incessant prattle of TV. This allows her to control her earphones that are powered by the TV audio output.  (The audio output is always on, but doesn't have a volume control.)",5
"Economical way to make any headphones volume controllable. Works great and delivery was swift. Although it is compact, it seems sturdy enough to last for years.",5
"If you have audio equipment that doesn't have a volume control...for some odd reason, then this does the trick to fix that problem.",5
"If you want a buffer between you and the audio source, get this product. Well made and it will save your hearing.",5
"The Koss VC20 volume controller really does what it's suppose to. Not really much else to say about it, honestly.",5
"This product gets three stars for being the exact product I needed.  I couldn't find any other offerings for a headphone extension with potentiometer volume controls.  It loses two stars for how it crackled and had a poor connection almost as soon as I got it in the mail, due to a low quality cable that easily breaks inside.",3
"product works ok, but the tiny wheel volume control is difficult to turn, I have to use my finger nail to really turn it. Other than that I am happy with it.  Not really a professional volume controller, but it does the job, what do you want for such a cheap price ?",3
The sound is perfectly fine.  I couldn't tell any difference in quality when I had it connected directly or through this volume adjuster.  The cord eventually wore out after a lot of abuse.  I wish it was stronger.,4
"great item.  used for night time sleeping. operation by roller dial, easy and efficient item will buy a second for spare",5
"Using inline with my Sennheiser headphones. Control wheel in cavity of housing, so vol. control won't get accidently turned, and it stays where you set it. Good volume range easy to set to right level. Cord a bit long, when adding to my already long earphones cord, but I just coil up the volume control extra ! Good 1/8"" plug fit one end and strain relief on other end at cord. Getting another for my Koss headphones. Clip on it, to affix to like a belt.",5
"I have discovered, as have others, that most modern TVs do not have a simple output jack for headphones.  Instead they have a limited volume output set of jacks.  The sound coming out of them is set pretty low and you cannot increase it using your remote's volume controls (I guess the manufacturers figure you are going to hook it up to an amp and a theatre sound system, which is not what I wanted to do.)  So I heard about this product and it seemed like just the thing I needed to boost volume.  Wrong.  It has no power source, so if you set the dial on the unit at maximum volume, it comes to your headphones at exactly the same weak strength as emanates from the TV output jacks.  All it can do in reality is turn the sound down.  Skip it.",1
This product performs as advertised. I use it to connect a Bose Quiet Comfort headset to my computer for gaming and such to not annoy others nearby. Makes it much easier to control the volume with a physical wheel then through windows. Not much else to say about it.,5
It didn't take much use before the volume control stopped responding and the cord began shorting out the audio playback.,2
"I was hoping to get more volume from my tablet with an auxillary conrol, but that was not the case.  But, still a good product for extending the length of your speakers.",4
"I purchased this to hook up to my headphones that do not have a line level control. For its purpose it is fine.I am not an audiophile so I cannot comment on how good or bad the sound is. Seems fine to me but I have bad hearing anyway. The one I got did not have a curved jack as pictured but rather a straight one, no problem. I use this on my laptop and I have noticed that if I want to reach the louder setting I first have to turn my laptop up to one of the higher settings and then I can go up or down with the Koss. Overall I think it was a good purchase.",4
I got this because when we are recording music I dont like it loud in my eadphones and some time Freddy P wants it super loud in his ear.  This way we can both have it as loud or as low as we want.  Great deal.,4
I am using this volume control to operate the volume from a  satellite radio to one of the popular mini- mini speakers being sold which do not have volume controls.  Works just fine.,4
"So I loved the one I purchased for home so much that I purchased another for my headphones at work :) Simple, does what it says and a nice cheap price!",5
"Does what it says, works as expected. Cord and jack look a little spindly compared to everything else I have, but so far so good. Very small and light, making it highly portable if you need it to be. About 30"" of reach. I've only had this for a week or so; well worth the $7 as long as it survives a respectable lifespan.UPDATEI can't remember how long I got out of this, but it wasn't long enough (a few months). I really like inline volume controls, but will choose a different one next time. This unit got touchy and created buzzing. Look for something with better quality cable/shielding.",2
"A good little tool to have around the house, especially when gaming. I can plug this into the computer then my headphones into it, then adjust the volume from there without having to alt-tab to change the volume.",5
I use it at work where I use in-ear earphones and this is very handy to lower the volume quickly when someone is talking to me. Very useful.,4
Not sturdy but has lasted a year so far without problems. Even the cheapie in-line volume control has not created any noise problems. The price is right and this extension can be used with any headset. I think Koss will replace the cord free if it goes bad.,4
"The cable feels cheap and it is a thinner cable, but so far I've had no issues. The volume control is good, there is no hiss or distortion when adjusting volume. I'm rather picky with audio and I haven't had any issues, there is no interference or sound distortion that I can tell. I highly recommend it.",5
I have a sole elliptical that has built in speakers and an input for 3.5mm stereo plug.  It does not however have a built in audio control.  Running straight from my Roku player to the elliptical was too loud and from the tv too low.  This works perfectly connecting my Roku player to the elliptical now that I can control the volume.,5
"The volume control dial is way too small and Ina depressed area making it hard to use.  Also, it seemed to have trouble controlling the volume as 2/3rds of the dial did nothing and all the volume control was in the last 1/3rd.",1
"It is cheap!... I know :)It's ok, works as expected... just don't think it's going to last long, 'cause seems like cheap, light plastic-constructed.",3
"Koss VC20 Volume Control unit. Does exactly what it says it does, exactly as it expected. No more, no less.",5
"One of the first things I do when I'm buying new ear buds is check the cord length.  The majority of ear buds these days have cords that are much too short for everyday use often resulting in the ear buds pulling out of your ears or the cord coming unplugged from whatever device you're using.  This is where an extension cord/device such as this one is very useful.  Like many people, I sit at a desk in front of a computer all day, listening to music much of that time.  The iPod dock that I have on desk is just far enough away that my ear buds don't quite reach and wearing them isn't practical or comfortable.  Thus I purchased this item to add some cord length and some extra volume control.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Adds approximately 3' in cord length.+ Volume control switch is at the end of the cord and has a clip to attach to whatever you're wearing or carrying.Cons- Sound degradation is extremely noticeable.  Feels approximately like a 30-40% loss of sound because of the extended connection.  While I expected some loss I didn't expect quite this much.  The Volume switch barely raises the overall volume unless you have your device volume at max.- Flimsy wiring and weak connections tend to short out quickly if there is moderate or active use.- Amazon's stock photo doesn't exactly match the item I received.  My model matches the customer image that was submitted so there are slight differences such as the angle of the male end of the plug.  Could be problematic for some.While this item is useful to me in my particular situation I'd rate it poor overall.  It works for me because it will stay at work on my desk and not see any travel use.  Since I don't listen to my music very loud at work as I need to hear if coworkers are speaking to me, the low volume isn't a huge issue for me.  However, if you're looking to purchase an extension for your normal headphones to carry with you this is NOT the device for you.  Especially if you're going to be around a lot of noise or people talking (i.e. the bus, train, subway etc.).  If you're going to be in any of those situations you're better off going with a different product.",3
"This Koss VC20 In line Volume Control which I ordered along with a set of Koss headphones from the same seller were terrible-in my opinion! First off,the volume control ""know"" is so inset and tiny that I couln't even identify it at first for about 20 mminutes. It's difficult to ""thumbnail"" this volume control to raise and lower the volume. Also, I was unable to mute out the sound.I felt that the range of volume was inferior that it afforded me the opportunity to listen to. I DID follow instructions about where to put the sources volume (such as mid to just above middle range).",1
Made listening on the head phones much more comfortable and convenient.It is a good addition to the purchase of head phones,4
I have owned two of these.  I love the product till it stops working which it will.  Mine lasted longer than the 90 day warranty but both died within a year.  The wires start cutting out without any noticeable exterior damage.,3
"This item works very well and gives provides convenient volume control for headphones, portable speakers, IPODs, etc.  Easy to use, I highly recommend them.",5
"Did most of what I wanted... gave me easy to access volume control while I was snowboarding. On the other hand, as soon as I took a tumble the tiny fragile little metal clip bent way out of shape. A good thick one wouldn't have done that. I'm knocking off a star for that, since this isn't completely ideal for someone using this for a sports purpose. Aside from that, it does work pretty well.",4
I use this to ad a volume control to my headphones for my computer. It works. What more can I say.,4
"I have a number of headphones that for some reason have no inline volume control.  Of course, I can always dig my IPod out of my pocket or backpack, but it's not always easy, like this device, which clips to pocket of belt.Now I move this minimally priced add-on from headset to headset and wear the pair most comfortable for the situation.",4
"This is a handy and inexpensive little device.  A convenient way to ""tweak"" your volume level.  Works fine. No complaints.  Like all headphone cables it doesn't like to be rolled over by chair rollers, stomped on or yanked out of the socket.  If you treat it with moderate care, it ought to last for years.",5
"Volume control dial is a little small.  Probably makes so it doesn't adjust in you pocket, however if you have large hands this may be difficult to adjust.  Worked as expected, at $8, I thought it was a little overpriced.  However now I am able to control my audio volume from TV to my Headset,",4
This Koss is very good one for volume control. There is no noise sound when I adjust volume. I can't distinguish whether I plug my headphone with this Koss because it has no effect to my head phone at all. I use HD555 which has 50 ohms impedance so I think this Koss may reduce some power of my headphone. But not at all. My HD555 still provides great sound. I love it.,5
"Nice product.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Quality is great, but it does not have any type of pause button on it.  It is strictly a volume control only.",5
"My needs were simple, to lengthen the audio cord so I didn't have to worry about how i sat at work, and volume control.  I sit at the computer a bit from time to time, and like to stream music.The cord is long enough, about 3ft I believe.  The volume control is just that, basically it will not get louder than what the source is putting out, but it means I can adjust it, rather than adjusting the volume on the computer.It does everything it is supposed to, and in a small package.  Worth the purchase.",5
".I use my new Koss ""Remote Volume Control"" on my desktop computer, in line with my powered speakers.Remanufactured Harman Kardon HK595 2.1 Computer SpeakersWhen I'm at the computer, I always have it playing something -- streaming music, news, National Petroleum Radio, whatever.  And the computer has a dozen ""virtual"" volume controls -- Winamp has a few volume controls; Windows has even a few more for adjusting the volume.  Why should I add the Koss?Pros:But, nothing compares in convenience to being able to reach out to a physical Volume Knob laying on the desk.  No mousing required.  Faster than a mouse or keyboard control.In fact, my keyboard has a dedicated volume control on it, which I used to be impressed by.  But it works through Windows, so sometimes its action is delayed after I hit it, and then it starts moving at some arbitrary speed when I hold the button down.  So it's a minor challenge to make quick, delicate adjustments.The tiny knob in the Koss has a silky feel to it.  I'll let you know in a few decades if the physical control ever gets dirty and scratchy.At the Loud end of its adjustment range, the control is very gentle and smooth.  So if you turn the Koss to maximum volume, and adjust all your virtual volume controls so the audio is just a bit loud, then it's easy to use the Koss to cut back the volume slightly and make very delicate adjustments around the desired volume setting.  Of course, the Koss can also reduce the volume to Zero, smoothly.Amazon published another review, the Koss' ""Most Critical Review,"" where the reviewer observed that the audio got muddy when the volume control was turned down to its lowest settings.  I wouldn't use it at the lowest settings, anyway, because else you're going to blow your ears off if you turn the Koss up towards the high end of its adjustment range.  Anyway, it seems clear to me that the other reviewer tried compensating for the Koss being turned to the low end by turning up other volume controls in his system so that he could hear the audio, and one of those other volume controls was causing distortion.  I.e., it wasn't the Koss at fault for causing the muddiness, and his 1-out-of-5 star review is erroneous.  I can confirm that there is no fidelity change when the control is turned towards its Low end.Cons:There's a clip on the Koss, so you can attach it to your shirt or short-sleeve and use it while you walk your mp3 and your dog.  The wire is plenty long enough for that (my wire is about 2 1/2 feet long), but if your desktop computer isn't located on your desktop, the wire might not be long enough for you to reach the volume control -- not unless you add an audio extension cable.  And you know, adding more audio plugs and sockets threatens to make more scratchy connections.The wire itself is thin.  We're talking the type of wire that has a few wisps of copper for the audio, a few more wisps for the ground, all inside a 1/16 inch diameter plastic sheath.  If I treat it gently, it will last a while on my desktop.  If I were to take it jogging and toss it around thoughtlessly, it wouldn't last a year.  Thinking of opening up the housing (which is glued shut) and re-soldering the connection?  Those wisps of copper and their tiny connections are very difficult to work with; good luck.Another reviewer mentions that he buys one of these periodically.  He blames himself because the wire breaks, periodically.  I think some blame should be reserved for the delicate design of a product whose function it is to be used on the run.",4
"Not much to write, this is a great addition for those headphones which don't have their own volume control and you don't want to mess with the Windows volume or your music player volume.I just put them on high and control the volume through this instead.Recommended.",5
"This does the task it is supposed to do. It provides an inline volume control for headsets that do not have one. I realize that many headsets are available that have this built in. However, we have several nice pair of headsets without this feature. Rather than replacing expensive headsets, I bought this to make it easier for me to change the volume without fiddling with controls on the computer or ipod.",5
"I ride a scooter (aka Vespa) and it is inconvenient to reach the volume control of my mp3 player while I'm riding, so I decided to buy this and so far I'm pleased. I love how I can clip it on my shirt and easily access it. One thing to mention is that it does not amplify sound so it will only go as loud as the music player can go. I believe there is no degradation in sound quality so that is great. Overall I'd recommend it based on my experience.",5
"I'm using this with a set of Cambridge Soundworks 2.1 speakers since the original volume control stopped working and they no longer sell replacements.The cable is thin, and of decent length, but it is not that robust, so I don't know how much abuse it can take.I don't know what the circuitry is in on the inside, but for my speakers, I have to have the knob at a very low setting, otherwise the sound volume gets outrageously loud.  As a result, unless I have it above a certain level, I only get sound at the appropriate sound level from one channel.  If I increase the volume, then both channels sound fine.  So that is slightly irritating, but other than that, works well.",3
"I bought this volume control for sports activities. Big mistake, it lasted for less than three months, the cable connection to the volume control is broken. The potentiometer that adjusts the volume is a piece of crap too. Don't buy this product for sports use.",1
A gadget that is nice to have. Gives an extra length for extension. Some static noise when adjusting the volume.,3
"An inline volume control is a great idea - we've used Sony headphones in the past that offered this, but the headphone quality was poor.  When I saw the Koss Volume control, I was happy I could get back the control, while still using my high quality 'phones.Unfortunately, the max volume with the Koss installed is diminished quite a bit.  I'd say about 20% lower than regular headphones alone.Another issue is the small size of the slider - I find myself fumbling to find the slider and use it.  Something with a bit more of a 'thumb switch' would be better.  I understand you don't want something that can be easily bumped accidentally, but the tiny slider bar this unit currently has is just not adequate.Because there's no other options I've found for something like this, I'll stick with the Koss Volume control, but if there were other options, I'd jump in an instant!",2
"These things are always temporary. Fortunately my new receiver has a better earphone output, complete with volume control on the TV remote, so I don't need to replace this in-line volume control.Nothing wrong with the product, but it wasn't sturdy enough to really last - and nothing else I've tried was either. The designers apparently have never lived with their own products. If they listen to music or TV at all they probably don't use earphones.Review by Tony. We both use Plant Lady's Amazon account these days. She has never used earphones and knows nothing about the highly technical science of running them off a TV set.",3
"I just needed an extension cable for my Sony headphones that had very short wire length (they connect to my cell phone's hands free cable and that's why they have been made that way), but most of the extensions available are at least 3ft in length. This Koss VC20 was perfect and I also got the added convenience of a volume control. However, at $8.99 (what I paid at the time) they are pricey for what they do. These days you can pretty much buy a cassette/CD walkman for that price!Nevertheless, I am happy with my purchase.",4
"I have had them before. So I knew what I was getting. It is hard to find these at Walmart or even better, Radio Shack.",4
"When you set the volume on your music player, it goes in steps and is hard to get the loudness you want. This helps fine tune your volume to the exact spot you want it! I really recommend this so you can get the volume you want.",5
Worked just fine but someone stepped on it and it easily broke.  I may get another one though.  It is very inexpense.,3
"only worked for a short time about 2 1/2 mouths then one side or the other on the headphones kept going off I had to keep playing with it to get it to somewhat work ,  I got 3 of these and the same thing keeps happening.  it is very hard to find a good volume control.",1
I like good quality in the ear speakers but not all of them have the volume control on the wire leads. I bought a set of Klipsch in the ear speakers with no volume control. Having the inline control is a must for me because I wear them under my ear muff hearing protection when shooting pistol at the conservation club I belong to. So with the noise canceling ear speakers and the hearing protection muffs I need to turn the volume down without pulling out my smart phone when  someone is trying to talk to me. They work well and I cannot hear any difference if the ear speakers are directly plugged into my music source or if they are going through the volume control. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for an in line volume control device.,5
The volume control works as described and is well made.  The only complaint I have is with the long cord.  If you need to control the volume of your device at a distance this is the control you should buy.  Otherwise you will find yourself winding up the excess wire.,4
"The view shows a 90 degree jack but the actual product is a normal straight on jack. The normal straight on jack will have stress on it. I bought this because my RCA HDTV has a headphone buzz, probably due to proximity to the the light source. If I had it to do over again I would get an LED HDTV back light. Much less chance of buzzing.",3
Nothing serious. The volume seems no different from when I control it via my phone. The only difference noted is the ability to leave my phone in my pocket. Not impressed at all.,3
"I'm using this item in line for a set of wired headphones for a TV. The output from the TV is fixed so I needed to have a volume control in line so I could turn down the volume on the TV so I could watch and leave the room quite. This control gave me a couple more feet of length and it works flawlessly. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. I'm using the same headphones I use with my iPod.Addendum: I've had my volume control for a year now; and it continues to work very well. I use it everyday, and I've had no problems with it. I saw one reviewer that complained it was hard to use; I can't imagine how that could be. The control wheel is recessed into the unit, but is easy to use by just sliding your thumb over the wheel. I've found it to be very robust; once it attached to the end of my headphones the unit reaches to floor; but it's well made, and has taken a beating with any problems.",5
i got it because of the l shaped plug in but when it got here it was just the old plain straight plug in,1
"If you use any sort of earphones or earbuds, and you need to extend the length of the cord, and at the same time also control the volume, this little device is something you can use.  A true audiophile might have some issue with it, but for general use, this works like a charm.  I use one between my computer and my headphones, and it sounds great on games and music alike.  I also use one between my earbuds and mp3 player, again, I cannot complain.  Very cost effective and hard to find something better.  Note, this will NOT amplify the sound beyond the volume of the source, but can control it within the range of the signal being sent.",4
"These external headphone or ear bud volume controls are dificult to find.  This one works very well. Wide range of volume control. Note that miniplug is straigt and not angled as shown in photo of product.  Actually I wanted the straight plug.  Only wish that the small pocket clip was removeable.  Minor detail, however.",5
"While not the use most likely intended for this Koss device, I purchased it for my mom so she could control the sound from her TV whether to a pair of headphones or a small powered speaker in her lap. It's perfect, and allows her to keep her own personal volume while not having the TV set itself so loud as to blast out the rest of the room. I have also tried it on my iPod, and it's a much more convenient way to trim the volume than fumbling for the touch screen or wheel. I believe the claims on the box to &#34;boost the volume&#34; of your personal device may be less than accurate, at least in my case, but it certainly works well enough for the obvious purpose.",5
Bought this for my brother to use on his motorcycle speaker system and it works really good. For this price you can't go wrong with this.,4
"Trivial setup, just put it between your headphones and whatever they were plugged into already. Works, although I agree with others who have mentioned that the thumbwheel is pretty small.",4
"Very good volume controller and very useful, have it on my PC works with any head phones, does the job it was made for and works great.",5
I got the Koss volume control mainly because I listen to books when I walk and the traffic often makes it difficult to hear.  Being able to just adjust the volume with the Koss volume control is much easier than pulling out my Ipod or MP3 player to do it.  It also conserves the battery by not having to adjust it on the player.  This works exactly like it is advertised.,5
I purchased this volume control simply to give my headphones an extension cord.  Being able to adjust the volume is an added bonus.,5
"I have a very nice set of stereo headphones which, for reasons I cannot understand, does not include an in-line volume control.  I purchased the Koss VC20 to insert in the playback circuit when I needed an in-line volume control.  The device works perfectly, just as it is supposed to.  The only minor drawback is that the notched wheel with which you change the volume setting is rather small and quite sensitive - only a potential disadvantage for folks with large fingers.  Overall, I'm totally satisfied with this product.",5
"After less than a month of being attached to my laptop, the volume control started introducing static, and suddenly it was as if the control was turned all the way down, no matter what I did with the volume wheel.",1
"I think every pair of headphones should have built-in volume control, but a lot of them don't, so this bit of kit is needed.  They work just as expected with no degradation to the sound quality.",5
This volume control is just what I needed to control the volume for headphones I own without a volumecontrol.  The control is simple and the volume changing is continuous and smooth.,5
"I have bought two of these, one for myself and another for a gift.  I like having the thumb wheel volume control handy to raise and lower volume while watching movies on my pad.  It is a very solid product!",5
"This product has been mediocre since the beginning.  When adjusting the volume control, the balance alternately shifts between favoring the right and left channels in an unpredictable manner.  After just a couple of months of use, there is a great deal of static and crackling when changing the volume.  Sometimes rapidly turning the dial from MIN to MAX several times alleviates the problem for a few hours.  This product is good if you're looking for an inexpensive, throw-away solution.",3
"Developed a short in the jack after 2 uses.  Sound was fine until then, now its a constant struggle to get the plug situated so that there is no static.",2
"Im very happy with this extention. Not only does it giveme the extra length to use it for remote viewing thru my PC from bed, it is very convenient for volume I have complete Privacy and Control of my utube and Netflix viewing late at night, I wasnt sure but it turned out to be a Great Buy.",5
"It works as advertised, it's nice and small and adds a little length to your existing headphone cord. Mine doesn't look exactly like the one pictured (it's more squared off than rounded) but no big deal, I'm still pleased with it and do recommend it.",5
"This on-line volume control works good, no issues so far. I recommend it for anyone that owns headphones lacking volume control.",4
"This product works fine, but when I tag it along with my JVC headphone, the combined wire length becomes unmanageable.",3
Does what it is supposed to do. Only criticism is the volume control knob is a little small.,4
"I needed this to adjust the volume while snowboarding and wasn't able to remove my gloves while on the mountain to mess with the ipod, and this did the trick. Its also good as an cord extension. No reduction in sound quality and it definitely took in some snow, but still performs just fine.",4
This works great. I have a MP3 player that I use when I am riding and it makes it easier to adjust the volume. Fast shipping.,5
I have a Koss Headphone but leaning back in my chair was not quite long enough plus the volume control is very handy to make a quick volume control when needing to make quick volume controls as well as getting some more space.  The quality is very good with the headset and volume control.,5
It's so convenient having a volume control for my earphones.  I use this when watching my TV since there is no volume control for the earphone connection.  I may order another one for use with my iPod so I won't have to dig it out of my purse to adjust the volume.,5
"This is a great companion to my JVC noise cancelling headphones.  I don't really need the extra length while traveling, but at home the added range and direct volume control is a big plus.",4
"I used this for my Father so he could control his pillow speaker control, which has no volume control. It's been working perfectly for about a year now.",4
I like it BUT it has a 3 foot cord.  Add that to the 3 foot cord from my headset and I am dragging around 6 foot of cord.  I have quit using it because I catch it on so many things.  I will be looking for a shorter cord for the headset.  It would have been nice if the cord was removable. I don't really want to replace my headset cord and finding a shorter replacement that will fit my JVC headset is turning out to be a challenge.,4
"My niece who lives with me loves to play video games, but we have wood floor throughout the house. This causes the noise from the video games to echo throughout the house. So I bought a RCA to 3.5 mm cable and hooked up headphones not realizing that I needed something to control the volume with. This is where this KOSS VC20 volume control comes into play it worked wonders for my TV (which is older and did have the RCA AUDIO OUT).One thing to note is most of the modern TV do NOT have an RCA audio out instead they have Digital Optical Audio Toslink output. This means you would have to get an adapter that takes the signal from Analog to Digital and back.",4
"The volume control degraded the sound quality significantly. If you use it with a cheap earphone, it may be OK for you, definitely not enevn with Koss PortaPro or KSC75.",2
"I use this with my Bluetooth headphones the volume control is great which Is what looking for in this product, the extra cable length is a bonus.",5
"If you're using this for headphones, it's probably fine. I was trying to use it as a replacement volume puck for amplified speakers, and the cable is so poorly insulated that all sorts of noise comes through. The volume control is nice and it is very small.",3
"This is yet another case of the product delivered being somewhat different than the product image, which is not agreeable in principle of making an online purchase. The product I reviews has a slightly different casing that the image and also the wording is not white but grey. My problem is that in this case I feel with this image the seller is trying to give a somewhat skewed image on the device.For one, the 3.5mm male connection(going into your device that is producing sound) is not a right angle connector. This can be a issue for some users since depending on their intended usage a straight connection can cause undue torquing on the 3.5mm port potentially causing damage to either the connector or the jack on the device itself. To balance this somewhat the 3.5mm cable is flexible and the jack is fairly small in comparison to some straight jacks that are larger and stick out quite far.Secondly, the metal clip that is supposed to attach the device to a shirt, pocket, ect.(which is not shown in the product image) is really cheap so does not hold fast to whatever you try to clip it on.Lastly, the volume control it recessed into the chassis so it only protrudes slightly. This can be taken as a positive or a negative depending on your perspective. On the positive you will not have any issue with the volume control breaking or the volume being altered unintentionally. However because of this, altering the volume can take slightly more deliberate effort than usual. It also means that it might be uncomfortable for those of you with larger fingers. This again has to do with your preference and how you change the volume(either with the tip of your finger close to the nail or with the flat of the tip of your finger.)Overall I would have preferred the item been closer to $5 than the $10 it costs, but I was in a hurry(which I rarely ever am when it comes to electronics). So keep what I said in mind and look around for something that might fit you better before deciding. That is unless you were like me and just need an inline volume controller quickly and without hassle.ADDITIONI noticed this a while ago buy forgot to add it to my review, when changing the volume the sound to the headphones(or whatever device is connected)is changed so that the volume in one ear becomes louder than the other. It happens when the volume is only changed slightly so only another minor move is required to bring the sound back to normal but it is noticeable.",4
"The cable is thin, but appears to be a high quality. Connectors are well built.The volume control is easy to use, and will let you fine tune the volume to any lower volume.",5
I love having a volume switch available no matter what headphones I use.  Also the cord is long enough to work as an extension. I've always enjoyed Koss products; the quality of sound from their headphones just sounds better to me than most-- especially for the price.,5
"This is more accurately called a Volume Limiter.  It can only decrease volume and cannot increase the volume from your device.  This is a very simple device that acts as a throttle on the volume provided by the output of your device.  It connects to the output of your device (an earphone jack) and then provides a connection for earphones or speakers.  Once the connection is made the in-line rheostat can reduce the volume.It does that very well and does not seem to add any static.  The controller operates smoothly up and down.  I use this between my laptop and an amplified set of speakers.  I set my laptop to 70% output and the amplifier to 70% which turns out to be very loud with the controller in the max position.  I then use the controller to reduce and increase volume without having to touch the laptop or the amplifier.when connected to my phone, I set the volume to high and reduce it as needed with the controller.  It saves having to activate the screen and taking the phone in and out of my pocket.  It is very handy and the extra cord length is handy for short corded earphones.",5
Have used item very little but pleased with it. I would recommend to anyone with need of such a device.,5
My portable XM radio was over driving the amp in my truck no matter how I adjusted it. Installed this product in line with the radio output and problem solved and for almost nothing.,4
This year I bought a Dell Vostro laptop. It turns out that many/all have a problem with the audio in that there is a buzzing sound and noise  especially when using earbud headphones. Someone suggested using a volume control to increase the impedence. I didn't expect it to work but it does. The Koss VC20 reduced the problem to the point where it is barely perceptable. I am completely satisfied.,5
Used for under the pillow stereo speaker. Also added a small headphone amplifier between this volume control and audio source. Would recommend.,5
"Please note, this will not make your music louder. It will simply control the volume - that's it.  Now that I've said this, let's move on.I love this little device.  It works great with my Samsung S3 and Poweramp app. Sometimes I get tired of taking my Samsung in an out of my pocket just to adjust the volume - as there are some songs a bit louder than others like there are some commercials on tv that are louder than others. Well, I don't have to do that any longer. I have the Koss Volume Control clipped on the wire part of my Sony headphones and I'm good to go. I owned one before but I must have lost it during relocating and I was really missing it.(I will update this review if any problems arise from this device).",5
"PortaPro headphones did not dissapoint.  Sound was good, and a good alternative to in ear headphones.",4
"I bought these headphones because they collapsed into a portable state. Unfortunately the bag, though of very nice material, was not at all big enough to enable me to store the phones in it. The whole experience of trying to fit the collapsed phones into the bag was quite frustrating and I'm surprised that an otherwise good sounding pair as these were (but not great) would be matched with such an unsatisfactory bag as far as size is concerned. However, I did lol use the bag for other things and was very happy with the bag in this case.I found the sound quality not up to the past reviews which gave the PortaPros such a great reputation though.",3
Well this product has absolutely exceeded my expectations in terms of the overall sound quality .. . And for the price that its offered. . .i can recommend any one to just buy it .. without thinking twice. ..Cons :  Not as comfortable as over the ear headphones. ..,5
"I had a Koss CD player when I was little, and the bass was unmatched in a bookshelf system.  It made me the envy of my friends and translated into loyalty with KOSS headphones.  I can't say enough about these lightweight, gorgeous-sounding, funky headphones.  PortaPros have a lifetime warranty, look like something out of Tron, and spoil the listener with comfort and bass reproduction.  Buy 'em, and find something else to worry about, in life.  Highly recommended.",5
"I'm on my second pair of these headphones. I'm no audiophile - just a gym rat who uses them every day to drive my workouts.Considering the class of headphones under $50 that I have used, for this one:The Good features:  great sound, light on head, excellent bang for the buck.The Bad features:  I carry them in my gym bag along with my other stuff. The cord gets tangled up half the time.  Also, after some time (1-2 years) the ear cushions become shredded, and must be replaced.June 22, 2012 update.  I have purchased another pair, and I'm very impressed. (New headphones needed since the previous pair would intermittently drop the signal.)  The cord seems shorter, and it is thicker so it only gets a little tangled. Also the ear muffins appear larger.  For the price, I know of nothing that's better.  A great buy.",5
"These headphones have been the companion to my laptop since the day I bought them. They are small, light, and deliver surprisingly good sound for the size.On the negative size, the foam ear pads can fall off very easily, and have a relatively short life. The sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touch.",4
"I purchased these headphones looking for a set of sub-100 dollar on-ear phones.  Like many other reviews say, the sound quality is superb for the price range.  my only complaint is the comfort.  i don't wear them on a daily basis, and they are slightly difficult to get accustomed to.  other than that, this is a top notch product.",4
"Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings. Nice price",4
"There are enough reviews here to keep you busy for a few hours, so I will only mention a few points:1) I had the Sportapros. They sound great, too (same drivers), but the Portapros are really worth the extra $13 or so bucks you'll spend on them. The PPs are much more robust, and look better IMHO. Just spend the extra cash, you won't be disappointed.2) No questions asked lifetime warranty.3) They sound FANTASTIC for most of us average joe's who love music, and tend to boost bass and treble on EQs.They are worth every penny!",5
"I was little skeptical about buying this one. Portapros are produced all the way since the 80s and have a flimsy look. My doubts continued as I was unpacking my Portapros. Could this little, flimsy, plastic set of headphones be that good? All of my doubts have evaporated once I have tried using them. These headphones have two big pros:1. Sound quality: One thing you should be aware of is that these headphones are _loud_. I have compared them to my Sennheiser HD201 and Sony MDR-A34. There is no comparison. Portapro is much louder. Of course, if you don't like it, you can turn down the volume. However, despite the loudness, the sound is excellent. I can pick a lot of details in my music CDs that were nearly undetected with the MDR-A34 and barely audible with the HD201. When I play first person shooter games, I am getting excellent directional sound.2. Comfort: The comfort is excellent. The headphones sit very tightly on my head and yet they don't apply much pressure to my ears. I can wear my Portapros for hours without feeling any discomfort. The reason for this, is that these headphones come with extra cushions the sit above your ears and shift some pressure to your head leaving very little pressure on ears. You can also choose how much pressure you want to have applied to your ears. If the default is too much, you can shift some of that pressure to the auxiliary cushions by changing the ""Comfort Zone""  settings (the blue buttons above the driver, it's best to start playing with them once you already wear the headphones). Since the headphones sit tight on your head, they're suitable for outdoor or gym use. The cable length is just right to reach your PC speaker or mp3 player (about 3 feet), but I suppose that some people will find it too short. Finally, the set folds easily and fits into a small leather bag provided for portability.And, have I mentioned lifetime warranty? If they ever break, just send them to Koss with a $6 check. They'll fix or replace them for you. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs cheap, reliable headphones with good sound quality for either indoor or outdoor use.",5
"You can't beat the sound quality for this price. It's good all-around for every type of music. Clean high and solid low. If you listen mainly to hip hop where booming bass is important, you might want to check out other makes. I listen to all types of music, so this is a good all-around headset for this purpose.It does look a little dorky, but sound quality is more important to me than looks. The headband does pinch your hair occasionally, if you're not careful adjusting it. Mine did not come with a case. It came with a soft pouch instead, so not a whole lot of protection there for traveling purposes. Even in the folding position, it's not easy to get it in the pouch. The sound does leak (enough to bother my wife as she's lying next to me in bed). The ear foams feel a little weak and may wear out quickly after frequent use. Don't know if you can buy the foam separately. I gave it 4 stars mainly for sound quality and price ($30-$40). I've had mine for about 2.5 years now and they still sound just as good as the various $100 plus headsets I recently listened to at the local Best Buy store.",4
Many of my friends look at these headphones and wonder why I make such a big deal about them. They are not the most beautiful headphones to look at. But do they kick xxx when it comes to sound there are not another pair it this price range that even comes close .,5
"I have a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 headphones which I bought a couple years ago use for listening to music, videos etc on my pc or sansa. However they were never really very suitable for jogging or biking in (not a tight enough fit and will come loose during excessive movement).The bud type earphones just don't cut it for me - uncomfortable and sound quality just crappy. I wonder why most other people are happy to wear bud type phones? Maybe my ears are deformed...Anyways, I googled the web and found several good review's of these koss phones for running.I bought a pair a couple of months ago and I must say that it's one of the best buys I have ever made.The sound quality of the Koss Portapro is excellent and slightly better than my Sennheiser PX 100's. They fit very snugly and feel very light when running and that plus the excellent sound quality make them a great buy.One feels very happy when you have paid a small amount of money for great quality and great sound.Now when I'm sitting at my pc and need phones for listening it becomes a bit more of a toss up. The Koss sound quality is great and with a snug fit. The Sennheiser PX 100 although not quite as good sound quality have a very light feel to them.For walking, running and  general moving around - these Koss phones are the way to go.May 2012 Update:These guys are holding up well despite some pretty rugged treatment - highly recommended",5
"I bought a pair of these while I was in New York - I bought them from one of the big camera/gear brokers there and paid about $35 for them. I bought them because my IEMs are too dangerous to wear on city streets and my AKG K271s are too big to wear out. So, these seemed like a happy medium. They're very durable, they have excellent bass for something this size, and they have a cool retro look. With the lifetime guarantee I'm comforted in the idea of getting them replaced if I should accidentally break them. So far so good though, 6+ months later.",5
"I've been using this headphone for a few months.For the build - It looked filmsy, but even I haven't been using it very carefully, it's still working well, no parts broken.For the sound quality, the bass is very good, mid-range is good. I hope the high range could be a bit clearer.  Meanwhile, I found that this headphone is quite musical, no harsh high range, and enjoyable to listen to, especially for piano music, easy listening, and jazz music.  Still the high range could be a bit improved; but, at this price range, it's very okay.",5
"Great audio with the headphones, nothing else needs to be said about that.But now that that's said, these headphones can be uncomfortable on larger melons. I find myself pulling them off and switching to my over the ear koss headphones because they don't feel like they're crushing my skull.Also, the cord is by far the WORST part about his set. The cable itself is a little too short for my tastes, about 4 feet. This means I feel tethered to my laptop often. But more importantly is the quality of the cord. The cord itself feels like a wire stuck in a narrow sheet of plastic. The reason that is important is because the wire holds its shape any time its folded or bent. This means that the pretty cool looking pair of headphones now have a cord is sometimes so bent out of shape that it rides up in my face.",4
"I usually use ear buds, or speakers, but I thought I would try these. The bass and the sound response in general are quite good. They are seemingly flimsy, or should I say, light weight, but I have been pretty hard on them and they are still in one piece. I would recommend them over similarly priced ear buds, so long as the style appeals to you.",5
"I've been using these headphones since 1996. I've owned many pairs but Koss has a no questions return policy, one time even sending me a new pair because I inquired about replacement ear pads. The sound that these cans put out are second to none. I flirted with Grado's and other expensive headphones but always run back to these. The look is very 80's retro because they are unchanged (by popular demand) since their introduction and they bring warm deep sound to anything you plug them into. Ear buds are for idiots. Step up to a pair of these babies and you'll be stoked at the sound they put out.",5
"I bought a pair of these.... over 20 years ago! They still work, and more important, sound fantastic! I've replaced the ear pads due to age, but that's it.What stands out about these today, just as it did back in the early 1980s is the true high fidelity sound quality - including true extended bass. From low bass through the highest treble, these are well balanced and natural sounding. More money will buy a headphone that excels in one area, but to truly outperform these overall is getting up there. To add more transparency to the musical reproduction is going to just plain cost you - and they will be a larger set.In closing, I misplaced my pair (since found) and spent $50 on a pair of well respected affordable AKGs. These sound better.Highly recommended!",5
"These are one of the best headphones that can be bought for the money!PROS- Great sound, I listen to Rock and Pop mp3 music mainly, and that sounds great! All friends who are accustomed to junk earphones that come with the iPods are just amazed when they listen through this!- Comfort! You just don't feel them on your head after some time.- Lifetime Warranty! I bought them at Amazon in 2004. Was having some troubles with one earpiece not working properly, and all the foams were gone. I got them repaired absolutely free (just paying the shipping costs), and that too in India! They are like new now.- Price! Bought them for $35 at amazon.- Portability is decent. They fold and don't take much space.CONS- Sound leaks. I use them at office, and cubicle mates sometimes tell me to lower the volume- Looks, as others have said, they definitely look awkward.Overall, unless you want earbuds/noise cancelling phones/audiophile quality, you cannot go wrong with these.",5
"I've been using these headphones for over a year now and they're simply excellent.I know some have an issue with the style, but all I really care about is the sound quality.It's terrific.",5
"These headphones are really great, unfortunately mine broke early on. The return policy calls for you to ship the items back to Koss + $9.00 shipping and handling. I stood up and literally tore the cables out. In my own defense, they're not secured in tightly. I still give the headphones four stars because I believe they're stylish and the sound is really great. They really fit a comfortable niche for those that do not want sound-isolation; and, they have a really strong ability to throw sounds and convince you that you have more than two sound channels.",4
"Stop looking and just get these. They don't feel as comfortable as some other headphones, but they sound great!I love the retro look too.",5
"I liked these headphones, pretty much what I paid for.  The metal band on the top grabs hair sometimes if you adjust it on your head... so just don't do that and you'll be good.Good sound, fairly comfortable.  Essentially just what I wanted.",4
"They are collapsible, comfortable, they have great sound quality (good bass), and they come with a lifetime warranty. How can you not buy these?",5
"follow-up comment, June 11, 2007I ended up sending one of the broken headsets back to Koss, along with a $6 check.  Turns out, these have a lifetime guarantee, and for $6, they will repair or replace them for you.  I got the new pair in rapid order-- total turn-around was about 10 days.  Caution--if you send these in for repair, do NOT include the pouch;  they returned only the headphones, without the pouch.  Anyway, it was really nice having the new headphones.  BUT, this morning, I picked them up to put into the little carry pouch I use for my Nano and headphones, and found that the left earpiece was dangling again, broken at the swivel point.I really like the comfort of these headphones and the fact that I don't have to crank up the volume to hear.  But, I am now actively looking for a replacement to use, as these are obviously too frail for the constant folding and unfolding they get for my commutes to and from work.  Sorry to have to do this, but I would change my 4 stars down to 3 (but Amazon is not letting that happen).If you will not be stuffing these in a storage pouch but will be simply laying them on a desk or table, then these are great.  If you plan to fold and open a lot, I now suggest you look for something more durable.Sorry, KOSS!------------origianal review Jan 6, 2007:Quality good enough to make me get  a 3rd pairI have gone through 1.5 pairs of these things, now (my current pair is nearly ready for replacement).  The first pair finally broke apart while folded in the soft bag that comes with it (I had had those about 6 or 7 years) -- I took them out and the left earpiece had broken at the plastic attach point and was left hanging.  My second pair is now only 2.5 years old (purchased April 2004), and the wire at the plug end is getting iffy.  If the wire moves, sometimes the phones go into single ear mode, so I guess one of the wires inside the very thin cable is breaking at the joint.  This plug has a right angle into the player, and it is right at the cord end of  the right angle piece where the wire is weakening.  I am going to try taping it here to keep it from moving, and see if that solves the problem temporarily.I do side by side test with this headphone and others used by other individuals.  I ask them to put the volume where it won't blow out my eardrums, then I listen using their phones and settings.  I then plug in my portapros, and listen.  So far, I have not found anyone's setup to beat  the quality and clairty and volume delivered by these phones.  Usually, I have to turn the player DOWN when I plug in my phones because they pick up so much more than others.If you are prepared to buy a new pair of these every 5 years or so, then these are definitely a good deal.I just wish Koss would send a hard case for storage since I do believe that the soft case does not protect them enough when they are stowed.  Koss could also thicken the cable a little bit to make it more durable, or do a gradual thickening as the cable nears the plug.  When I get a new pair, I will tape that end of the cable to try to postpone this problem -- less than 3 years is too soon for this to happen.Becasue of these two design flaws, I rate these a 4 intead of the 5 that the quality of sound delivers.I listen to jazz, smooth jazz, pop, rock, and audiobooks primarily.Happy listening!",4
"I bought the Sennheiser PX200 and returned them since they hurt my head (7 3/4 hat size). These headphones sound better, (better range and low end), fit better, and cover more of my ears.  Solid value.",5
"Most anywhere on the web you can find these for between $30 to $40 bucks and they are well worth it. I tend to be a bit of an audio snob but I'm using these on a cell phone and occasionally an Ipod. So I understand those aren't going to be able to push a lot of power in order to get a full range.Even with that being the case I was pleasently surprised with the efficiency of these. You don't have to turn them up very loud to get a full sound. Bass is very strong, it can be a little too strong at times depending on your musical taste. I listen to a wide range, from classical, to Hip-Hop and for things like Jazz and Classical I find that these struggle a little because the sound separation is okay, the highs are a little on the flat side and the bass can be a little imbalanced. This isn't to say they sound bad but for music demands with a high range then these aren't going to do as good as they would for something like Mos-Def for whom these are exceptional. The construction is pretty good though the design is very dated but I can live with that because I'm concerned about the sound it produces not how cute they are.If good sound is what your looking for at a great price just listen one time and you'll understand why they're considered classics. For a $30 price you can get $100 sound.",5
"Amazon just reminded me that I purchased these from Amazon in 2000.These PortaPro's used to be THE standard as the most comfortable and best sounding headphones for portable, PC and casual listening. You can't go wrong at the price point.On my Cowon IAudio U3 player (MUCH better audio, watts, than any crApple Ipus), where one can really hear the quality of audio. It has several audio formats that include the superior open source formats like the losless FLAC and the best lossy format, Ogg.I listen to different types of music, classical, classic rock, blues, progressive,  audio documentaries, audio books.I am one that really loves to listen to music that is distortion free as possible. I love clear, clean sounds that are natural where you can really pick out all instruments, little nuances in harmonies. Where quietness, silence in a song, will be totally quiet.I have that as good as the PortaPro's are, they give more of a distorted sound, especially with distortion at bass. I say this in compariason to Sennheiser Headphones and what I see as the best of breed, the Sennheiser PX100s.Someone called them ""livier"" than the PX100s, where I totally understand what they are referring too. The ""livier"" part is why I gave them to me son. That is distortion, especially at bass. I don't like distortion or over amplification that creates distortion.But if one prefers that heavier, distorted bass sound, which many do, these are the ones.They are SOOO comfortable, but then again so are the PX100s.I for one, couldn't care less what others think if they look cool, ugly, whatever. What is essential is the comfort and audio quality.If someone is really bothered because they are NOT in a style that is not currently marketed, then I feel the issue is withe the individual, not the headphones.They really are great and I see at 29.99, a great buy.OR ... if you want, you can pay of $100, and get some heavily marketed headphones that are more stylist, but will be a more more uncomfortable and probably not sound as good as the PortaPros or the PX100s.I also will tell you that I cannot stand the headphones that are made to drown out sound. For one, the headphones that do allow air SOUND BETTER. The headphones that totally cut out air and environmental sounds, literally  give me a headache.I too want to know if someone is trying to get my attention or if their is some kind of loud noise that I should be aware of.JonAs for me, I have my PortaPro's to my son several years ago.I love a listen to music that gives me the most distortionless",4
"The Koss Porta-Pro looks delicate, but its folding design belies a hardiness that competitors should try to emulate. All headphones require a ""burn-in"" period before they sound their best, and that's certainly true of the Koss Porta-Pro.After burn-in, they show themselves to be equal to their reputation. Retailing between $30 and $40 or so, they offer good fidelity at low to medium volume, but grate a bit when pushed too hard. The Porta-Pro works nicely with a variety of musical styles, pop and rock to jazz, but occasionally has trouble with the distortion levels of punk; this may not be a problem with most listeners.While the sound is clear and offers fine fidelity, songs often lack ""color"" -- a common complaint with less expensive headphones. Yet, compared to its competition, the Porta-Pro offers a much cleaner sound; no irritating bass thump on these phones.These are the iPod phones of choice.",4
"I've had my PortaPros for several years now, and they've served me very, very well.Pros:- Best sound I've heard in a small portable headphone. (My Grado SR-80s sound better, but there's no way you'd walk down the street in 'em)- Fold reasonably well into a coat-pocketable clump- Durable as heck (other than the replaceable foam earpiece covers).  I use the heck out of these, and they take it in stride.Cons:- Look pretty un-cool.- Foam earpiece covers need replacing every 50 or so uses - cheap and readily-available from Koss, takes a minute to do.",5
"After doing a bit of research this headphone was recommended as the best portable headphone in the price range, which I mostly agree with.The good:-Great sound quality. Bass booms and highs sound clear.-Much more comfortable than in-canal buds (this may be more of a personal choice).-Stylish but not too garish.The bad:-My hair gets caught in the adjustable band sometimes.-Feels little bit loose on my head, even when it's secure.Also, this is more of a peeve, but the included ""carrying case"" is really just terrible. It's very hard to fit the headphones in there, even when they are folded as small as they can possibly be. You can tell Koss really cheaped out on the material for the bag, it's just too small.",4
"I've owned these for 22 years and still like them. They're a good compromise between tiny portable earphones and full-size home headphones. They sound good and are apparently durable, as I've been using the same pair for all these years. My only reservation is that the foam earpads tend to get damaged when you toss them in a bag with other items, so use the case. I don't remember if mine came with one. Also, consider buying the replacement earpads. I've worn a couple pair out and damaged a couple pair.It's possible that those in-ear earphones have caught up in sound quality, so consider those. I'm not in a hurry to replace my Porta Pros, though.",5
"That's about it, really honest headphones, cheap and the sound is quite balanced. Headband pressure adjustable (firm / light). I find the firm a bit too tight but it's a good setting when being active. Totally recommend.",4
"The first thing that needs to be said about these headphones is that they are really ugly. There can be no denying it. The weird earpieces with the bar atop is just ugly, ugly, ugly. That said, these are easily the most comfortable portables I've worn, a situation largely a product of the very features that make the set ugly. Additionally, the sound is good. I don't feel the sound is as orgasmically supreme as other reviewers suggest, but the sound is very good. If you listen to a lot of Jazz or classical, some senns might serve you better. If you listen to more rock and hip hop, you'll be pleased with the portapros, if only for the comfort, which is truly exceptional. I use them with my iPod, and am well pleased.",5
"These are simply the best headphones that you can purchase for an under $100 price tag, and they are under 50$! Very full, clear, sound with an amazing amount of bass. The styling isn't the greatest in my opinion, but the amazing sound quality more than makes up for it.",5
"Despite looking like they are straight out of 1993, these headphones sound like 2014.  Amazing sound quality that matches my studio headphones, with a durable 'on-the-go' construction.  Base is solid, highs are not peaky or harsh on the ears, and the mids are smooth and warm sounding.Very comfortable on the ears.My original pair stopped working, and I sent them to Koss and for $10 I had a brand new pair sent to me within 2 weeks!!Only complaint is that the way the metal band is designed with two pieces it can pinch your neck hair when sitting around your neck instead of on your head.  Minor complaint but it hurts!",5
"Pro's-Excellent sound quality-Reasonably durableCon's-Fit-StyleLet me explain a little about the cons, Very ugly headphones provided with some temple dampening system that does absolutely nothing. The metal band comes in a very unnatural round bend that make the temple pads barely touch my cranium so they leave me wondering who's oblong head might this design fit perfectly? I have been pondering bending the metal to fit me more properly but I really don't like the idea. The headphones metal bands will pull your hairs and also note if you like loud bass you might want to look elsewhere. There might be a better headset for your portable music needs but I have yet to find something above the sound quality of my porta pros",4
"There are great phones for sure. I have a collection of over ear, on ear, and in-ear phones and developed some critical listening ability and in my experience the Koss sound good. I'm not going to discuss all the genres for the sake of time, but they did sound good for classical and rock and EDM. The retrodesign is fine, but the mechanics of leaves me wary. It does catch my hair on a consistent basis, and despite the pressure settings over the ear, they somehow cause discomfort within an hour. I'm thinking that a relatively small percentage of people would share that experience. I do like the folding mechanism and the life time warranty! Nice. Yes, people say you get a lot for the money, but unless these are your only phones, I'd likely be reaching out for my 'other' phones.",3
"I've been wearing these daily for about 4 months now, and am extraordinarily pleased with them for the price. Yes, there is a caveat- I paid $40 for these, and for *that price* they have fit and/or surpassed all of my expectations. I believe these can compete with any headphones in the &lt;$100 range. I do have two complaints, though.Audio: 4/5. Bass is powerful, highs are clear, mids are crisp enough. Perhaps a little too well blended for rock (not much emphasis on treble), but fantastic for acoustic/instrumental pieces and hip hop.I dock 1 star because of the utter lack of sound isolation. Having on-ear pads with no noise cancellation tech really means NO noise cancelling (duh). This is fine, but it also unavoidably detracts from sound quality when there is any noise around you. The pads also bleed sound easily- I had to be mindful even playing at half volume in public.Aesthetic: 5/5. As authentically retro as you can get, since they are literally from the 80's.Build quality: 5/5. Simplicity makes for durability in this case.-1 for hurting your ears after a couple hours of wear. Fortunately, you can adjust the pads so they angle away from your ears, shifting the pressure up to the side of your head. The springy metal band will allow these to fit any head size. +1 for the 90 degree input jack. Straight jacks get bent out of shape too easily; this design won't suffer the fate of many a pair of iPod earbuds.For the price, there is no superior. That much I will assert strongly. If you want audiophile headphones and have over 100 to spend, or want noise cancellation (take the metro to school/work? you won't want to use these.) then I advise looking elsewhere. If you are on a budget and want simple quality without the bells and whistles, these are perfectly suited for you and you will enjoy uncompromising sound quality.",5
"Had these in college in the early 2000s and now again a decade later. Kind of a cult following of audiophiles, fashion lovers, and retro freaks back then and now. Great punch and bass for a small and simple headphone.  Very good price from Amazon for $30ish vs. Msrp $50 or even higher for limited edition colors or cable volume control.  Great alternative to ear buds or full cans, somewhat portable because they can fold up but they are a little flimsy so I would not recommend packing them tightly or under heavy weight in luggage. Obviously not closed so neighbors will hear your music at louder volumes. However this isn't a problem in louder public venues like the bus, subway, airport, train stn,etc.",5
"i have tried a lot of portable cans - everything ranging from cheap gumdrops, all different beats up to bose noise cancelling) - I always end up coming back to the koss porta pro. Its can fold up into a small package like a mini transformer, its comfortable  (i never got hair stuck - unlike my akgs) and the sound is amazing. Bass is strong, the mids are pretty good. Its very good for current day music. It is very energy efficient - can set your iphone at halfway and still get good sound.I wouldn't recommend it if your musical set is acoustics or other lighter genre however still much better than say stock buds.",5
"Bought these for Christmas, they don't fit to head very well and tend to snap off if bumped.  These are very light weight.  They are still working though.",3
"Work well and easy to use.  The cord is to short, but the sound, build quality, and weight are are outstanding.  These headphones excel in these most important areas.  I will constantly pick them over a more expensive heavy set.",5
"It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones. Just not as good sounds as I thought, or maybe I just played crappy music with lousy mp3 quality, downloaded from unreliable source. I confused.But the good thing is, I can bring it to airplane and don't have to use that even crappier headphones from airlines! yeay!It's not as pretty as it look from the picture though, I think that Beats by dr.Dre look more sturdier than this.",4
"Over the years, I've not had the best luck with portable earphones. Tired of the awful sound of default earbuds, I've experimented with Shure, Bose, Sennheiser,Klipsch, andJVCbrands, ranging in price from $25 to $100, but have never really been satisfied with sound signatures that were either too bass-shy, too muddy, or cramped soundstage. Eventually, I got tired with the uncomfortable and often dirty world of earbuds and decided to go back into the world of on-ear portable phones. Reading at Head-Fi about theKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones, I ordered them from Amazon. While no match for myAudio-Technica A900x headphonesat home, I was impressed with the richness and spaciousness of the KSC75s, but it wasn't long before I found the clips uncomfortable for my ears, so after a couple of months I went ahead and ordered the KSC75's big brother, the PortaPros.I couldn't be happier with my decision. The sound signature is very similar to the KSC75s, but there is a touch more bass and depth. It's not a flat, analytical sound, not too muddy but very fun and warm -- perfect for portable listening around the office. They're open phones, so you'll be able to hear your surroundings and anyone nearby will be able to hear what you're listening to at high volumes, so bear that in mind. Build quality is fair, about what you'd expect for the price range, but the PortaPros are very light on my head. Considering that their sound is superior to a couple pairs of $100 earbuds I've used, I'll take the trade in isolation for comfort and sound quality. I'm also a fan of the 1980s styling.They're not perfect. In addition to the openness and build quality, the headband occasionally pulls out a hair or two, but it doesn't happen often enough to be burdensome. While the PortaPros fold down to a surprisingly compact ball, getting them into the included travel pouch can be a tight fit. Overall, the negatives are greatly outweighed by the positives.If you're in the market for a modestly-priced portable set of headphones, the Koss PortaPros are highly recommended.",5
"The PortaPro has apparently been around since 1985. That in itself should tell you something about this product. I recently bought a notebook computer for around $500. It has a 750GB hard drive. Back in 2000 I bought my first notebook. It had 6gb and cost $1,100. In Electronic product terms these should have been retired decades ago. There are good reasons they haven't been though. The longevity of the PortaPro speaks volume about this product.I am fortunate enough to have a Soul by Ludacris SB300. It is a $300 headphone. I like it a lot. It produces an excellent all around balanced sound that brings out vocals and all instruments. The PortaPro does the same. The PortaPro actually sound better. The sound is breathtaking in its accuracy and clarity. They even leak less sound, are lighter, and require no batteries.  The PortaPro bring an unbelievably accurate, well-balanced, rich, detailed, and lush sound for the price. You are getting the music, all of the music, the way the artists wanted it to be heard. It isn't often a product can cost 8 to 10 Times less than other good products but the PortaPro does. You can get new headphones And a new iPod or other MP3 player and spend less than other headphones and still have the better set of headphones.And they are VERY comfortable and light. The headphones themselves are well padded as is the adjustment bar above. And the adjustment bar works. I have it set in the middle of the comfort zone and get just the right amount of snugness. You also get virtually zero sound leakage. It makes the PortaPro the Perfect work headphones: fantastic sound, virtually no sound leakage, comfortable enough to wear all day, very light, foldable and storable.The only nitpicking I can do is that the headband is not padded and they look maybe a little goofy. But the `goofy' gives you that nice comfort zone. All in all a quite extraordinary product. If Amazon had a product hall of fame where items made it for a combination of performance and value, the PortaPro would be in it for sure. A great gift for yourself or a friend or family member. Lastly before I bought these I did some research and they do have a lifetime guarantee. You can send them in and the shipping back costs a total of $6 from what people related on the internet. You can spend many times more for these and not get any added performance. Thank you Koss.",5
"I've occasionally read reviews about these over the years. But I irrationally felt from their appearance that they probably weren't as good as so many people said they were. But indeed they are. As everyone discovers, the experience of comfort and sound clarity in these matters can be extremely personal. On the basis of sheer discomfort alone, I have greatly disliked every one of all the types of headphones I have ever tried- until now. And anything in-ear is much worse. So I have simply been looking for something/anything with decent sound quality that didn't cause my ears to burn and my entire head to ache after 30 minutes. Now the long frustrating quest merely to find wearable headphones is over at last. What a relief!",5
"These headphones are simply the best headsets ever made. Clear highs, deep lows. I have been using them for years and occasionally need to replace them. $50 at almost any store that sells them, I found them on Amazon for $35.I've tried many other brands over the years and many price ranges, including the noise canceling Bose ones (they hurt my ears.)Nothing comes close.My son destroyed the pair I bought here a few years ago so he's not touching these :-)",5
i bought these because they looked kooky.  they sound good and they're foldable but they're not as comfy as i imagined.  they hurt after an hour or so.,4
"I bought these babies at a FYE when I was just shopping around. I have read that they have amazing sound and you can't find a better sound for the money. Man were the reviewers right! The sound-stage is amazing, with great highs and bass. The bass is delivered so well, I can't find words other than impressive and intense, especially for the size of these headphones. I must say, they get better sound than headphones that range up to $120 and even more easily. I listen to a lot of 60's to 80's rock and all types of heavy metal and the sound is delivered powerfully. A 3D type of Sound. Also try the Koss KSC-75's for an even better performance.Pro's1) Price is unbeatable2) Great balance of high's, mid's and low's3) Ground breaking bass4) Great Sound-stage (Separation of instruments)5) A 3D sound6) Cool 80's design7) Sound doesn't need to be amplified (It shouldn't be either)Con's1) Gets slightly uncomfortable to wear after a while (1 hour or so)2) Seems flimsy at times3) Although it seems to be made of good material, the case/bag that comes with headphones is too small and a pain to get headphones in and out of.",5
"These Koss PortaPro Headphones work great!  Normally the only thing I care about with headphones is how durable they are, though ever since I became an adult, and my head got bigger, I suppose the size and comfort is another thing that needs to be taken into consideration!I used to have REALLY horrible luck with headphones back in the 90's.  The headphones would always lose the volume in one side of the speaker so I'd have to constantly keep readjusting them and twisting the end piece attached to the stereo equipment to get the volume back.  It was annoying.  This problem still exists from time to time, but these particular type of Koss headphones haven't been giving me this particular problem and I'm VERY happy about that.  Nothing worse than when your favorite moment of a song comes on, and BAM- the volume drops out from one side.I highly recommend everyone purchase a pair of these headphones.",5
"For what these cost they do what they do well. They're very comfortable and conform to my head with the medium setting on the ear-piece adjustment. As far as sound goes, I haven't had any complaints. They sound much better than similarly priced headphones that I've owned, and these will be my permanent headphones for being out and about.Sound leaks of course, but you could tell that from the image. Overall I think these are the best headphone for the price range at the time of this review. They've also been surprisingly durable.",5
"So headphones break on me ALL the time. I go through at least a pair every year. I guess I don't treat them amazingly and I like having music on me at all times so they get worn out fast. I realized awhile back I can go two ways on my next pair: cheap and easily replaceable or expensive and higher quality (hopefully lasting longer). I tried the latter a couple times since I'm a bit of an audiophile but this time I was sick of the joint at the jack breaking which is how pretty much every pair I've ever owned has broken (can't wait for the day of cheap, good sound quality wireless!).Then on CNET I saw the Koss Portapro listed as the best bargain headphones and I thought hell why not, my last pair were $10 and they only lasted six months. Got these and I'd say its probably the best dollar to quality value money can buy. The sound is rich and full, especially in the base department. When I first started using them, the treble sounded a little muffled but after a break in period I stopped noticing. I listen to a lot of bass heavy electronic music as well as alternative/indie rock and these cans are perfect for it. Because they're over here, you're not going to get great isolation but its good enough. Loud traffic might leak in a bit (and a good bit of sound leaks out) but its just enough to be aware of your surroundings while enjoying your music. I leave the fit on tight to get the best isolation though you can conveniently loosen things up if you want. They feel very nice on my big head either way with the temple pads. The retro stylings are pretty cool and they're definitely unique in their design.Some problems:I like the portable collapse mode but the included case (which is actually a very nice little pleather bag) is too tight a fit. Every time I squeeze the cans in there I'm afraid I'm going to break them or that I'm wearing the wire connections unnecessarily. I'll probably end up using the pouch for some other purpose though since it is quite nice. Along similar lines, it seems like they cut the cost so low by chucking out a lot of the casing and other ""useless"" plastics on the headset but that makes them feel overly fragile. So far they're holding up fine but they definitely feel a bit light. Likewise the plug is a bit small and looks like a definite Achilles heel. Lastly the cord is only 4' so if your audio source isn't in your pocket or nearby, you may run into trouble sans extension.Summary:Great deal for the money so why not? Also, packaging says Koss covers them for life though we'll cross that bridge when we  come to it.",4
"Original Review: I'm getting ready for a three week trip with a lot of flying to South America, so I thought I'd read the reviews for all the noise cancelling headphones out there and ended up buying the Sennheiser PXC250s.... they sound decent, but compared to my cheapo Koss PortaPros, they SUCK.The KOSS PortaPro is simply the best lightweight travel headphone I've ever owned.  I'm not sure why they're so retro looking, but they're really comfortable and sound like high end headphones without being giant monsters... the sound quality and the bass and volume levels are amazing.Don't question yourself... buy these and try them out and you'll be extremely happy that you did!!!!Updated: 2011....  Wow, I can't believe I bought these in 2003!  The earpads, after almost 8 years, need replacement.  That's it.  They still sound amazing when I put them on and they make music oh so enjoyable compared to earbuds... not even $500 earbuds sound as good as these little $30ish 1970s looking headphones... and they're now actually just retro enough looking and to me say ""hey, those must sound awesome because they're sorta ugly"" so I wear them proudly. Don't hesitate... plus you have 30 days to try them out, that's why Amazon is so awesome.",5
"These headphones are ok, but they look cheap, since they are, and I didn't notice much difference in the sound quality from my sparkplug's to these. I couldnt wear these for more than an hour without them hurting my ears, but for the price you could certainly do worse. Honestly though, if your willing to go to in ear headphones, go with the spark plugs, the are better at noise isolating, fit better in your ears, and I really cant notice a diffrence in sound quality + they're like half the price.",3
"I've had these for a while, haven't used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on CD. Okay to good sound, but the durability isn't great --- one of the ear pieces constantly comes off. It can be re-placed, but it's a nuisance.",4
"It was my first plunge into the MP3 world and I felt that the key would be choosing the right headphones.  Following a good deal of research I believe I made the right choice.These Koss PortaPro's are lightweight with an excellent sound, and the unique design makes them very comfortable.  I have tried the Bose $220 headsets - and if you fly alot they're probably worth it for the sound dampening  effect - but if someone makes a better sounding set for less than twice as much - buy it.  For $35 these are well worth the money.U P D A T E: Purchased in January 2008, I've been using these for 4 years now and have been through 3 or 4 sets of earpiece covers. They still sound great!  [One time I thought the bass had gone out on one side as it had an awful rattle, but I cleaned it out - it was a hair against a speaker - and it sounded fine again.  So check for debris before you toss yours out.]",5
"One of the best truly portable headphones you can get. Perfect for portable devices if you don't mind looking a little geeky with it's 80's styling. The next step up would be Grado SR60 or Sony MDR-v6 (which i own) but those are a lot bulkier and more expensive.It has very strong bass for its size. The only thing I would change is a better quality wire that lasts longer. On the plus side, it does have the Koss lifetime warranty (just pay the shipping).",4
"These Koss headphones have an excellent dynamic range and will support full, rich sound in spite of their light weight. Its easy to forget that you're wearing these because they're comfortable and adjust well. They don't squeeze on the ears and head like a lot of headphones do but they stay put comfortably. I also like the way the headphones fold into such a small size, they fit in a coat pocket or computer case pocket. While they look like they might be a little frail, they seem to be pretty rugged. I have a few different sets of headphones and these became my instant favorite.",5
"... but great headphones, period, for any application.  These are my favorite headphones - that's not to say they're the most detailed, accurate, or will fool you into thinking they're a set of Stax or anything (they are, of course, astonishingly accurate and detailed).  No other headphones combine this level of comfort, soundstage, openness, and plain excitement into such a compact, durable, and CHEAP package.  These are tiny tiny tiny, but rock out with authority.There's been a lot of jibber jabber on these fair internets about the newest contender for the portable headphone crown - the Sennheiser PX100.  I bought a pair of those Senns and lived with them for a couple of months - they are acceptable for a set of portable cans, I guess, but tend to get very congested and cluttered in the midrange.  They're also bland and cold.  Beyond sound, they're not even as comfortable as the PortaPros, as they require constant adjustment to stay on top of your head while you're walking around.  Finally, the Senns are not only less durable than the PortaPros, but the warranty is only two years vs.  Koss's incredible NO QUESTIONS ASKED LIFETIME WARRANTY.  That's right, you never have to buy a set of headphones again, until you die.  Just incredible.  If you want to demo this sound t a lower price, try out the Koss KSC 75 ear clip model, but be warned they're nowhere near as comfortable.  Buy with confidence.",5
"These are by far the best sounding portable headphone I've ever heard. They are very efficient and play louder than most small headphones of this type. The sound on the low end defies their small size and they have plenty of great sound at the top too. As far as style goes I've heard a lot of people complain that they are out of date looking. I'm not quite sure what the problem is. Just about any headphones of this type are going to be a band with two round speakers, not much you can do in the way of ""style"". If you would prefer the band to go behind your head you can try the SportaPro. For the money these are hard to beat. The sound is so good they make a good choice for everyday listening as well as activities where portability is needed.",5
"Seriously, are these airplane headphones?  That's how poor I found the sound quality in these.  I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself, wow, what a let down.  They do look cool but even the $5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these.  I cannot believe this is Koss, I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad.",1
"The earphones are fine, but they create too much pressure physically on the skull (ears).  They don't just sit, they squeeze onto your ears.  Definitely a minus for me.  Maybe I'll get used to them, but so far I feel it was a bad call.",2
"I bought these after Shure jacked up the price of their mini headphone from $30 to $90 (huh?).  Anyway, these sound just fine and are comfortable.My only complaint is how each side of the head band is connected together, that if I adjust it while on my head, my hair can get caught under the band.  Yoowwwzaaaa!  I don't have long hair, so I would imagine it would be even worse for those people.",4
"I didn't care much for these the first time I heard them, tried them again and liked them very much, but later just seemed flat and not much life in there.  At first a wrote a positive review, but the more I listen the less I like",3
"Great sound, time proven stats and abilities. Check out reviews elsewhere, I did, these are the best quality for the price.",5
"I've heard nothing but good things about these and I finally decided to try them. The verdict? Not bad at all (for the price) but I'm not sure they deserve such high praise.Pros....1. Obviously, they're very affordable and they sound pretty good2. Compact and very portableCons...1. Sound can be a bit muffled at times. Sometimes there's a bit too much bass. This is not terribly distracting once you get used to it but it is noticeable if you're listening for it at all.2. The touted feature that's supposed to make them more comfortable doesn't seem to do much at all for me.3. The cushions are fairly comfortable for what they are but they are a tad small on my ears and this becomes a bit scratchy and uncomfortable after a couple of hours.I'd buy them again if I had a tight budget and needed a set of compact, portable headphones. But I'd think about stepping up to something a bit better sounding if I could spend more.",4
"Not sure if anyone else experienced this but mine had some wierd rattle on the left ear that went away if I hit it hard enough or let it play for a few seconds. if I let it ""cool down"" the issue would come back. not sure what it was but had that not been a problem I might have kept them. the sound was average and I do not understand why people say it had ridiculous bass, I don't think it did. This is an average sounding headphone by comparison. nothing to write home about. I got the Sony V6 and those are very good, glad I got those, would like to try the Audio Technica m50 one day. I also got those really popular panasonic earbuds here for like $5.87, those also suck, the JVC Gumy earbuds sound way better. I think those earbuds represent a good value like the Pinnacle PN8+. I know that's not an earphone but the Gumys really are  that good of a value at 7 bucks. anyways I might give these portapro another chance...probably not though.",2
"I listen to Rock (Stones, Bruce, Led Zep, Doobies, Kate Bush, Eurythmics, etc.) and tons of Classical -- lots of Beethoven, but also choral (Rutter and P&auml;rt) and Baroque (Handel and Bach) and especially piano concertos. I discovered Jazz about two years ago and listen to much Bill Evans and Miles and Tord Gustavsen. I own Grado 225 headphones, NAD CD player, and a nice Yamaha-powered music setup with Paradigm speakers. What's my favorite listening experience? My iPhone with these Koss Porta-Pros! On my second pair now and always keep a spare pair in the study in case I ever lose these Porta-Pros. Bass is fantastic and mids perfect. I would boost the treble a bit to match the purity of my Grados, but nothing can touch the bang-for-buck experience of these Koss 'phones. Greatest experience for rock music. I'm loving them more every day. Not just great portable headphones -- they are amazing headphones, period. Buy now.",5
"This morning they sold for $38.72 or something like that. Then they jumped the price to only a 10% discount. Now, it's a 15% discount.This is a bad business practice and Amazon is doing this more and more. It lessens the ability to purchase a product. I was ready to doit, but not when they suddenly jumped the price. I like the phones but not price jumps when I show interest in something.",4
"These sound amazing, hands down the best under fifty you can buy. Not as stylish as some or even as durable but with a lifetime warrenty you can't go wrong. 4.5",4
"Best sounding open ear headphones I've ever heard. I've used them almost every day for a long time. Bass is very powerful for something that doesn't enclose the ear. Sound is very clear and they can also handle a lot of power. As others have said, the headband can rip out a few hairs occasionally, but that is the only complaint I have.",5
"These are great headphones for the money.  I wish the cord was a little longer as I use them at my desk.  The sound is far better than I've found with others in this price range, so it's a reasonable trade-off for me.  The lifetime guarantee doesn't hurt, either.",5
There's not much I can add to what's already been said about the Koss PortaPro headphones. These have got to be one of the best values out there today. Sound is phenomenal. Comfort (for me) is very good. The only area for concern that I could see was the quality of the cable/jack. I added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress. I think that will be sufficient. Highly recommend this product.,4
"In comparing the Koss PortaPro with the Sennheiser 201, which is a good deal cheaper (and also quite a bit bulkier), I've concluded that both headphones are amazing for the price, but they're quite different. The PortaPro has significantly more bass. I had to keep the volume at about 50% what I keep it at for the Sennheiser. The PortaPro is perfect if you're really into bass, if you're really into the beat. The Sennheiser is better for purity of sound. I just feel that, in general, it gives a truer, purer sound. The sound that the original artist had in his/her head. A lot of people will LOVE the beat on this. But some people will find it overpowering. I'm listening to ""Something"" by The Beatles right now, and I'm pretty sure George didn't want Paul's bass to dominate so much.Or maybe this is the best way to put it: you know how when you go into the movie theater and the previews start playing, you're struck by how great the surround sound is? It's so rich and bassy, you can practically feel your bones vibrate. That's what the Koss PortaPro is like. It's GREAT for watching movies. But it just doesn't give the purest vocal sound for music. If you want to turn up the volume to focus on the vocals, the bass will deafen you.The sound went out in one side after 6 months. The headphones lay on the shelf for a year, because I never got around to mailing it in for warranty (they'll replace it for you but it isn't free). And then I decided to fix it myself, so I got a new plug from Radioshack and got down and dirty with wires for an hour. After 45 minutes I was cursing myself for choosing to do this myself. But finally I got it to work. And to keep it that way, I'm not going to use it on the move. I recommend getting a cheap pair of earbuds for when you're moving around (the Sony MDR J10 is my favorite - it stays on and it has lasted me longer than any other brand), and keeping these relatively more expensive headphones for use at home. As you move around, the wire bends in your pocket, and eventually the connection is severed.Oh, and I agree with other reviewers that these headphones do get painful after a while. But I kind of think that's a good thing...it limits your headphone use and will probably save your hearing in the long-run. And you do have to learn how to take them off without them pulling out your hair.",5
"Years ago I was introduced to a st of Koss Studio Pros.  They were actually a full-size headphone which looked very similar to these. They were lightweight, very comfortable, and had the most amazing clarity.  It seems to me that Koss has simply miniaturized the very same Koss headphones I had years ago. They are lightweight, very comfortable, and retain the same clarity of the larger phones I used to have. These are excellent for listening to acoustic music as well as rock. The highs are crisp and clean and bass is fat and full, but not overwhelming like the Dre's.  One of the things that I noticed more so than other headphones I've own is the separation of sound. You can distinguish the left and right channel clearly. It totally adds to the listening experience.  My only complaint is, as far as I know, Koss has discontinued the full-size version of this headphone which I used to have.  I would like to see it on the market again, but until then, I am very pleased with these.",5
The 'gold' plug on these earphones is slightly smaller than regulation which causes the right earphone to cut out on some devices.  I bought TWO of these puppies and they are both defective.  The problem does not show up until they have been used for some hours (weeks).,1
I use to own these same headphones back in the 80's and they are still dynamic!  I would recommend these headphones to anyone!,5
"These audiophile headphones have no business being less than $40.  Well, they kind of do...They sound great and have audio design by John Bruss.  The sound imaging is pretty amazing and they respond beautifully in their frequency range at all volumes.  I wear them for ~7 hrs per day at work and they're not as fatiguing as earbuds.  The look is VERY 80s, so you def won't have to worry about people stealing your surprisingly awesome headphones.  The headband can grab your hair if you pull them on over your head, so make sure to pull them open before putting them on.They saved money on the industrial design, but spared no expense on the audio quality.",5
"Do you wanna look like a jogger from 1982?  Do you want your music to sound fantastic at the same time?  These are your headphones.  Seriously, they sound excellent.",5
They are a little overated do sound muddy depends on the track you listen to but highs never sound like they should.I wouldnt say there bassey but more of a swamped out muffled.You could do better if you look around but there not bad but if you own these they cant be you only pair,5
"Koss Porta Pros are the headphone of choice if you like to listen loud with deep bass.  They have a bit of trouble boosting treble because of this, but they are well balanced for most recordings so it doesn't really matter.Many have complained about the headphones being too tight, but I have a pretty big grape and have no trouble wearing these on a two hour walk.I use these with my awesome Archos JukeBox Recorder 10, and they are a killer combo.  Many MP3 players sacrifice a resonable amp for smaller size, so these Porta Pros will help salvage players with diminutive amps.The only complaint with my Porta Pros is they are open ear, and people are always noticing my music, even though they all admit I'm not listening that loud once they try them on.",4
Read all the reviews before buying it and had expected more.  But in reality I really should not have since I didn't pay too much for it.  The main thing that really dislike about it is that the collapsing mechanism isn't stiff enough and I find I have to make sure I'm putting it on with both hands or else the headphones will fold in.  Other than that I think it is okay.  I'm not much of an audiophile so I'll leave the sound quality and what not to those in the know.,3
"If you love the bass in the music, this is your headphones! This is a real killer with high expression of basses, high quality sound, good noise-blocking, comfy (but you probably will feel uncomfort in an hour, it causes sweating and heating in ears after some time), light-weighted and in contrast to style arguments of other reviews, pretty stylish with its blue color and metal connection.I strongly recommend the product. Especially given its price...",5
"I bought these Koss ProPorta headphones after getting tired of the small in-ear headphones. I've had a bunch of them, including Bose and Bang & Olufsen. These are better than any of those. I was just looking for something to use with my computer at work. I don't use them a lot, but am now finding myself using them a lot more than I used to.For what I wanted these for and for the price, not sure how you can beat them. I've also had the high-end Bose noise canceling headphones, but they are so big and bulky that I just don't carry them with me when I travel. Several of the reviews commented on how hard it was to get these into the leather-like storage bag that comes with them. I did not find it a problem at all. They fold up and hook together and easily fit inside the bag. They are super comfortable (my hair is short so the hair pulling isn't an issue). The way they're built, they'll probably last forever or at least until I get tired of them.I wouldn't hesitate a moment to buy these. Hey if you don't like them, you're only out about $30. I'm not a sound expert, so they sound pretty darned good to me and much better than all the small ones I've been using.",5
Very deep bass for such little headphones needs a break in period top of head set can be a little uncomfortable in extended use other than that great value,4
Ha widths years ago.Design looks a bit lighter than back then but has added fit switch (tight or loose) which is nice.As ever great sonice and the price I got it for ($25!!!) was a steal.Great choice for comfortable home use and moderately active outdoor performance!!!!!!!!,5
"I was seeking new headphones to replace my iPod nano headphones which are pathetic. I had some Koss earbud headphones that I loved but lost, so I needed new ones. So I came on here to find reviews of other headphones and saw that the reviews for the PortaPro were great. Since I had a great experience with Koss in the past (they replaced my earbuds on my old phones for free, no questions asked), I decided to try these. The reviews are right-on.I'd describe the sound of these phones as if two of the best speakers you've ever heard were on both sides of your head. The sound is great at all volumes. The clarity is such that I can hear parts of songs that I never heard before. The lows, mids, and highs are perfect. Some headphones sound bad at high volumes, and the sound gets muddy and the bass sort of shakes in your ear. Well you don't get that with these. It's like you're in the studio recording with the band. You can tell the difference between a 160kbps, 192kbps, and a 256kbps mp3 file with these headphones. The only thing I don't like about them is that I can hear outside noise, like cars whizzing by (a good thing, I guess) or the engine on the bus. This can be kept to a minimum by turning the volume up.The headphones look big because of the ""headrests"" they have, but  they are ergonomic. I was playing a video game while listening to these phones at forgot they were on because I didn't feel them on my head. They have three comfort settings: light, medium, and firm. They also come with a little case which is nice. The phones fold up to the size of a baseball, and both speakers fold inward. A small clip exists on the bottom of each phone, which attaches both sides together when you fold them. You then wrap the cord up and go. They can fit into a typical pocket. These are portable headphones, and I don't know why people say otherwise.They are some of the best headphones I've ever heard. No surprise Koss makes them. They are also manufactured in the USA so there is no outsourcing of jobs with these phones. I can understand why these phones have been on the market since the 1980s. They're fantastic.",5
"To anyone who hasn't tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the ""comfort zone"" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.",3
"Being a headphone freak since I was first turned on to them in 1968 Viet Nam. I find these to be a good pair to use with my portable CD player while working at my P.C. I have numerous and sundry headphone, from high end Sennheiser, to junky chepos that I purchased because of my headphone fetish. I even own a couple of the vaunted sound canceling phone.I have always liked Koss products, especially my old PRO 4AAs. These PORTA PROS have a warm sound and as I like my music loud sometimes and soft and low sounds other time, they are perfect for me. I would give them a hearty thumbs up.",5
"If comfort is your issue, these headphones do the job. I have very sensative ears. These heasdphones direct the pressure away from your ears and it is much more evenly distributed than any headphones I've tried (besides my super expensive noise cancelling headphones.",4
"These are awesome headphones. I work in a crowded (load) office, and there are days that would be almost unbearable without these headphones. I am able to crank up the volume, and the sound quality is excelent. The bass produced from such a small package is remarkable.I did have to replace one set of the cushions after a few years, and eventualy one of the speaker wires started to short out. Koss stood behind their lifetime warrenty, and replaced the unit.The first pair of headphones I bought (in the '80s) were from Koss, and my experiences with their lifetime warrenty has made me a lifetime customer.",5
Most cheap headphones claim they can reproduce bass down to 20 Hz but these are the only ones that even come close to matching that claim. The clarity and durability of these headphones is also amazing.,5
"I adore these headphones! I'm really hard on them and use the things almost daily. They get shoved into my bag, ripped out, tossed around, and stuff like that. Other than the time I stepped on one of the plastic sides and snapped it (but superglue fixed everything!) they're just the same as when I got them last year. I tried using the blue tabs to adjust how tight they are but didn't have any success. Bass and sound quality is superb. Whenever mine break I'm getting another pair!",5
I have owned a pair of Koss Porta-Pros back when they first came out and could not believe the sound from these headphones. I have tried other brands but have never had as good of a frequency response that these headphones can produce. I will never buy any other pair of over the ear headphones as long as they keep these in production. They are that good.,5
"I own 1 each of grado sr 80, sennheiser rs 65 and both the koss sportapros and portapros.  The sound you get with the portapro is as rich to me as the grado sr 80.  Its amazing that such a light headphone can produce the same rich highs and deep lows. Accuracy is no problem for the portapros since there is not much material.Between the portapros and sportapros, I think the portas sound better (The sportapro has developed a light distortion with bass, the reason I recently purchased the portapro).  The sportas metal band does not slip as much as the porta but the porta one-ups again with an adjustable ""comfort zone"" setting for the temporal pads. Design-wise, I like the more masculine look of the portas over the sportas and never used the behind-the-ear configuration of the sportas.",5
"I bought these headphones based on suggestions and reviews I'd read on the internet. I wanted something with decent sound and comfort that wouldn't break the bank; I will be traveling abroad for a semester, and needed something with which to enjoy my music without the comfort of my micro stereo. I wasn't sure what to expect as I'm not much of an audiophile, but I was very pleased with the PortaPros. They are very comfortable, provide ample bass and overall sound quality, and fold up to make them quite portable to boot (go figure). The included case and 1/4"" audio adapter were nice bonuses. I am using them with an iPod and my laptop, both sound even better than my stereo with the PortaPros. Only thing I dislike is that the hook to keep them latched together in ""travel mode"" doesn't hold all that well.If you buy them, consider getting some of the foam ear pad replacements to go with (Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions). The headphones will last, but the pads might eventually tear (they did on my old Sony headphones).",5
"As a drummer I normally opt for bigger headsets that are enclosed, especially for playing electronic drums... the problem is that they don't let your head & ears breathe, making it uncomfortable to wear for long sessions.I bought these with the intention of using them for my mp3 player, but I thought, why not give them a try with the V-Drum kit.  WOW!  These cans really pump... the frequency range was something I totally did not expect, especially when monitoring a live electronic music instrument - drums no less!  These headphones handled the pounding drum sounds perfectly and with no fatigue at all.  I was able to also hear other live instruments as well.  The only drawback is the level at which these headphones start to distort out... (now this is a level which I believe is way beyond normal listening levels - remember, this is from a band rehearsal at full volume.)So, during a solo practice session, these did a phenominal job.  However, it is a lot to ask these headphone to be the primary monitor cans during a full blown gig - the sound pressure levels are too much.But, if you're looking for great headphones that are comfortable to where for long periods and sound fantastic, then these are the ones!I highly recommend them!",5
"Sweet, cheap, glorious sounding phones. Get a volume control (also Koss) and you are all set.  Cord is a bit short, but plugged into the volume control you will have plenty of length. These are really excellent sounding phones. I couldn't believe the difference between a couple of other cheap ones I have.  Highly recommended!These have been highly regarded for many years, and I recall having had a pair maybe 15 years ago. Also you may want to buy some replacement foam pads. I use mine outside and they get a lot of sweat on them. Changing pads is a breeze.",5
"These are the best pair of headphones I've ever used.  I only had to buy this pair because I somehow broke my last pair (had for over 2 years).  The breaking was all my fault; nobody should expect a pair of headphones to survive being run over by a car.  Mea culpa!  Seriously though, the audio is the best I've ever heard from non-noise canceling headphones.  I use these on walks and jogs, so I need something that doesn't completely drown out ambient noise.  They do drown out softer noises (much more than earbuds) so be careful!",5
"OK....so here goes another comparison between the Koss Portpros and the Sennheiser 100's? I am not going to bore you..Both headphones are outstanding performers with an Ipod...I own them both...So which one is my preference? The Sennheisers, for one reason only...People use their Ipods in malls and on the go. There are times when I want to remove the phones from my ears for a few moments (say, in a store or when having conversation).With the Sennheisers, I can remove the phones from my ears and let them ""hang"" around my neck in comfort...Try this with the Koss's and they will place a stranglehold on you. For this reason alone, I recommend the Senn's. Both,in my humble opinion, sound equally good.",5
"I need to say it up front: these are the ugliest headphones ever. With that out of the way, I can heap mounds of praise upon them.Sound is paramount, of course, and these are no exception. I sort of prefer the sound of these to some of the closed-eard headphones (which I think sound like a cave sometimes). They almost sound good as the Sennheiser 497 (not as good, of course, but still impressively close, given their price).They are exceptionally comfortable. At the risk of sounding corny, they feel like wearing air.They can folded up to very small dimensions, a nice plus.",5
While you're shopping just remember this fact:KOSS PORTAPRO--ROCKIN OUT NONSTOP SINCE 1984 BECAUSE OF OVERWHELMING CUSTOMER DEMAND.There's one solid fact about the performance of portable headphones and that's it.  Go with the proof.,5
"I bought these headphones a few years ago, after reading all the glowing reviews on Amazon, and I'm so glad I did.  I'm pretty rough with my headphones, and these things can take a beating.  I ended up replacing a pair after 2 years, which is unbelievable in itself, because I usually go through a pair of headphones every six months.  And it wasn't because they didn't work, it's just because the wire near the jack was exposed and getting frayed.  Here are all the pros:Value:  They are a great value for the money.  I've had more expensive headphones that didn't sound as good.  Even if you don't want to spend thirty-something dollars for headphones and don't care what they sound like, I still think it would be worth it, because you won't have to replace them every six months when something breaks on them.  These headphones are very durable and aren't made of flimsy plastic like less expensive ones are, so in the long run, they would be worth it.Comfort:  These are very comfortable.  There are 2 settings, tight and loose, to adjust for different head sizes.  I've never had a problem with the ear pads wearing out or anything digging into my ears, or whatnot.  These fit very comfortably on my head (I have a big head btw) and I've never had a problem with them sliding off.Portability:  These aren't the smallest earphones in the world, but certainly not the biggest.  They do fold up if you need to pack them and they come with a little pouch to put them in.  I bring them along on trips on all the time and I've never had a problem with them.Sound Quality:  They sound fantastic!  Better than a lot of more expensive headphones.  Though any headphone with the Koss name sounds great, I think these are the best.  Just the right amount of bass and treble.  Doesn't sound tinny, or like you're playing music in a tunnel.  If you're used to less expensive headphones, you're going to hear stuff in your music you never heard before.Ease of Use:  Well, most headphones aren't hard to use, and these are the same.  The only drawbacks to these is I found it hard to adjust to loose/tight setting on the sides and they are sort of of a pain to fold up (which is why I never fold them up).  I've owned foldable headphones that were much worse though.Build:  Awesome!  The headband is metal and the casing for the earphones are hard plastic and very durable.  Not long ago, I accidently broke off one of the earpieces.  Guess what, it pops right back in!  Five stars for build!I've never buy another pair of headphones, ever.  I bought 3 pairs of these, (One for home, one for the gym, and one to replace the ones from home) and I plan to buy more in the future, if need be.  I love love love these headphones.The only slight con I can think of is they aren't 'sleek' looking like other headphones, in fact they look like they came straight out of 1982.  I don't really care what they look like though, and quality of these headphones more than make up for the ugliness.",5
"I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.",5
They look old school but these things are awesome. I bought the replacement pads too but haven't had to use them yet. The sound quality is amazing and you don't lose anything like you sometimes do with noise canceling headphones.,5
"Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.",1
"I really wanted to love these. After reading rave reviews about their quality and history, I thought these would be great for listening to music and podcasts at the office. For years, I've been wearing a pair of cheapo earbuds (Philips Flexible Earhook Headphones SHS3200/28 (Black) (Replaces SHS3200/37)) that were extremely comfortable and got the job done, but I decided it was time to upgrade to something with better sound. Sound-wise, I honestly wasn't blown away by these. Yes, they offer more bass than most portable headphones, but the bass on these strikes me as muddy and overpowering. In terms of comfort, after several hours of use, my ears started to ache from the pressure of the headband even with the ""Comfort Zone"" switches set to the lightest setting. In contrast, I can wear my $8 Philips earbuds all day with no fatigue or discomfort. This might not be an issue if you're not planning on extended listening sessions (they're fine for an hour or so), but if you're planning on wearing them for longer periods, you're in for a headache.",2
"I think these are great for the price, but they lack low end bass as they are compact, and the padding simply isn't there, to keep space to a minimum once again, but overall, I'm very much happy with them. Keep an eye out for a video review on the SonicOrbStudios YouTube channel for more :)",4
"I've purchased 3 sets of these over the years for my son and his mother. 2 of the 3 are still going strong. My son has managed to destroy a pair of these and bunches of others but I digress.  In every way possible these are great headphones. Portable, easy to use, sufficient bass, and fairly priced to boot. If I used an MP-3 player of any kind I'd have a pair of these. Since I'm more a full-range stereo kinda guy, my big boy Sennheisers fill my bill. I have used these headphones on occaision however and can't recommend them more highly.Da Worfster",4
"You notice more sounds with these headphones.  This is one example of traditional electronics that will never be beat, especially at this price.",5
"Sure these headphones look a bit wierd. A matter of taste at best.However the sound is great! Whether the source is a smartphone, tablet or PC this is an excellent sounding headphone for the price.",5
"I felt inclined to write a review because I was so impressed by these headphones... I had tried a bunch in the process looking for headphones in the $150 range, tried Bose OE ($180), Sony XB700 ($90), Pioneer Home Theater A1000 ($95), Sony V700 ($85)... Out of the more expensive headphones I thought the Bose OE sounded the best (very clean crisp highs, and great bass and VERY comfortable).The only headphones that came close to the Bose OE (in terms of sound) were these Koss Portapros and they cost 1/6th the price!! Some people were saying the new design of the cable meant that they are using cheaper materials or something?? Totally untrue, the headphones feel and look great, are comfortable enough for a good couple hours, and sound amazing!Even if you plan to buy some expensive headphones I really think you should have a pair of these... I actually just ordered a $350 pair of Denon d2000, but I don't regret the Portapros one bit, they are awesome, great bass, good mids and highs (albeit not as good as the Bose, but close enough considering the drastic price difference).Update (after 1 month use): Recently I purchased some Denon d2000 and Beyer Dynamic t990 (both retail over $300) I still can't believe how good the Koss stand up to them. For fun I tried connecting the Koss to my Nuforce uDac-2 HP (amp/dac) and they sound even better; mind you the Denons and Beyers have more clarity but once again considering the cost of the Koss it's worth purchasing for portable use even if you have expensive hi-fi headphones. Still impressed!",5
"I've been listening to these for years and years.  For the price they are simply amazing.  Great bass response.  Crystal clear highs.  Wonderful for all kinds of music: pop, rock, jazz, classical, soundtracks.  I actively go out and listen to the competition all the time.  I did just order the Sennheister Px 100s because evidently they edge past the Koss headphones.  I find this hard to believe, but we'll see.  I do love the Bose Q2's and plan to get those for home and travel.  But when it comes to serious street bopping: for the Koss.  You will not be sorry!! Promise.",5
"I got my PortaPro phones yesterday, and I am frankly disappointed.My intention was to use these phones with my computer for music listening at late hours. I was instantly defeated by the useless 4-foot cord length. I should have checked that out, but managed to miss it. Nearly every headphone designed for home use (as these originally were), come with at least five or six feet of cord-length. So right there, I was out of luck. Oh well, I thought, I can always use them with my MP3 player.My second discovery is that Koss, like many headphone manufacturers, is targeting it's smaller phones for the highly lucrative iPod market. This means that the guys in marketing are calling the shots. Not surprisingly, the phones have a cord-length that's right for the iPod crowd but not home users. Further, the sound has the exaggerated bass popular with kids into hip-hop, but at the cost of a balanced natural sound. I would describe the sound as smooth and quite pleasant, but rather unnatural. The low end is very exaggerated and the mid-range is down about 5dB. The highs are also way down, perhaps 6 or 8dB. Using my players equalizer I can make the sound acceptable, but these phones are typical of the ""bass is what the kids are buying"" school of design. Without a lot of tone control effort you should expect a bass-heavy sound that lacks any definition in the all-important midrange. I'm a lifelong headphone listener who has used Grado, Sennheiser, AKG, and even high-end electrostatics. I know good phones. These disappoint. I suspect that most of the reviews reflect people who don't use headphones much.One other point. Koss has been praised for it's generous warranty. Maybe, but read the fine print. Koss will replace or repair the phones (their option), if you provide a check for $6 and suitable packaging. Picture that. I spend $6 for repairs, $3 for a shipping box requiring a post-office visit, another $6 for shipping, and still another trip to the post-office. Some lifetime warranty. Incidentally, I would estimate the phones cost a maximum of $5 to make. Seriously, I base this estimation on material costs and the manufacturing processes, which I am familiar with.In conclusion, I cannot recommend these phones to anyone who values Balanced Sound over punchy bass.",3
"I remember seeing these in K-Mart way back in college. Hard to imagine that they're still making them, or that they're really still that good! Perhaps the latter is the reason for the former. You can spend a couple hours online reading one review after another after  google-ing &#34;best bang for the buck headphones under $100.&#34; Yeh, I did that. Or you can just take 8 seconds and click &#34;add to cart&#34; and get them delivered to your door in a day or so. Really, you're not going to be sorry. Really. No, really.",5
"Things I like:- Metal band seems durable and is easy to adjust- Sound quality- Affordable price (I'm not an audiophile, don't want to spend $100+ on headphones but I still want headphones of significantly higher quality than earbuds)- LightweightThings I don't like:- Nothing so farI wanted some higher quality headphones for use with my desktop computer; I found many quality headphones at the $100+ price point but wasn't looking for high-end headphones. I just wanted a medium to medium-high quality pair at a decent price that would provide better quality sound than your standard headphones. After reading many reviews and doing a lot of research, I found the portapros and am happy with them. The sound is more rich, bass comes through surprisingly well without sacrificing the high end. They are comfortable to wear for an 1 to 1.5 hours at a time and are very lightweight so you don't always ""notice"" them on your head. I don't carry them around anywhere, but the fold-up mechanism does make these pretty portable if that's what you will use them for. I'm very pleased with these and would purchase them again; they come with a lifetime warranty though, so I may be set for life.I'm sure there higher quality headphones out there that produce much better sound than these; the portapros produce great sound for the average to slightly discerning listner and are priced affordably. To give you a better idea about the portapro's sound quality,,,0=worst, fuzzy, crackly sound that makes it seem like your listing to a poorly tuned AM station10=best, sitting in an acoustically designed room listening to cutting edge, $10,000+ plus speakersPair of $25 JVC earbuds I got at Walmart and junked within 3 minutes: 1Stock iPod earpieces: 3My Vizio soundbar (with subwoofer): 7Koss PortaPros: 5Surround sound system: 8",4
"Well, I have had these for quite a while, and they are simply amazing in regards to sound quality, especially for the price.  The sound quality is a solid 5 stars.  They have very crisp and accurate sound reproduction, a spacious soundstage, wonderfully controlled low-range response, and mids and highs that are just the right balance of warm and bright sound.  They are clean and not sibilant at all.  The only down side is the design.  They are awkward to adjust and to wear.  They also tend to pull your hair.  The temple pads are a dumb idea on headphones that are so light and not noise-isolating.  They also will not fit into or out of their included soft case without almost destroying them. But for sound quality alone these are absolutely untouchable at anywhere near the price range.When I'm really needing a portable headphone I usually go with the soundmagic e10's.  They aren't quite as nice to listen to as these Koss porta Pros, but they also block out outside noise and are still amazing to listen to.  They absolutely trounce any other earbuds I have listened to for under $70.",4
"I'm actually surprised they still work after so long!  They have decent quality (nothing compared to a more expensive brand, but still better than in earbuds), and they are strong.  I have sat on them and squashed them, yet they still stayed together and kept their shape perfectly.  The problem I had with them was the U shape of them would always get caught on other cables and chords and trust me, that is SO frustrating!  Also, they always close automatically so you have to resize them every time you put them on.  Didn't mind either of these things the first few months, then they eventually start getting to you, trust me on this.  Overall, for this price, they are good, durable portable headphones with good sound, but those gripes I have lead me to not recommend them to constant music listeners...",4
"I've tried to give Koss praise for these all over the internet where ever I can.These headphone just do not get enough credit.They are small, hold well on your head and sound FANTASTIC.Granted if you want full on studio get big $200 to $400 dollar over the ear headphones, but for a reasonable second place when you are jogging at the gym, these are the ticket.I've bought about 3 or 4 pairs and plan to buy these for the rest of my life unless I hear something better.That hasn't happened in a decade so far....The BEST.  Try them out!",5
"After hearing the crisp, full sound of my cousin's Koss PortaPro Headphones, I had to buy a pair of my own, especially after the fact that my awesome old Skullcandy headphones failed after 2 1/2 years of service.Awesome, they arrived 4 days earlier than originally projected, so I open the box to find a shiny new pair of Koss PortaPros. I had about 5 minutes to sample the awesomeness before I had to go to work, so I fold them up (neat design, by the way)and fit them into the tight (as in physical, not fashionable) carrying pouch and set them on my dresser.The next day, I have more time to actually use these guys, so I pull them out of the pouch. This is where I need to warn buyers before getting these headphones.THE POUCH IS TOO TIGHT, WHEN YOU PULL THE HEADPHONES OUT, NO MATTER HOW CAREFUL YOU DO IT, ONE OR BOTH OF THE EARPIECES WILL SNAP WHERE IT SWIVELS.[...]UPDATE: NEVER MIND THE WARRANTY IS AMAZING!",5
"For the price, there is simply no other set of headphones that will provide as warm and beautiful a soundspace. It's that simple.",5
"This is my second pair of PortaPro 'phones, and my third pair of headphones using these drivers. They may just be the best headphones I've ever owned- they're not perfect, but they have proven sturdy, they travel well, and they sound great. No kidding; the only headphones I've used that sounded better were the expensive Bose noise-cancelling sort, so I consider this money well spent.Drawbacks: A little pricey. I bought the first pair for under $25 on a competing site, so you might do better with another vendor. The steel band can be a little uncomfortable, but hasn't been for me.Bottom line, these are a great buy and I look forward to using them for a long, long, long time.",5
"I have been wanting a great set of headphones for years and finally took the time to research them and checked with C-net before I purchased anything. I am so glad that I got these, they are so very comfortable (even with brand new ear piercings) and sound incredible. I am also very happy to find out they have a lifetime warranty.",5
My daughter didn't have a nice pair of headphones and we looked these up on Amazon and Cnet loved them so for Christmas I bought them for her. SHE LOVES THEM &#60;3,5
"How often can you really ""feel"" the music? Well, now that is possible with the Porta pro from Koss. Just got mine and they are incredible. Amazing is too short to describe the experience. Highly recommended.",5
"I have had these headphones for 7 years, and the headphones are great.  But more than that, KOSS is amazing.  If there is a short, a problem (and there have been about 4 over the years), they give you a lifetime warranty on the headphones, and have either fixed or replaced them for a nominal charge to cover shipping and handling.  I recommend any KOSS headphones not just because the sound is really good, but because they stand behind their product.",5
"First thing I thought when I heard of these headphones:  really?  people like THESE? They're SO UGLY!Needless to say, I stopped worrying about how good they looked as soon as I heard how good they sounded.  They have amazing bass and the highs and mids are clear without getting distorted or drowned out.  The construction seems flimsy, but as others have pointed out, there is a lifetime warranty on these (although you have to pay for S&H;).  They're light on the head and I can wear them for hours without any fatigue.  However, they are a good amount of sound, so I wouldn't recommend listening to them in quiet areas like libraries or on a commute.  All in all though, I hate to sound cliche: but this really is one of the best headphones for the price.",4
"Fit only so-so, pressure adjustment flimsy. Sound quality very good but not outstanding; sound leaks very noticeable.",4
"I've had these wonderful phones for three months. I use them for my ipod classic. The sound is rich and full. Strong bass with no distortion, even at high levels. Listening to Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" makes the song sound like a dream. You can hear Stevie make sighs and sounds you don't hear on the cheap ipod earbuds.And when you listen to Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick,"" it feels like you're sitting right next to John Bonham as he pounds on the drums.It's unbelievable how good these phones are. When you listen to the Counting Crows' acoustic version of ""Amiee,"" with its mandolin intro playing in the left ear, and rich acoustic guitar coming through on the right ear, you will have an eargasm, baby! It is an experience!The Portapros are also, hands down, THE most comfortable headset I've ever worn. You can adjust them to fit tighter or more loosely around the ears, and the extra padding really helps with the comfort.I should say that these are not noise cancelling or sound isolating. I can't wear them in bed at night because even with the volume 1/3rd up on the ipod, my wife can hear them. Same thing with riding the train or bus. You won't want to wear them in public, partly because they look like something worn on the set of the 1984 flick Tron, and partly because your neighbors won't want to listen to your music.But if you care about excellent quality sound, and you are not disturbing anyone, these are THE best sounding headphones you can buy under $50. They are a BIG step up from the so-so ipod earbuds and a bigger step up from anything Walmart sells.I should say that these sound better on MP3 players than they do on Hi-Fi equipment. I definitely prefer my beloved Grado SR125s for listening with my stereo or with my laptop.But the Portapros are a steal at $38.I almost forgot to mention that there is a lifetime warranty on the Portapros. If they accidently break, and you still have your receipt, Koss replaces them for free. Awesome!",5
I have Bose acoustic noise cancelling headphones which i paid $150 while this Koss Headphones I paid $25 ( black friday deal ). I can say I love this headphone way more than Bose. 100% recommended.,5
"I bought this item after going through so much research. I was interested in this because it is in CNET's top 5 and so many good reviews in Amazon. So I don't think one more elaborated review is not necessary but I want to focus on some issues specifically.1)comfort: I bought a sony MDR-XB500 (for it's extreme comfort and good sound quality) after I buying Koss PortaPro thinking that Koss is pressing my ears too hard because, my ears were paining after listening for couple of hours. Afterwards I noticed that pain is not because of the pressing alone but because of the high bass from KOSS. If you listen at little less volume it shouldn't be a problem.2)Mechanical issues: There are glides on the Headphone for light and Firm wear but when I put them in light mode they just don't stay there. They come to firm position once I touch the phones. One more thing, unless you pull the metal bands to the end they try to collapse. This is not an annoying problem for me because I have a big head. Slowly my ears are used to this, and I can listen for longer times and I am listening at low sound levels. So I changed my decision to return these and I am keeping them.Just to list the Pros and Cons I experienced.Pros: Best sound quality, light weight, portable, extra bass (you love it),Cons: Design not up to the mark, Mechanical issues like glides not staying in their position. Extra bass (You can hurt your ears).",5
"Suits my needs almost perfectly.  A great balance of quality construction, design, price and sound.  All that and a life time warranty from a company with a solid reputation.  I love these headphones.",5
"Probably not fair to compare these to my last set which were PX100s and cost considerably more, so I won't do that, cause PX100s they're not. That said they are decent enough for the price. I was a bit spectacle on how comfortable they would be since I shave my head and these have no pads, but they fit fine, stay on my head and are comfy enough.They produce decent sound although somewhat muddy and not as crisp as the PX100s for sure. But since they are mainly for the time I spend on the stair master at the gym, the sound quality is more than adequate. They block most of the background noise, but I can still hear a bit of what's going on around me which is not a bad thing.As for portability, they fold up small enough, but not small enough to fit easily in the carry bag that is provided, which is pretty much useless. Without it, it's a pain since I keep them in a pocket of my gym bag and without some sort of small carry bag the cord easily gets tangled. For some reason it wants to maintain the original coiling it had in the packaging. Hopefully over time it will straighten a bit. Not a big deal though and I can make do with some other bag for storing them.How well they hold up is yet to be seen. I'm pretty hard on my headphones and have yet to have a pair last more than two years. They look solid enough but I have my doubts. For the price though, it's not a big deal.Overall I am happy with the purchase and would say the rating on these is about right.",4
"I'm a live sound engineer. I have many pairs of headphones. I love these for personal listening with MP3 players, phones, portable digital audio devices. Great for travel. I've purchased several of these. They sound way better than you'd think.....",5
"Not being familiar with the Koss brand I was hesitant to order these headphones but with all of the consumer reviews being four stars and higher I decided to buy a pair. They are small, what you would expect from a cheap portable set. However, the sound blows me away. I hear every little nuance of the music. The bass is very present, the highs are crisp and clear. Well done Koss! They are comfortable to wear, easy to get a good fit with minimal adjustments. They do seem fragile, only time will tell. Get a pair, hear for yourself. I'm quite surprised and very happy with mine.",5
"I've worn out two pair of these phones in the last decade. The sound quality was great. Wonderful bass--the only phones with  better have been phones that fully cover my ears--and aren't really &quot;portable.&quot; These stayed comfortable for the excruciatingly long flights from SoCal to northern Norway, even while wearing glasses. They fold up nice and small, easy to tuck away. They also performed adequately while watching airline movies ... more than saved the price of the phones over several trips!I have two complaints: 1) hair easily penetrates the &quot;speaker grill&quot; and makes irritating noise against the actual speaker membrane. 2) The speaker, while reproducing sound well, can develop tears in the membrane easily. BE CAREFUL! Nothing is more annoying than a buzzing speaker at 33,000 feet (well, perhaps sudden cabin depressurization ...)!My second pair wore out about the same time as my vintage walkman. I replaced the setup with a Nomad II MG &amp; a pair of noise cancelling headphones--they make a _huge_ difference!Five stars for sound quality. Five stars for comfort. Five stars for portability. Five stars for durability. If you're not going to spring for noise cancellation and you need a folding pair of phones, then get a pair of PortaPros.",5
"I own 9 pairs of headphones and several more have been and gone.By far, the PortaPros are my favourite for portable music. Long walks with the dogs, bike riding, train travel, plane travel.The sound these little babies pump out belies their size. Truly excellent acoustics for such a small package.Not many companies these days offer a lifetime guarantee. Says a lot about this product.Some people are unsure of the retro look. I for one love it. They're unique in that regard, but at the end of the day, it's all about the sound and that's where these headphones excel.Do yourself a favour and get some.",5
"I know there are a million great reviews for these phones. I'm speaking directly to Longevity now.I got Koss PortaPro phones ages ago, I think I got mine in 1998. Seriously: I bought them specifically for listening to FTP- begotten MP3 files before I found Napster.These were the best phones I ever found, for these three reasons:1) They aren't monitors, so I can hear humans in my vicinity calling my name. Ear goggles would not allow that.... When my kids are sleeping, and I need to hear any cries in the night, this is critical. Also I could use them at work.2) They provide excellent response range, and I assessed this in my 20's, when I could still hear over 20MHz.3) And now, I swear to you FOURTEEN YEARS LATER, I'm listening to the same phones, and still loving the sound quality.  I've had to replace the pads, I've long since lost the case, but these are the phones hanging atop my computer monitor for when I want good sound quality with my netflix streaming. The metal has not even a blemish.... FWIW, I have not had to replace the temple pads. For some reason those have not deteriorated. I don't get it, logically they should've.Anyway, whenever my kids break these, I will buy another pair, with unreserved exuberance.aside: Koss also OEMs some of the headphones for Radio Shack. I had a much less favorable experience with those phones. You should stick with the brand-name version. Apparently even the Koss factory is capable of producing crap for an OEM job.",5
"The Koss PortaPro Headphones are extraordinarily portable, as they fold and slide into an small extremely space.  However, they NEVER retain the tension setting or head band size that you set for best fit between uses (even when not folded) due to design limitations.  They also tend to become uncomfortable to wear after a short period of time at any setting.  If you do NOT need portability as your overriding choice factor, you can do MUCH better with other Koss headphone models or other top rated brands... so keep looking.",3
"I'd been looking for some comfortable, affordable headphones that provide great sound and came across the reviews for these Koss PortaPro Headphones. The reviews do not lie...these are absolutely perfect for my purposes.I use these with my MP3 and PMP players, as well as my Blackberry Curve if I'm listening to music on it, and have found the sound to be phenomenal.  Now, I'm no audiophile but these definitely give me more detail than previous headphones I've owned so I'm very happy with them.  They are also extremely comfortable...I needed some over-the-head phones because I've always found earbuds and over-the-ear phones to be painful after awhile (I wear glasses, which are a definite factor).  These have been very comfortable on my ears and I can wear them for hours.  I have not had the hair catching issue that some people mention, so I've been lucky with that as well.Definitely worth the price, and if they ever break down I know Koss will provide me with a new pair.  I know they may look a little strange, but I've never had people comment on that - they just want to know if they are good and what kind they are.The only con is I wish the wire to connect to my devices was a little longer - not a lot, but just a few inches to provide a little extra give.  However, most headphone wires are WAYYY too long, so this is a very minor con.These are not noise-cancelling phones, and they were not purchased for use on planes (I have some foam ear buds I use for that purpose) so I can't comment on how they would work in that situation - I think too much noise would definitely get through.  So just use these in everyday situations (walks, in cars when others are driving, etc.) where it is actually a good thing to hear some of what is going on around you for safety purposes.All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend these headphones to anyone.",5
"I bought a pair for my family computer 5 years ago. Aside from replacing the ear pads once in the 5 years - they have sounded phenomenal and have provided years of good and satisfying use!  The independent reviews speak for themselves. Allow me to put it this way: Koss does not make many models of headphones,have been pulled out of bankruptcy in the 80's because of these headphones, and have not changed the design since their introduction in 1984. With that said, these headphones keep the company profitable - so let that be a testament of how good they are. Furthermore, companies do not change their designs if they struck gold - look at the German car makers and American muscle. They have not changed, have the same accents, and characteristics because you don't fix things that are not broken.Sound Quality:I bought AKG Q460s and they were horrible for the price. I had to sell those nightmares off to buy these. It served me right for considering anything but Koss. After hearing such bad headphones I missed the PPs because I am currently away. I needed these to remind me of home. These sound very well balanced, have great bass, and crisp mids, and lighter treble. I think that bass heads will not like these, but will nonetheless appreciate the sound quality and accuracy of these fairly neutral headphones. They do let in/out sound as they are padded and open air, but they are good for quieter environments and very comfortable. The open airs are better because the diaphragm vibrates freely which makes the bass sound less punchy and boxy. These are also very warm headphones with a presence of mids.Pros: Great sound and lifetime warranty.Cons: They are a little awkward because of the metal band, but you will get over it when you hear how good they are.If you are buying online and don't have the time to test them. Just buy these. It's a no brainer. These are the most liked and most reviewed headphones for a reason. If reviews don't convince you - I don't know what will!",5
"I've been saying for years that these are the best headphones you can buy for under $100. That might not be correct, though... You may have to go up to $250 to find cans as good as these. For the price, they simply cannot be beat. They are light, super-comfortable, and they sound great. The only downside to these headphones is that if you fold them up and wrap the cord around frequently, the cord *will* break. It's not even a matter of ""if"", it's a matter of ""when"". I've gone through 4 or so pairs of these things. They're cheap though, so it doesn't bother me.",5
"I love these, they are the best head phones on the market in my opinion. Great sound, cheap, lifetime warranty.As an example: I sometimes use these when I edit movies, while others usually wear these really big and expensive ones from Sennheiser or Sony. One day some guy came over and almost laughed at me for using such small head phones, so I let him give it a try, and he was really impressed.The sound is nice and crispy, plays low mid and high tones equally well. I listen to black and death metal and these work really well for that.",5
"You really can't beat the sound of the headphones for the price. They fit really well, sound amazing, look sweet and rival higher end headphones. I am going to pick up a set for work and home. Even though they are portable, I still forget them. :)",5
"I own several pairs of headphones and earbuds, ranging in price from $20 to over $500.  I've had a pair of these Koss PortaPro headphones for several months now, and used them on PCs for games and on an iPhone and an iPad for games, music and video.  These headhones have great sound with all the devices.  I like them so well that I just ordered 2 more pair.  It would be hard to beat them for the price.",5
"I purchased these after reading many reviews and was not disappointed.  They do not have the best high range, but decent.  Great mid range and surprisingly good low end for the size and style.  They performed so well, that my 16 year old nephew ended up confiscating them as his.  When I called him out on the retro style, he shrugged and said &#34;have you heard these?&#34;  Enough said!",5
"The sound of these cans is good but there are others that are its equal that have some better ergonomics.  The ergonomics are good once you get them on, but the headband and the ""Tension Adjustment"" for the earpads are fiddly.  I find that the Sennheiser PX-100 or the AKG K420 offer equal performance with better usability and similar comfort.",4
"Comfortable, sturdy, & decent sound. I certainly would buy other Koss products & I rec'd this one for those of us who can't wear those uncomfortable ear buds.",5
"I am very pleased with these headphones.  They produce great sound, are light weight and adjustable, and fold to a very compact size.My only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack (which is very rarely found) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks (which are required for using these headphones on an airplane).  I couldn't even find an adapter at Radio Shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only.  Oh well, otherwise they're great.",5
"When I wear headphones I have them on for hours.  I needed a pair of headphones to replace a pair of old sony MDR 20s...similar to sony v100s.Ok the speaker diaphrams on the Koss Porta Pros are very good.The problems I have with the Koss porta pros is the comfort.  The ear pads are smaller than most peoples ears. So the ear pads rest on the inner ridges of your ears, combine this with a spring headband that naturally wants to curl up will provide just enough tension to irritate your ears within 2 hours.The position locks on the sides of the headband do not LOCK in any way, you pick up the headphones with one hand and the earpieces flip to the inside of the headband.The cable is a little short and quite flimsy.Summary...sound good but not too comfortable.BETTER Choice  Sennheiser HD 201...full cup, great sound $20",3
"Outstanding bass while keeping everything else clean, at an incredible low price; and confortable !",5
"Sound quality: Decent. Comfort: Not good, but bearable. Travel Durability: Abysmal. Like, I went on one trip and one of the earpieces broke off at the cheap plastic pins that hold it on to the frame. I had a pair of Sony's that I owned for three years and went on twenty trips with no problem. Eventually the cord got frayed and I had to replace it with this piece of garbage. Maybe I just had bad luck. Probably not though. On my flight back, sitting between fat hick who decided to invade my seat space with passive aggressive knee touching which doesn't work with my crusty former Marine mentality (I turned that row into a warzone with that idiot) and a neurotic aged Woody Allen type who had diarrhea of the mouth and couldn't shut up I reached for my trusty noise killers. Only to discover to my horror that the cheap P.O.S. had broken. If somebody's little Damien had been wailing behind me like my last trip it would have been unbearable.",1
"I have had Koss headphones in the past, Pro 4AA and QZ-99.  The Koss Portapro is portable AND has great bass response.  The work great with my Android phone and can be ""rolled up"" to be carried in my motorcycle jacket or computer bag without getting crunched.  They are very light and do not feel heavy or bear down on your ears even after listening to music with them on all day.  The sound is night and day better than any ear-bud could be and are almost as good as the Pro 4AA.  They are ""open air"" headphones so you cannot match the bass to the sealed types, but it comes close. For $32, you cannot go wrong.",5
"Sound great for the price and size. Very portable, very sturdy, and very cheap. 5 star worthy on that alone.Lots of bass, not the best bass but it is fun to listen too sometimes. The low end is definitely exaggerated but not like other reviews would have you believe.Mids are good, a little lifeless but very god to listen too on the go. Accuratish, and they aren't over emphasized.The highs, ehn. Well again they aren't great but they really do sound nice, if that makes sense. They aren't perfect and at times sound a little slow but these aren't $200 can either, they can be had for $25 if you know when to buy.Value:  10/10 Nothing in this price range competes.Build Quality: 8/10 Very well built but not indestructible.Sound Overall: 7/10 There are better portable phones.Sound Value  : 10/10Overall rating: 9/10I can't give 4.5 stars so I give it 5.On a side note my pair weren't like the picture, more like the best buy pair in one of the buyers note pictures.",5
"I had a pair of Sennheiser headphones that had about a 100 dollar price tag that broke.  These were around 30 dollars and are comparable set of headphones if your looking to save a little money.  Granted I think the Sennheiser were a little better, but you cannot beat these at this price point.  They defiantly pickup on the lower range bass sounds quite well.  Where I think these headphones slightly lack is the midrange, and some fine detail that you get on a nice set of headphones, but that's expected at this price.",5
"These are a bit awkward to put on at first but I assume you get used to that. From the moment you have them on, listen to music and think you are using a $350 pair of headphones. The sound quality is simply outstanding and outright unbelievable that anyone could produce something like this and sell it for this price. I just got mine and simply felt compelled to get off my bum and write a review - they are that good. They do leak a bit of sound so I would refrain from using them to listen to hard rock in a funeral (the look may also be a bit of a giveaway) but other than that - they are simply unbelievable. Highly recommended. As far as the comparison to the PX100 - my wife has those (these were a replacement for my pair that I gave someone as a present) and the sound quality of the Koss is far better.",5
"For the cash you can't get better. Plus: clear sound, low power consumption, comfy pads Minus: not really collapsible, hard to adjust firmness buttons, hair gets caught in band (and I have very short hair). Mated with Cowon's I7, you'd think a fortune was spent for the amazing sound. Not suggested for devices lacking a graphic equalizer-- top treble can get harsh without modification with higher volumes. Glad I purchased the oldie but goodie.",4
"Sure, these headphones aren't exactly comparable to top of the line Sennheisers or other expensive head phones but for the reasonable price I got just what I wanted, a lightweight bass prone pair of head phones that with the right eq on my Ipod actually sounds very good. I carry these with me for my travels where they serve as movie and music headphones and they do a great job. Would I want to take a more audiophile approach I would turn to a pair of HD 598's or similar, but these do just what they're supposed to do.Really like 'em!",4
"Yep. An old classic. No styling changes for 20-plus years. But they got it right the first time. Very lightweight and excellent sound. I use Grados for my serious listening, but these are just super for portable use. Probably why they call them 'PortaPro.' Only complaint, the top band is a little tweeky and thin. A wider band would render these bad boys perfect. Can't do better for the bucks though. Happy listening!!!!!",4
"So I was in the market for a great pair of phones. Was looking at some grados, but they are pricey. So when I found these I was a bit surprised at the specs to cost ratio. Must say the look and feel great, and the sound quality is just fantastic. Would definitely recommend!",5
"For the price it sells it's not worth it, even you can fold them, and they have a good bass sound.I decided to keep it, but would not reccommend it unless the price is $ 10.Purchased different Koss model, much happier now, keeping both pairs.",3
"Absolutely amazing sound quality for the price.  At first, they may sound a bit bass-heavy compared to other headphones, but once you get used to it, it sounds great.  Powerful and full sound.  I find them super comfortable on the firm setting, but I have a narrow head I think.  The additional foam pads on the temple really help the comfort level.  They fold up fairly small but it's hard to fit them in the leather bag provided.  I wish they came with a hard case for true protection while traveling.A great product which I would definitely buy again.",5
"My very first set of headphones (purchased in 1970) were a set of Koss Pro 4AA.  They were heavy, rugged and sounded great when plugged into my Kenwood receiver. Thirty-six years later, the 4AA's still sound great, but are not at all portable.The earbuds that came with my iPod sound allright, but lack bass response.  I tried a set of Sony EX-51 earbuds.  Better bass, but uncomfortable.After much research, I decided to give the PortaPros a listen.  Actually, I would have loved to have found a retailer who carried the PortaPros so I could listen to them before purchasing, but having no luck at the local ""big box"" retailers, I decided to purchase the head phones via the internet and audition them at home.No dissapointment.  These are a quality set of cans.  Great sound, great price, and a lifetime warranty as well.",5
"These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.",5
"I've been using them for almost a year now. Sound is very good, not fabulous.  Could be a bit crisper and have more presence.  If you like bass, this is your set- awesome (too much for my taste, really).  Nice not to have to stick anything inside your ear. Pops open too easily when folded up.  Sometimes pulls at your hair when resizing it on your head.  An earpad has popped out of its socket a couple of times, but it pops right back in- seems fragile but is more durable than it looks.  Adjusting tabs on each side reset when you take if off your head.  Consider whether you would rather have noise-canceling or inline volume adjuster before you decide. If not, it's a good choice and a good value.May 2010 update: I had one of the cords pull out of the earpiece and sent it back to the company for a replacement- only paid shipping. They sent me a new unit. It's cheap, it's good, and it's a keeper in my book, even 5 years later.Feb. 2012 update: Still going strong.Mar. 2013 update: keeps going, and going...",4
"I work at an office and I wear headphones ~ 30 hours per week. And let me say that I have tried them ALL. Everything from earbuds to on-ear, and even over the ear headphones.A friend of mine suggested the PortaPros to me. At first I was turned off because of the way they looked, but I decided to take a chance. Once I got them on I think they look cool, and my fianc&eacute; calls them my 'Tron' headphones. I have actually grown to like the retro, 80's look.But on to the sound.. They sound AMAZING. I won't even say 'for the price'. They just sound great. I needed a headphone that were 'open air', that way I can still hear my coworkers around me. These are on-ear, 'open air' design, but don't let that fool you. They have GREAT bass response and sound crystal clear, no matter what the volume is. Keep in mind I work in a pretty quiet environment, so I am not sure how they'd hold up on a busy city bus.The fit is also GREAT. They are SO adjustable. It took me a few days to find just the right fit, but now that I have I will never go to any other headphone for day-to-day use. I have a great pair of Sony 7506's for podcasting / studio environment, but these are so great for work and travel. The way they fold up is genius, and Koss even included a nice little pouch to store them in.All in all, I give it an A! The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 stars is because that the cord is just a BIT too short. Other than that, these headphones are a completely solid investment!",4
"First of all, unless you have a huge fetish for retro, 80's looking headphones, these headphones will not be pretty. They were created in the 80's, and because they got such a great response, the company hasn't changed anything about them - including the design. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that the sound quality that comes out of these is absolutely amazing. For the price that you're paying (about 30 bucks), these things are 100% worth the money. They appear a little flimsy, but it's pretty incredible the sound you get when you plug these things in. They also come with a larger plug for other equipment that requires it, which was really convenient for me since I got to use them for my keyboard which requires a 1/4"" stereo plug instead of a 1/8"". Furthermore, they're really not that fragile. I accidentally got my set jammed in my desk and popped off one of the side headphones, but it just snapped right back in and I haven't had any problems. They also have a lifetime warranty in case anything DOES happen to them, which is always a plus. Definitely a great investment.",5
"Bought my set back in 2008, still working as I type this. The only thing to buy with it is Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions and 6ft&#34;Aurum Cables 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Female Stereo Audio Extension Cable on Amazon also.",5
Definitely one of the best sounding headphones under $50! Well worth the money. Just that it might pinch your hair.,5
No longer use wired headphones as I have totally switched over to blue tooth headphones.  I couldn't deal with the messy wires. They worked well but they are in the pile of stuff for my local church to sell.,5
"Pretty good sound, I like more bass and these are balanced.  Ipod touch powers them just fine.",4
Everyone is surprised by the awesome sound when I have them listen to these. I use them regularly at the office as well as when I travel. They collapse well for travel.,5
These are not what I expected based on the reviews I read & price paid.  They are on the flimsy side IMO & do not sound any better than most other cheaper & flimsy headphones I've tried.  If I had to do it over again & would have spent more & bought some Grados.,2
"I didn't know much about this brand called 'Koss'. I just simply bought this since they looked very portable, light-weight, cool, and contain some bass. Apparently, this headphone almost sounds as good as my 200 dollar Beats by bull(___) HD.For a price of 40 and the incredibly small size, this headphone is simply amazing. Bass is reasonable enough, though some House music, metal, or dubstep can make the bass sound all mixed-up and rather disgusting than clear; however, if you want some clear bass you might wanna look at headphones around 300-400 or even higher :). Other than that, I didn't find any part of its sound quality less than I expected. Besides, I didn't even expect any bass to be in this tiny headphone!I use this whenever I am doing some exercise, and so far I find no need to buy another earphone or a light-weight-on-ear headphone.Great job Koss, I just simply love this. XD",5
"This is one of those ""must-have"" headphones that you can use as a reference to compare other headphones with.  It's the best in its class and beats many other headphones that are way more expensive.This headphone require some breaking-in period (at least 40 hours), otherwise you may find the bass to be overpowering and fatiguing, as I did at first.  I put the headphone in continuous play through an amplifier for over 40 hrs non-stop at med-high volume.  Now they sound better-- less fatiguing and more ""laid back,"" as the audio geeks would say.If you want more portability, try the cheaper Koss KSC-50.  They are clip-ons but sound almost the same as the PortaPros.  I said almost, because the PortaPros are punchier and have more defined bass.",5
"I loved the headphones when I first got it. But the annoyances didn't take long to appear. And they all have nothing to do with the audio quality of this product.The headphones will pull your hair, no matter how short it is. I trimmed my hair down to half a centimeter and the bands still manage to somehow yank on it. Very annoying! So as long as you are bald or intend to use these over a cap, you should be fine. Otherwise, stay away.Secondly, I have an issue with the durability of the cable/cord on the connector. I used this on my ipod touch for not even a whole month and the rubber had tore off. I had to use some electrical tape over that part to keep the cord from further damage. Although they have an unconditional lifetime warranty, I have not gotten around to sending these back for a replacement yet.",3
"We bought many of these for Christmas for the kids (tablets, iPods, laptops, PCs) and the noise level in the house thanked us.The sound quality is astounding, considering the price.  These FAR outperform anything that says BEATS on it, at a tiny fraction of the price (our very brand conscious son actually bought and immediately returned a $300 pair after using these).The sound is, again, spectacular.The comfort, however, is less than stellar (the steel band hurts the top of their heads after a while), and they do cause some pretty ugly hair tangles for the girls.  For intermittent use, they're fine - but in long sessions, they have been associated with frequent whining.The only real downside we've found is that the cords are outrageously frail.  One yank (trip or snag related), and they're toast.  The conductors are SO tiny that repair almost requires microsurgical procedures.  It can be done, but you'll need a jeweler's eyepiece, tiny fingers and a lot of patience.Forewarned is forearmed.",4
"I searched a long time for a set of portable headphones.  I had a set of in ear bugs and although they were great my ears would hurt after wearing them.  The Koss phones are very portable and have amazing sound for the price.  Many people said that the bass was to much but I found that for the music I listened to it was very rich and supportive to the rest of the music.  One problem is that when they retract or pull apart, your hair can get caught in them.  These are also not noise cancelling phones so that you will hear a lot of external sound.  For me I wear them sometimes when driving so that works perfect for me.  I would recommend them as being really a good buy for the price if you are looking for a portable non noise cancelling headphone.",5
"use it all the time on the subway.  it's been used for over 2 years.  just becareful of rolling up the cord.  after a while it could lose some of it's connectivity at the head socket if your'e too rough with it, but luckily it has a lifetime warranty.",5
"I have had a pair of Koss PortaPro headphone since they came out about 20 years ago.  They are the best. I believe they were once top-rated by CU.  They have wonderfull bass, clear sound, are comforable to wear.  They are low priced.  They have a life-time warrenty for $6 S&H repair or replacement by Koss.  How may other headphones have this?  You will be very happy with the PortaPro.",5
Simply the best inexpensive headphone on the market. Hard to believe they first appeared 20+ years ago and they still can't be beat.,5
"Out of the box these sounded a little odd, but after letting them burn in over night the sound is very smooth. The bass was ok I thought, until a really heavy bass note hit and these things showed a little more power, and much deeper bass. The build could of been better, but for a pair of on ear headphones I wasn't expecting the heaviest build, these are about just as durable as most sets of on ear. However these come with a life time warrenty. These do start to hurt my ears eventually, I keep the comfort setting to light, so I can get more hours out of these in comfort. I can say I have a set over over ear headphones which sound better then these, but also cost 4 times as much. For walking around, on the go, these are great, they sound good, light weight, but dorky looking. None the less i am a college nerd, so I guess it works out for me.",5
"The space between the speaker and the temple rest is too small and it hurts the ears.If you have big ears or a big noggin, don't get these.",2
"Unbeliveable (until you hear them) quality for the price!I'm a musician but not much of an audiophile, tho I'd wager my hearing is slightly above average.  The amount of richness (esp base) was surprising - i couldn't believe my laptop (usually very sub-par sound) and Rio Karma (as compared to the Sennheiser MX300 earbuds) could output such quality tones.  My brother recommended these (he has perfect pitch and much better ears than me), as he uses these during his commute instead of his Grado SR 125's which were getting beat up and aren't nearly as comfortable as the Koss PortaPros.  Though obviously not anywhere as 'elite' as Grados or Beyers, I find it impressive that these are an adequate replacement for his Grado's. Additionally, the tension adjustment is a really nice feature, and the cushioning arrangement works great for people who wear glasses.  Additionally, they look really snazzy with the metallic blue accents.",5
"I was going to reorder another set of Sennheiser PX-100-II because the cord started to short out at the plug-in point. I like using open air headsets at the office and while taking the pooch for a walk so that I can be aware of what&#8217;s going on around me. Just when I was about to click &#8220;add to cart&#8221;, I noticed the suggestion at the bottom featuring the Koss PortaPro Headphones. I immediately remember these guys from back in the SONY Walkman days! Upon further reading reviews I decided to go for them and here&#8217;s what I think after a good amount of usage (I like to &#8220;grade&#8221; my product reviews). Hope this helps.LOOKS: 7.5 -OK, I must admit that at first I thought they looked very retro and had a nostalgic feel to them. However, as I put them on and looked at myself in the mirror, I started to feel a bit awkward and &#8220;dorkish&#8221;. That sensation intensified as I walked down the street and noticed people giving me weird looks. Honestly, I really didn&#8217;t care, but noticed it nonetheless.BUILD: 8.0 &#8211; These headphones seem well constructed. However, the thinness of the headband, which is made of an aluminum strap, is a concern. I wouldn&#8217;t want to overly bend it for sure. There are also a lot of moving parts and the ear plates are made of plastic. I would not advise to step or even sit on them. The cable is rather thin but overall, if you treat them with respect, they should be able to last and the lifetime warranty puts me at ease.COMFORT: 10.0 &#8211; Hands down he PortaPro&#8217;s are easily the most comfortable headsets I&#8217;ve worn in a long time! They&#8217;re super light so you&#8217;d hardly think they are on your head. The ear pads can feel a bit strange when first putting them on, but quickly become seamless. And they feature a slide to ease pressure, just in case. They are more comfortable and secure on my head than my old PX-100&#8217;s.SOUND: 10.0 &#8211; I proudly own several types of headphones from Audiotechnica, to Bose, to Sony and even lesser known, great quality brands. I love sound (don&#8217;t consider myself an audiophile) so I don&#8217;t take my listening lightly. These little guys provide outstanding performance for the money! The open nature of these headsets provides a very wide, warm, natural feel to whatever you&#8217;re listening to. The highs are very clear and do not &#8220;bleed&#8221; into the other frequencies. The mids are very distinctive and present. The bass is &#8220;punchy&#8221; without being overwhelming (my PX-100&#8217;s were a bit too bassy). I can listen to all genres, from rock, to hip hop to classical and equally enjoy them without adjusting the equalizer setting (flat response). Live music is definitely a pleasure to hear with these guys.FUNCTIONALITY: 9.0 &#8211; Carrying them around is rather easy. They fold into a small, tight &#8220;ball&#8221; and they fit into a little pouch provided by Koss. Getting them into this position is easy and intuitive. They fit into any bag without taking too much space. The cord is light weight and of good length. I wish the 8mm plug was bent 90 because I put my portable device in my back pocket and sticks out a bit. One little gripe that most have is that when placing them on your head, the auto-adjust process happens automatically and you hair can get caught in the sliders. Ouch! But fortunately, that doesn&#8217;t happen too often. They don&#8217;t leak sound as much as I thought they would and that&#8217;s a plus.OVERALL: 8.9 &#8211; I am a believer now! While I do not use these for commuting (subway trains) because of the inability to block out sound, the Koss PortaPros have become the go-to headset to beat while walking around the neighborhood with my dog. The sound quality and comfortableness more than make up for the hit-or-miss retro looks. Highly Recommended.",4
"These headphones provide the best bang for your headphone dollar. For a sub $40 price, you can get a headphone that is better than twice its price. But it is not better than most premium headphones that cost over $200.The bass, which was great by 80s standards, can't handle the lower frequencies as well as high end Shure earphones. Otherwise, there is very little distortion of the sound.The level of detail in the sound is impressive. I did hear many sounds (mainly percussion instruments and background guitar music) which I couldn't hear with my inferior iPod headphones. But again, the level of detail is not as good as Shure earphones.If you are on a budget and want to replace your uncomfortable and inferior iPod headphones with something superior, then this headphone is great. Unless you want to look retro 80s, however, you may want to wear them inside.",4
"I keep hearing about this little headphone that I just had to try it.  When the opprtunity came up for me to purchase a small headphone, I jumped on it.There are countless reviews here describing about PortaPro.  So I will skip most of things mentioned here.  I will just focus on my experience with it.First of all, Koss was not a known brand for me.  Only time I really saw their product was when I went to Thrifty (now Rite Aid) and saw their cheap earphones in their electronic section.  Naturally, I always thought they just make cheap quality products.  In last year or so, I started looking for a budget price headphone with good sound quality.  And this product kept popping up in reviews and people's recommendations.  I was intrigued by the fact that this product is essentially unchanged since it's launch in the mid 80's.For $25-$35 price range headphone, I am not so sure if there are better headphones.  It sounds just amazing.  Very full and rich low and mid sound (not muddled but clear and balanced).  Highs are not as strong but it is very well balanced with the rest of the sound range.Build quality is just average.  I don't mean it's badly assembled or anything like that.  But even by mid 80's standard, parts used are extremely minimalistic.  Some people commented on the metal adjustable band constantly shifting and not locking in its position.  Basically, it is not designed to ""lock"" into one position.  If you take your headphone off, you will have to readjust the length of the metal band.Another bad thing is that you just look silly wearing this thing.  But I think once you hear the sound quality, you won't mind wearing it.Again, for the price, I don't think you can beat it.*Update:  I LOVE THIS HEADPHONE!  :)",5
This is the second pair of Koss Porta Pros I have purchased (wire started shorting out after a few years of repeatedly dropping my ipod). Sound quality is great for the price.  They are comfortable to wear.  What more can you expect.,5
"Better sound than I expected for the price I paid. They collapse easily, take up little space, and I don't have to shove them in my ears, which is nice.",5
"I bought a pair of these a few years ago based on their popularity and stellar reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. I bought a second pair to keep handy in my basement with my home theater system for when it's late and I don't want to wake up my wife while watching a loud movie. These are very comfortable to wear (as opposed to earbuds, which I can't stand and are generally weak on sound), and I haven't owned or used a pair of headphones that sound as good as these, including some $100 closed-ear models. The sound is clear, with the right balance of bass and treble. A lot of headphones do not have enough bass, or if they do, the overall sound is muffled. These find the right balance, and sound great for music or movies. And at this price, I doubt you could beat it.",5
"Synposis: Good sound quality, relatively comfortable, and can be registered for a lifetime warranty with Koss. Not much else that can be asked for from a set of headphones at this prices range.The sound quality and comfort are both fairly exceptional, although it should be noted that they let a lot of sound leak both in and out courtesy of their design. On the other hand for a traveling headphone of light build, that isn't always a problem. The lifetime warranty should be noted as well. I had to use it once because one of the sides went dead, but they replaced the set and I'm back to enjoying them.",4
"I have recently realized that I am what some like to refer as an ""audiophile.""  I've always loved good sound reproduction, excellent sound range as well as quality.  When I was younger, I used to buy Koss pretty much exclusively.  Lately though, I've been somewhat disappointed though with a few exceptions, the Koss PortaPro being at the top of the list!These headphones have been around since I was a teenager and unlike me, they are still going strong!  They have fantastic sound, they are not overly affected in the bass range (they don't add extra bass for the ""boom boom"" window rattlers out there), they are economical, comfortable and just all around a fantastic buy.  Also, they are recommended by SERIOUS audiophiles as the best portable out there.I can't agree with that entirely; I also recommend the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 depending on your needs.  But of the three, these are the least expensive but offer fantastic sound that you would expect to come out of a pair of full size cans (headphones, I guess I'm learning the audiophile lingo!).The Koss PortaPro have the Comfort Zone temple pads that help make them even more comfortable and the pressure between temple and ear can be adjusted literally by the flick of a switch on ear side of your head.  I have a massive head and these fit me with room to spare.  I like the firmest setting on the Comfort Zone but I've tried the other two settings as well and I can honestly say that there is a difference; it is NOT just a gimmick.  The Comfort Zone really works.These are truly portable also!  They fold up into a little ball that can then be placed into a convenient case that Koss provides.  I personally would recommend buying a semi-hard shell case that Koss also sells just for the extra protection.What more can I say?  If you'd like a few other recommendations in the truly portable range, the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 are rugged, comfortable and highly portable.  (They collapse as well and fit into their own plastic case.)  If you like earbuds, the Sennheiser MX-500 is wonderful with its in-line volume control; the sound is absolutely amazing for something so small.  And finally, the Koss KTXPRO1 is an excellent portable headphone with an in-line volume control.  It uses a Titanium element to drive it.  All of these are great products but ultimately this particular review is about the Koss PortaPro and I really am blown away at how great these tiny portable cans truly are.  I believe you will be too.Though I've become somewhat disillusioned by Koss as I've become a so-called ""audiophile"" (why not just call me someone who really loves good sound to come through good instead of creating a term that sets me apart from everyone else?), I highly recommend these cans to you.  If you are on a budget, you especially can't go wrong.  Remember that Koss guarantees all their cans for life with their ""no questions asked"" guarantee.  It's worth it!  So as my review title states, ""The Koss PortaPro shines in every area.""Oh, one last thing:  Don't listen to people who say these cans are ugly or clunky; they aren't.  The design is what gives the PortaPro its unique sound quality and I personally think they look cool!  Ultimately though, it is the sound that matters, right?  :)",5
"Not a bad pair of headphones at all. Excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum. Once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq. It's defintely high quality bass sound, not muddy, just soft. Extremely comfortable! I just expected these to have better bass response than they did.",3
"I have both the Koss Protapro and Sennheiser PX100 headphones. I love them both! I just bought the Portapros brand new. My PX100 is 5 years old and the mechanicals are wearing out. Here's a comparison between the two.The mechanicals on the PX100 are a notch better than the Portapros. The PX100 has headband padding; the Portapros do not and take a few hairs out now and then. Once placed on your head, both are comfortable. The PX100 folds up neater than the Portapros. The PX100 design is sleeker, more modern and less prominent on your head. The over all construction seems a notch better on the PX100. Here's the interesting thing though. Both are open air but the Portapros seem to seal out external sounds a little better than the PX100. I cannot explain why. The Portapros are also slightly more efficient and play a bit louder.The Sound character of each is a matter of taste. Both headphones sound excellent. Both are sweet, clean and very detailed. Both are non-fatiguing. The Protapros are a bit bass heavy. On some music that bassy sound is magnificent. On other types of music with already prominent bass the PX100 is preferable. Surprisingly, the high frequencies are equally well extended on both headphones. The Portapros are a little sweeter in the high frequencies than the PX100.  The PX100 may be a little more accurate with a slightly better midrange than the Portapros.The PX100 is an up-to-date modern design. The Portapros are classics with a design that goes back 15 years! The original PX100 came with a nice case. The Portapros have a hook and eyelet at the bottom of the metal headband. They hook together to bind them tight to fit inside a small bag. I use neither the bag nor the case. You may want to buy both. You can't go wrong with either.",5
"These are simply awesome. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I do have a few pairs of expensive and sophisticated earphones with super-sonic so and so and ultra-isonalting this and that. They're great and have their uses, but if all you need is a pair of earphones that you can carry in your jacket pocket or laptop bag, you won't find a serious competitor to the PortaPros.They're compact, sturdy, and of reasonable quality. Will you get the same quality as a pro set of headphones? Of course not, but you likely don't need high fidelity if you're on the metro, studying, watching Youtube, or perusing your podcasts.If you need a pair of nifty, retro, collapsible, and decent quality headphones, pick these up.Note that the phones themselves are about the size of an average ear. They will not cover your entire ear.",4
"I've owned a pair of Porta Pro's since 1988.  I have used the Koss lifetime warranty several times in that period, and every time it's been just fine.  On one pair I had even soldered on my own replacement plug, and I called Koss to make sure they would still be covered.  The man on the phone said, ""You could chop them up into a million pieces and mail the pieces to us in a bag, and we'd still send you a replacement set.""  Now that's customer service!Sound Quality:  You will not find anything in this price range that even comes close.  The bass is deeper than you would expect for such a small device, and the highs are clear.  The sound is not fatiguing at all.  I listen to them at the office every day for up to 8 hours and they are brilliant.Comfort:  Since they are open-ear design, they don't make your head sweat.  The metal band can snag your hair occasionally but it's not a major problem.Looks: 80's tastic.  I think that's a plus, your mileage may vary.Value for money: unbeatable.",5
"See title.  Both my wife and I love these, they fit nice, very nice price, look reasonably durable, and the sound range is everything I can hear.  What's not to like?",5
"I'm a headphone nut... I've invested thousands in high-end headphones, DACS, and dedicated amplifiers and I consider myself to be pretty picky. You can trust that I would give a negative review if it was warranted.For the money, you would be hard pressed to find any headphone that sounds better. Good bass without being overstated, highs are clear with good extension, and mid-range isn't harsh (my biggest complaint with headphones under the $200 mark). These have a similar sound signature to my beloved Sennheiser PX100's (not the sub-standard PX100 II (two's) that have replaced that discontinued model) at a similar price point.For anyone looking for good quality sound on a budget, you can't beat these... trust me, I've tried them all!Don't expect much in the way of isolation (blocking outside noise from coming in, or keeping your sounds from coming out) with these, and the sound quality is much more apparent in quiet environments.These don't really need an amplifier for normal listening, but I do find that they require a little more power than my Zune will put out if I'm on an airplane or train.I'd buy these again if lost or stolen.",5
"This is my favorite headset to use around the house. Pros: Light weight, collapsible, adjustable band, good sound, comfortable to wear. (i get tired of using my in-ear phones). It is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundings.",5
"sound effect is good, but I see more negative pt about this product than it's basic feature of good sounds and bass.1) the cover spoilt rather easily, Iucky, I have bought the replacement pack together2) the metal headband and the plastic catch comes off easily, I have to carefully remove from my head as if you had bend it more when removing from your head, the plastic catch will be loose and the headset will be separated into 2. I have to &#34;repair&#34; it a few times..now I am extra careful when removing from my head...3) the cable is way too short! only about 0.5m I think...I am using in on my PC..lucky I have front speaker jack...definately will not be able to fit the back panel speaker jack..",3
Really nice pair of low cost ear phones that do a very decent job. If youu do'nt want to spend a lot of money you get your monies worth with this set.,4
"Excellent sound reproduction.  Comfortable.  Cord just the right length so that I can put my minidisc player in my pocket.  Just one thing that keeps me from giving them 5 starts.  Every time I take them off the metal bands slide so that I have to readjust them every time I put them on again.  A set of headphones like these that stayed the way I set them would get 5 stars.Added in edit:  Amazon lets you edit your reviews, but not your star-rankings.  I'm not changing a word of the text, but having to adjust the headband is proving to be an annoyance.  Lower my star ranking to 3.  From what I gather, there are lots of good headphones out there.  I wouldn't buy another pair of these.",4
"I have owned a lot of low to mid range headphones in my lifetime. Currently, I have a pair of skullcandy earbuds, a pair of the stock iPod earbuds and a pair of $35 Sony Studio headphones (the big over-the-ear ones).They were not working for me. The sound on the Sony ones were pretty decent, but prolonged use made my ears ache and could get very warm in the wrong climate (like...summer). They were also very heavy, so reading text books or just reading my Kindle, these things would not cut it as it would also put strain on my neck. My ears were just not made for earbuds, as I had various problems with those. The iPod earbuds failed miserably, as the sound was always too shallow for me and they kept falling out of my ears.So, I looked for the most rated headphones (not earbuds) with over a 4 star rating on Amazon and stumbled across these. Over a 1000 reviews and it still had 4 1/2 stars? Yeah, I'll take some time to check these out lol.So I got them a week ago. To avoid any ""premature"" reviewing, I let them sit the first three days with music on constantly, racking up about 36-40 hours of ""break in"" time before I tried them out objectively.First the headphones themselves. They are very, very light. The head band are a couple of thin metal bands with plastic pieces that adjust size. I like this because metal is durable but it's also light and airy and doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a music factory on my head.The ear pads are more comfortable than I imagined. They are not dollar store ear pads (although they look that way) and are comfortable on the ears.A wildly awesome thing about these phones that people often overlook are all the parts that make them comfortable. The ear pieces themselves are hinged, so they bend depending on the shape of your ear. The metal bands are firm but flexible so it doesn't press too hard on the head or ears. Then there's comfortzone settings. It took a minute to figure out how the settings work, but once I did I was treated to a unique comfort experience. Comfortzone consists of two pads on either side that rest on the temples. The firmer the settings, the more pressure on your temples and less on your ears. I found this awesome as I could sit with these headphones on my head for 8 straight hours and feel no ear fatigue at all.Now for the part everyone wants to read: the sound. I am NOT an audiophile and I won't use any technical terms. The music sounded just plain great. I can hear bass lines in rock songs, hip-hop and rap songs thump (but not uncomfortably so). The music sounds whole and complete and not shallow and airy like iPod headphones do. The high notes sound good and even at high volumes don't cackle or distort and in no song that I listened to did anything sound muddy or wrong. The volume is well balanced. Maxed out is too loud and that's something my other pairs of headphones can't say. I've often had to max out settings just to get a decent volume on my Sony headphones. These I can keep in the middle volume range and it still sounds good.They're not noise cancelling and they leak sound. I'm okay with this because when I jog, I'd like to hear the cars coming before they hit me ;) so if you're looking for noise cancelling and quiet for others, then you should probably keep searching.All in all, for the price, I can't imagine having gotten a better pair of headphones. Personally, I love the retro style of the headphones. Keep in mind that Chucks have fallen in and out of style for 90 years and they're top sellers. This has been in and out of style for nearly 30 years and it's a top seller. I put them in the same category (and, as it happens, own both now) which is ""totally awesome"". If you're looking for some lightweight phones that sound great and have a unique look, then your search is over. I wish I'd found these 15 years ago when I started using headphones for the first time.",5
"My first PortaPros came with a Koss FM radio I bought in the mid-80s. They never wore out, outlasting the radio by more than a decade, and I eventually misplaced them.  I was thrilled to discover they're still available after all these years.  They're comfortable and durable, and they sound great.  Lifetime warranty, too. Very few products these days avoid obsolescence for a quarter century. The Koss PortaPros are tried and true, and still relevant. Imagine that.",5
"Awesome little headphones, some of the best sounding set I have ever owned. They're a little rough to look at, but I am very glad I gave them a try. These sound terrific, and adjust for your ears with lighter pressure, if you so desire. The only drawback I would see for these has to do with their higher impedance, at 60 ohms, as opposed to a lower impedance for most portables out there. The higher impedance means that batteries would empty quicker when used with mobile gear, but well worth the money for the sound. Amazing product, I will buy a second pair as a back-up.",5
"I bought these on the recommendation of CNET and I wasn't disappointed.  They sound great, and they fold well for easy carrying.  For a non-audiophile (please note that before any other comments)  I didn't hear much difference between several other more expensive sets.  They have a rich sound and I have yet to listen to anything they don't play well.  However there is one HUGE thing that isn't stressed enough here although I did see it mentioned before I purchased mine.  I bought mine to study with and no one will study with me anymore due to the leakage.  These leak a lot.  My wife can hear me listening to lectures and my study partners can hear my music three seats down.  They are great but should not be purchased to listen to in a library.  The hair pulling happens occasionally, but you get past that by putting them on carefully and it isn't a huge hassle.  A little hard for me to get in the carry case also.  I am purchasing another set for study, but let me be clear, I AM KEEPING THESE for all other uses.  I just want to make sure you don't buy these for quiet surroundings.",4
"**Update 9/8/10** These headphones are great but they do have one potentially serious design flaw.  The stereo connector is very flimsy.  Despite being very careful, mine broke in under a year.  The stereo connector literally just pulled apart as I was removing it from the ipod one day.  The wires pulled right out of the connector.  After checking the web, I see I am not the only one to experience this.  Someone was even kind enough to post a picture of it above, in the product photos.  I still think they're great headphones and I ordered a new  pair (although I plan to have these replaced under warranty and keep as a spare).  I knocked off one star simply because now I have to shell out $6 plus shipping to replace this set (although I opted to pay $30 for a new pair to save time).  However, if the second pair breaks as quickly as the first, prepare to watch the review stars plummet.  What good is something if it won't last at least a year?*** End of update ****I've tried pretty much all types of headphones. I was looking for a good solid pair, under $50, preferably over-the-ear but not too big (for gym, athletic use and better portability).  I stumbled across these on the web and saw that people loved them, so I came to Amazon to read some reviews.  Seeing that they were highly rated here as well, I ordered a pair.  These headphones have a solid reputation for a reason, they sound great.  The minute I plugged them in, I knew why they were so highly rated.  Clear highs, deep lows.  I mean, it's not bone rattling bass, but it's decent enough if you don't want to lug around a pair of $50+ self-powered heavy headphones.  Easily the best sounding headphones I've bought the past year.  And that's in a group of Skull Candy, Sony, Apple, self powered, noise canceling... I've tried it all the past year.  The only (extremely minor) gripe I have is that I agree with others that it does feel flimsy at times.  I like that the moving pieces are metal instead of plastic (can't tell you how many plastic headphones I've inadvertently broken from simply putting on and removing), but it still has a somewhat delicate feel to it.  They do come with a lifetime warranty, which is pretty sweet, (although a further check of the terms reveal you pay to ship them back and have to include a $6 check.  Something potential purchasers should be aware of).  I'm happy with my set and agree with everyone else that these headphones come in a portable package but possess full-sized sound.",4
"I shopped alot before I decided on these headphones i read all the reviews here as well as on many other sites. To tell you the truth I found the hype hard to believe for a product that has remained unchanged since the 80's . I rated these babies a 5 star for the sound quality and price it helps if you have a headphone amp if your using small devices to run them like  IPOD but not mandatory they get pretty loud without my amp and probably would protect your hearing better without it. I can tell and improvement with the amp but it sounds really good just plugged straight into the IPOD . I really like these over my VMODA bass earplugs for certain activities like exercise the bass buds sound better on alot of things without the amp especially but if you walk or ride with the buds in your hear the wire rubbing your clothes it amps up your breathing etc. plus if your walking like I do where people bike or drive you cant hear them coming up behind you , not a problem with the porta pros on. I have to point out that you can hear them if your sitting or standing next to someone wearing them so if your listening to somethiing loud and dont want to disturb others around you they dont work well for that like on a plane, bus, in a car so there are some limitations to it. people made alot of issue with the retro style either for or against. In all honesty they really dont look all that odd on your head and are quite comfy the fact that they fold up to carry in the bag is nice but they are still bulkier than a pair of ear buds. alot of people reviewd them as being studio quality monitor headphones this to me seems a bit much but they are definately on par with any headphones I tried while looking for a new set.I even felt they rivaled the bose over ear set although the noise cancelation you get from the cup does make the bose sound better on some stuff. I would say you cant go wrong with this headphone set especially for small devices like IPODS and the like.",5
"I used the Sennheiser PX-100 headphones (very similar in size, price, and style) almost daily for 2 years when one side crapped out. Drat. So I bought the Koss PortaPro's as a replacement.1. The Koss are not as attractive. Not that important to me.2. The Koss are not as comfortable. The metal head band is cheesy, when compared to the Sennheiser's, and they are only $10 more. The Koss are also a tad too tight. My ears burned (even when on the loosest setting) after about 2 hours.3. The BIG problem, and I toyed around with equalizer settings in WinAmp (my MP3 player software of choice), is that the Koss are incredibly easy to overdrive, even at relatively low listening levels. Not so the Sennheiser headphones. Had I noticed distortion with them, I would have chucked them long ago.Summary: If you want a light pair of on-ear, portable headphones, spend the extra $$ and get the Sennheiser PX-100 (or higher models). The Koss may be adequate for portable MP3 devices where you cannot adjust the EQ settings, but for more ambitious use, they are far too inadequate. I'm buying another pair of the Sennheiser's.",1
The build quality seems cheap and all but the sound quality is pretty good. The little pouch that came with it seems nice.,5
"Punchline:I have looked around and can't think of any over-the-ear headphones with a $35 price point which would sound better than Koss PortaPro's.FYI, there is a newer model which has a remote on its cable and supports iOS devices.I remember drooling over these way back in the day when one of my favorite European hi-fi magazines used to use these as a reference for all portable headphones. They deserved it. And although the crown had been taken off these by better headphones as the time went by, PortaPro's have still lot to offer and easily beat other competitors twice the price of these or more. I would not hesitate for a second to put PortaPro's above Dr. Dre's Beats (which are an over priced, mediocre sounding) phenomenon these days.Design:PortaPro's draw attention of onlookers as their signature design does look somewhat nerdy. :-) Fit is great, the temporal pads can adjust their pressure, hence alleviating the pressure put on your ears The bridge is self-adjusting consisting of two pieces sliding on top of each other, though, the plastic sleeves on top of the bridge can push into the top of your head and if you have less hair, you may feel it after awhile. Also, if you have long hair, or lots of it (not my problem), your hair could get snagged between the bridge pieces and get pulled.Cable is oxygen-free, has a 45 degree angled 3.5mm jack and splits to go into each side of the headphones. It is not replaceable, so if it breaks, you need new cans. Koss honors limited lifetime warranty, if you register.Sound:They sound as good as my AKG Q460, maybe with a touch more bottom end and a bit more of treble. Due to their construction, they do not isolate outside noise as well, so using listening to your tunes on the train or in the city with lots of ambient noise will make you crank the volume up. Beware, their bass is powerful, so treat your ear drums with some care.Listening to PortPro's at home or during a stroll in a park or quiet neighborhood is a joy.Treble, mids and bass are in a great balance, so these cans do not require much tinkering with EQ. I actually use the ""Flat"" equalizer setting on my iPod.Impedance is 60 Ohm, so you need to turn up the volume a notch or two when switching from a pair of standard 32 Ohm headphones to make PortaPro's sound at the same level of loudness.I bought them at K-Mart which was closing and they had them marked for $32.I will eventually buy the 6-pack of replacement foam ear pads.Included is a nice little faux leather pouch and can fold and fit into it very nicely, so good news for road warriors.",5
"I've tried out a number of portable headphones and these are the best I've found so far.  This is the second pair I've purchased since I liked the first set so well, and wanted another for my laptop bag.PROS:Good sound quality, lightweight, comfortable, fold up easily into a carry bag so it's portable.  The folded set fits very nicely into limited laptop storage compartments.CONS:Kinda flimsy feel, although I've had the first pair for over a year with no problems.  They also look a bit dorky but, eh, whatever.Overall I think this is a nice choice for the price.UPDATE:  I had the wire to the right phone short out after just over 1 year.  This pair doesn't get folded that often (and these are foldable, travel type phones), so I don't think that reflects well on the unit.  I've downgraded to 3 stars based on this issue.",3
"Decent, clean sound.  The offset design has advantages and disadvantages.  They fold up all right, but seem to spring back to a pre-set width so you can adjust and leave them in one position.  Not disappointed and the price is pretty good.",3
"With all of the hype related to these headphones, I was expecting to be let down in some way at the very least.  However, after many months of use at the office, I've come to believe that these headphones are really something special.  It's hard to imagine getting such a full sound out of such an inexpensive/lightweight product.  They are easily driven by an ipod or smartphone, but they really shine when plugged into my laptops(with beats audio and without).  Solid, but tight bass, rich mids, and shiny highs help these headphones breathe new life into the songs that you've been listening to for years.  Do yourself a favor and stop thinking about it and just get yourself a pair.  You won't regret it.",5
"I had a pair of these (Best Buy edition with cloth-covered cable & updated styling, not anniversary) years ago. Those were misplaced, but I remembered them fondly. I switched to Bluetooth behind-the-neck models for awhile (Motorola over-ear) and those were great, but I forgot how much sound-quality was sacrificed by the switch. Had to buy new ones after my Motorolas were stolen, so I came back to the cord, a little reluctantly since I use them actively.Glad I went back. The clarity is fantastic. Comfort-wise, I do have to toggle the firmness down to light every time I put them on (and that's somewhat annoying) but the convenience of rolling them up eclipses that. The cord is on the shorter end at four feet, which I appreciate- I've never seen the need for long cords on headphones. If I need to use them at a desktop or something I'll grab an extender. The pouch is gimmicky and a touch small, but serves the purpose- I'll probably put them in something else. The headband can catch longer hair, but I wear a buzz, so that's not a problem. They're even more comfortable than similar models while laying down to sleep. Some people complain about the style, but I've always loved it. They're easier to wear underneath a knit hat, or in conjunction with sunglasses. The design is eternal for a reason.You really can't do better at sub-$100. If your hair is longer, wrap electrical tape around the band- it won't collapse anymore, but you won't rip your hair out. If the stock pads don't satisfy, get some Grado bowl replacements (but the stock pads are fine.) If they break, send them into Koss for a replacement, $6 S&H.; The new model has an angled plug- not right-angle, but not straight either, which I find convenient for preventing cable-breakage but might not work with some cases.A testament to how good these headphones are- my very picky grandfather has gone through several different models of headphones. After he tried my new set on once, I had to order another pair the next day.",5
"Hands down the best sounding headphones I have ever purchased.They really should be broken in for optimum sound though; hook them up to an audio source and let it play through them for about 24 hours.  After breaking in they will sound amazing.I've read quite a few reviews about how some $10 pair of headphones sounds just as good/better and I can tell you that it's crap.  Some people can't tell the difference between bass and quality.  If all you want it bass with no fidelity you'll be sadly mistaken but if you want bright, clear sound with a good range and great clarity, these are awesome for the money.",5
"Looking for portable headphones, I first went with theSennheiser  PX 100 Lightweight Collapsible Headphones, because I've been using Sennheisers for years (the HD 580s for about 12 years before they finally died, and theSennheiser  CX300-B In-Ear  Stereo Headphone (Old Version)for the couple of years they lasted), and figured I'd try their portable headphones.  As I wrote in my review of the PX-100s (http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I6FUMDQJ2RW/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm), I found them uncomfortable, and lacking in bass.  These PortaPros fix both those problems: I can wear them for many hours consecutively before my ear cartilage gets a bit sore, but this is a big improvement over the Sennheiser PX 100s, which started hurting after only about an hour.  Bass is good enough, though perhaps lacking slightly compared to high-end headphones.  But, for $40 these offer a great bang-for-buck in sound quality.The only negatives are the retro look (if that bothers you - I don't mind it at all), and if you have long hair (I don't), the metal band tends to catch your hair and pull out a few strands; I know when this starts happening to me, it's time for a haircut :)",5
"Pros: Compact, light weight, lifetime warranty, great sound for size/price.  Moving around much?  They have a tight grip on your head.  Durable, I once stepped on them causing one of the ear pieces to pop off and I simply clicked it back into place like nothing happened.  Short cord for people who don't wander 20 feet away from their audio player (laptop, mp3 player) like some other headphones have.Cons:  I've heard people say how comfy they are, but my hat size of 7 1/2 says very different.  After a few hours they simply prove to tight and give me a headache.  And that's whether I have sound running through them or not.  On occasion a hair might get caught in the metal band but not enough of a problem to warrant not getting them.I use these for my laptop and iPod and they do an excellent job with music and gaming.  Base is kinda bad but for the size and cost it does more then enough.  Mine have the straight plug which is really annoying as I like the 90 deg ones much better but it works regardless.  I'd recommend these to other people. The only drawback I can find is they can give me a headache of using them for a couple hours.  Maybe if you have a smaller head you'll be ok?  They can seem flimsy, but I've had them for 2 years and have traveled with them so I couldn't justify and claims of them being ""cheap"" headphones.  And with a lifetime warranty I say go to town.  I don't use the case at all either, used to, but I deemed it to much of a hassle and lost it somewhere.  No regrets on that.I would give the product 5 stars but the headache thing really detracts from them.  I still like and use my pair and if you want some cheap good headphones I'd go with these again any day of the week.  (Maybe not Tuesday)",4
this is a decent headphone it works without issue and the wires seem to be thick enough not to bend and break leaving only 1 side working. however since i wear glasses they seem to be a little tight for extended use however if you can remove them for awhile every couple of hours then i would definetly recomend these especially at less than $50,4
we have two pair for now over a year and they are well made and easy to store away in a purse-,5
"I've had the Koss PortaPro's for about four months now and I decided it was time to give them the review they deserved.I mainly used standard Sony studio monitor headphones for personal music listening when I'm on my desktop computer or laptop, and I would use earbuds with my iPod on the go or in bed at night. I decided I wanted to try these headphones considering the golden reviews they've been getting.When I received them they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be, but they fit my head perfectly and they are very comfortable. I can't even feel them after a while. They do require a little adjusting after some time but my ears don't feel sore after long listening sessions.They sound great and they look great, too. Some people might think they look too wild/retro/geeky, but that's what I like about them -- they are unique in their design. They don't look bad to me at all.They have an extremely clean and crystal clear sound. The highs are crisp, the mids are warm, full, and natural, and the lows are tight, deep, and full-sounding. They do have a little bit of extra bass, but that's no problem for me. I can just turn off the EQ on my computer audio player and they sound perfect. I always have the EQ off on my iPod so they sound just fine there, too. The extra bass really isn't that bad at all. It shouldn't affect your buying choice with these headphones.Yes, they are flimsy and you have to be somewhat gentle with them, but they are surprisingly durable. I've fallen asleep at night with these headphones on and when I wake up finding them near my pillow off my head, I'm worried they had been destroyed. To my surprise, I find no bends or any signs of stress on them. The ear pieces don't even fall off either, and those are held on with just a little plastic clip it looks like. (They pivot to fit the shape and position of your ears.)The only cons I have about these headphones is the somewhat short cable length. It's 4ft. long, but I sometimes find myself accidently yanking on them with my arms when I'm not careful. That's fine though, as I just use another 4ft. extension cable I found. I also have to adjust the headband to almost it's widest when I put them on. I wish there was some type of locking mechanism on the headband.These have become my standard headphones for at-home and on-the-go listening. Overall, these are great headphones and I will definitely choose these for the rest of my life, or until they stop making them.",5
"This Koss Model received overall very good reviews.  I can understand why, they sound full, open  and music sounds great.  Also comfortable, although I have not worn them for an extended time.  I would recommend  if one uses them hooked up to a cell phone make sure the mike is relatively close to your mouth.  Others may have a difficult time hearing you.  Very please!",5
"Why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic ear-cups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews?  Because they sound amazing.  Nothing in this price range even comes close.  Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II.  Well, I have both and they are both excellent headphones, and the sennheisers are much better quality, but the sound of the Portapros is much better.  I am on my second pair, and will buy another when this set breaks.",4
"These phones sound great for the price. I have owned 3 of them and the plug will short out in 6 months or less if you use them often. I have purchased 3 because I see them as disposable toy junk. I have not found a better sounding phone for 25 dollars so I see it as 50 dollar per year deal. I have Grado 60s and  Sennheiser's  HD 280 pros, for 10 years with no problems, but they are bulky and heavy for travel and exercise.I have owned Sennheiser's 100s and 200s and they sound as good but no better, and they cost 2 times more and the last 6 months or less as well or snap like a rotten twig.I may buy the Koss pros again and tape the plug area to reduce the stress, but I know that 6 months or so they will end up in the trash. Buy them, but no one I know has had a pair last longer than a year with light use. If they are lost or stolen you will not feel bad as the person who steals of finds them will get the honor to throw them away. It's a shame, but Koss has destroyed their once good name because their quality has been lost and I wonder how they can compete with other companies who make phone with fashion and style and the durability to stand the stress from younger folks who wear phones for hours everyday. I guess a week tops and they will short out.",2
I have this for 3 years now and I still use it for my everyday use. It is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones. Too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymore.,5
"I purchased these headphones to replace my Sennheisers PX100.  For several months I was happy.  The sound quality is right up there with the PX100.  However, I use headphones pretty much everyday for running, exercising, walking, etc.  I need them to last and take a beating.  I am constantly pulling on the cord by accident or even dropping my mp3 player detaching it from the plug.  Now after maybe 6 months of use I have lost sound in the right ear.  It sometimes drops in and out but this is mainly due to the cable being loose inside the earpiece.  It is pretty much unrepairable.  The Sennheisers also cut out in this same manner but they lasted 2 years.  I guess one way you can look at it is that you can buy 3 of these for the price of 1 PX100.  I'm not sure if I will try to buy these again yet.  It seems that the part where the cable enters the headphone is the weak link in a lot of portable headphones. . . or maybe I am just too rough with them.",3
"Bought four sets of these phones for $25 apiece on the Amazon website.  This price is 1/2 of the MSRP!  I have owned Porta-Pros for nearly 30 years. Just recently, I had the chance to compare them with super high end 'phones costing $350 and $1350(!).  Both were over the ear models.  While these pricey 'phones delivered superb sound,  the difference from the Koss 'phones, in my opinion did not justify spending 12 to 40 times as much money!  More importantly,  the over the ear models proved extremely uncomfortable, in my case producing jaw pain after a relatively short period on my head, and so severe  that I had to reach for the bottle of Motrin.  By contrast, the Koss 'phones, with adjustable ear pressure, are supremely comfortable.  I can wear them for hours without any problems.  Finally, Koss stands by their lifetime guarantee- no questions asked, even if you mistakenly sit on them.  In summary,  you absolutely will love this headphone.  Even the Stereophile gurus acknowledge the incredible price/performance ratio of this stellar product.  Unconditionally recommended!",5
"I bought them through a relative's recommendation. They sound great with classical and vocals, but the isolation is nonexistant so they are not the best options if you want to listen on a bus.",3
"It's true, when I'm on the go, these are what I take with me.They leak sound, but what does it matter when you're smashin' a DJ set?Bestow these on your head, and you might look like something from Tron.So work it, because these have a very clear sound. The bass isn't amped, but you don't want it to be if you're producing music.For what it is, plus the lifetime warranty ($6 for shipping) - I've suggest these to many a person.P.S. - It's been over a year of heavy use, and even losing them once in a moshpit, only to later find them sweaty, but unharmed!These things can take a hit, and the bass is still better than I thought it would be.",5
"I had mine sent back and i think it was 14 dollars (like a year ago) + shipping.  And I felt like I got a brand new one back in the mail.  They even replaced the cushions.The sound quality of this headphone is very VERY good.  Lets just say that it has its own style.I can say for sure, that...  Highs are clear, and the base is on the heavy side, and it has just enough surround sound.  But the sound quality of these headphones are so unique that you just have to try them out for yourself.If you are an audiophile, you got to have one of these just because it's worth having it.",5
"I was a long time loyalist to the Sennheiser PX 100 headphones. I went through two pairs in a few years but was absolutely bummed when I heard that they were no longer producing them. Instead, they improved on the design but I didn't want to spend the extra money and the reviews weren't as promising as the original models.Instead, I looked around and settled on the PortaPros. The sound is awesome, the storage is very good (not as great as the PX100's), they are very durable, the cord length is perfect, and the 1980 throwback design is just a bonus. Once I wear down my current pair that I'm using right now, I will definitely have to buy another.",5
"The Koss PortaPro Headphones work for me as earbuds don't stay in place.  I use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality.  So far I haven't experienced any problems, I have had them over a month.",5
"I purchased these headphones for a recent overseas trip.  I used these headphones on the flight to and back from Europe and they proved to be excellent for both music as well as movies.  If you can live with the design, these headphones are hard to beat for a reasonable price.",5
"I was skeptical that these would provide such a good sound, but they really do sound as good or better than high end headphones.",5
"Porta pros have been around for decades in various models and there's a reason they've been so successful. It's because they sound so good!  I've had several versions of these since the late 70s, and never been disappointed. Get some, you'll be glad you did.",5
"This is an excellent product for the money.  First time I tried them on it was unbelieveable how well they sounded.  Even the low end is pretty good for such a lightweight headphone.Previously I had a set of Altec Lansing UHP304 Headphones which I paid well over $80.  They sounded very good, but after less than a year of use a short developed in the cable and one side kept cutting out.  I returned to Altec Lansing and never heard anything from them.  No more Altec Lansing.  These Koss headphones at less than half the price and equal sound quality, and with a lifetime limited warranty can not be beat.  Had them for over a year and still sound great.  The sensitivity is also excellent which means I do not have to turn up the volume as much as with some of the cheaper headphones.A quick note about Koss, I had a set of Pro 4AAA (I think) headphones that I bought in the early 1980's.  I started having problems with them.  I wrote a letter to Koss and sent it with the headphones to them and in a few weeks I had my headphones back repaired and working perfectly.  And this was around 2003.  Still have the headphones, even bought an upgrade version of them.Good company, good product.",5
"I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.",5
"I just got these in the mail today. I wanted something cheap with decent quality. The sound quality from these headphones is amazing. I can't attest to the durability of them since I just got them, but wow, the sound is crystal clear with great highs and lows and no distortion. They are kind of dorky looking though.",5
"It is absurd that these are so cheap. They sound basically as good as pro studio headphones. Totally effortless, full range of sound that is completely clear. And since they are open, you can still hear things around you, so you don't walk around with that sensory-deprived ""living in a cloud, disconnected from the world"" feeling.Also they're totally comfortable. Cannot go wrong with these.",5
"very good headphones, especially for the cost. The sound is not really accurate, its more muddled in the mids and lows. But for some reason, this just makes them sound awesome, like some vintage amp playing an old school record. I definitely recommend these.",5
"I can't improve on what's already been said about these phones.  Sound as good as my Grado SR60 at about half the size and cost.  Seem to be very well constructed but I've only had them a few days.Stayed in place on my head through a sweaty 6-mile jog this morning.  First time I've had my tunes along on a jog and I highly recommend it.I run on a busy highway so I wanted to be able to hear outside noises for safety.  I could hear the traffic and the music.  With no outside noise, the music is just incredible.  I use 320kbps mp3 mostly and, although I have a pretty good pc stereo setup (M-AUDIO, Kenwood, Bose), I heard not only new musical nuances but words which I had not previously recognized.I don't pretend to be an audiophile and my hearing has gone downhill but I've been into music a long time.  We're into SACD, DVD-Audio with Klipsch and Polk speakers so I think I've heard some pretty good music.  I was still impressed with the clarity and fidelity of these little phones.  Oh, I've tried them with both my pc stereo setup and through a Sansa Clip player.  Both sound terrific.They don't look as hip as the little buds but they don't look totally dork either.  Cable is plenty long enough for me.  Now, I did hear a slight click with each jogging step which I think is just the wire slapping the phones or movement of the ear cup itself.  It may begin to bother me and if so I'll try to eliminate it but today it just helped me maintain a steady pace and didn't detract from the music at all.I think most people will really like these phones.  I definitely do.",5
"I find them comfortable enough. They are also small and light. They do sound fine to me, but I am not a great judge of that anymore. However, there is one annoying thing, the short cord. I am sure that's all in the eyes of the beholder, but that's how I feel.",4
"I needed a set of headphones that was small enough to take with me wherever I go. These deliver surprisingly punchy trebels and mids. The bass could be stronger, but is not at all shabby for other headphones in this price range. Love the retro look. The foldability makes them ideal for my laptop bag and workout bag.",5
"I agree with all the positive reviews about these amazing stereophones. They sound phenomenal for the price. The only negative is the weakness of the cords. After a year or two of normal use, one side or the other may break its connection and there's no way you can fix it yourself (many tiny strands to solder). I have returned mine twice to Koss (great lifetime warranty) and they have replaced them for a small $6 shipping charge. It takes about 3-4 weeks. That's my only complaint.",4
"These headphones are not only great for listening to music. But I bought them for playing electric guitar, piano, and violin thru them for prartice. The extra ohm ""60"" makes the diff over the 32 ohm ones on the market. I didn't want the big bulky studio ones that feel like you are wearing football helmet after a hour. These are feather lite and really can't even tell they are on your head. You line 6 Pod users or other multi effect users, well lover these. the extra ohm does make a diff in tone. No ice picking or high shrill. Rich bass and tone through out. Very pleased with them. As well as the tone for MP3's. Very rich tone all the way around. At 60 ohm you won't notice that much of a diff for mp3's. But for playing musical instruments thru them, the extra ohm makes a BIG diff in tone.Well be using these with my Line 6 Pocketpod and guitar on the shady back porch all summer long. They are not like my Marshall Stack, but they excellent.I know my neighbors well love em..",5
These are great sounding headphones ! They are little hard sometimes to resize for your head but the sound is stellar for the price.,5
"28 years. 28 years and counting. This is how long since the Koss PortaPro was introduced, and to this day, they still roll off the production line virtually unchanged since 1984. Talk about market endurance and lasting appeal. This headphone model trudged through and survived the ever evolving portable music industry, from the cassette Walkman, to the era of MP3 players and the iPod and now, the streaming era. It's baffling to imagine how one seemingly unassuming product could accomplish such a feat.One probable cause is the quality to price ratio. The PortaPros have gone up in price over the years, but still, currently at $40, they still remain a great value in headphones because of their unrivaled sound quality at this price point. Koss, for the most part, is known more for their budget headphones but the PortaPro is one audiophile secret that the masses need to know about. These pump out sound so decent, they compare well enough against headphones way beyond  their price range! In fact, I like their sound signature so much that I use them as my starting reference headphones to analyze other sets. They are the ultimate beginner audiophile headphones.So what is it about these cans that make them so great? Why are they revered by fans all over, sparking a rather vocal cult following?Seeing them for the first time, you might not even dare venture to try them on. They look like light, flimsy, cheap 80's headsets. (Which is in a sense, what they really are.) Some may even argue vainly that they are so ugly and hideous, it will be horrifying to be caught dead with them hugging your noggin. ( I find them charmingly futuristic in a retro kind of way, though. Like how sci-fi movies in the 80's imagine what future thingies will look like.)  There's a minimalist no-frills commitment to these headphones' presentation. See, there's just this mere sliding metal headband on top attached to plastic mounts that support two thin, even more plastic, grilled sound drivers, thinly wired, with black foam padding, terminating into a 3.5 mm 45 degree jack. But that same plastic mount gives the PortaPros their unique iconic look and character. It's called the ComfortZone slider and together with the metal accents, it lends the PortaPros that RoboCop/Terminator aesthetic. It was probably a gimmick back in the day because the ComfortZone settings (Light to Firm) hardly do anything for me except point the drivers outward on the light setting, resting the foams on my temples. The PortaPros, therefore, are known and remembered for this look and Koss was smart not to tinker with something that is iconic. And you don't get the PortaPros for their ruggedness or luxurious build quality. They feel so utilitarian they could be the headphones communists will finally distribute to the proletariat. They feel so delicate and fragile that Koss was kind enough to give a lifetime warranty! So basically, if you buy a PortaPro now, you are set for life.At the end of the day, you get the PortaPros because of their sound characteristics. These would never have achieved their legendary status if not for their aural properties. This is why we obsess over headphones anyway. They are not a flash in the pan fad nor are they glossed over by celebrity marketing. These are honest and straight-forward consumer products endorsed by the same consumers themselves.What you get with the PortaPros is surprising clarity and detail, you can't believe a budget headphone is actually piping it out. The drivers on these things are awesome for their price and size but they are not perfect, of course.The high end detailing sparkles with this set although treble is somewhat grainy. Bass is substantial and not overpowering but, however, could get loose in the higher bass frequencies. This low end bleeds to the the lower mids rendering it with a slight nasality. The proper mid frequencies are forward and present but they lack smoothness. Technically, with these faults, you could argue that these shouldn't sound good, but all in all, when you combine these traits, it's actually a pleasurable listening experience.I think, coupled with their specific sound signature, what makes these portable sets shine is their soundstage and separation. Since they are technically open back sets, the soundstage is unconstrained by resonance, giving them this feathery, airy feel.  Instrument separation, as a consequence, is remarkably even and it fleshes detail out. Of course, there a lot of expensive high end sets that could do this better, but if you are upgrading from entry level sets near the PortaPro's price point then the sound difference will be life changing. Like I said, these could rival or outperform headphones twice or triple their price. Some people compare the PortaPros to another open back can, the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone or theGrado Prestige Series SR-60i Padded Headphones, but nothing could be more different. These Grados are excellent and extremely detailed but they skew more towards the bright treble side of things which could sometimes be too harsh for some people. The PortaPros are tuned more as balanced sets, if not bass focused, what with their slightly forward mids.  Both these Grados and the PortaPros are brilliant entry-level sets , although the SR80i are twice as expensive. I use the PortaPros, appropriately enough,  more for 80's synth pop, rock and new wave while I prefer the Grados for acoustic guitar recordings, and  if you must, do get both.So in summary, the iconic PortaPros are a 20th century wonder for their longevity and enduring appeal. Their price to sound quality and their minimalist utilitarianism is probably the main reason why they have such a following. If you dig that retro chic look and you want a quick entry to quality sound without breaking the bank, then get yourself the PortaPros now!",5
"Ok, I went on a headphone buying spree, so I'm comparing these PortaPros to headphones that cost many times as much (Sennheiser HD595), headphones that cost a bit more (Sennheiser PX100) and my old Sony headphones. Well, my Sonys are history. I never realized how smeary they were--no detail.These Koss PortaPros hold up very well in comparison with any of the phones I mentioned. Good detail and the frequency balance is excellent, far preferable to the PX100s and even comparable to the expensive phones. Very pleasant to listen to. If I had never heard those expensive phones, I would be happy to have these Koss PortaPros as my only phones.What I've learned by comparative listening is what people refer to as ""soundstage"". With the Koss phones, everything sounds like it is at your ear or between your ears. Not unpleasant, and you won't know what you're missing until you hear it for yourself, but the expensive audiophile phones give you a sonic perspective that extends beyond your ears--far more realistic. I know that considering the price differential this may be an unfair comparison, but I just had to point out that you do sometimes get what you paid for.So the bottom line is, I am in love with the sound of my expensive HD595 headphones and at the same time I am very happy to have these Koss PortaPros for portable use. As a bonus, the PortaPros are even more comfortable than the expensive phones. And, unlike some folks, I wouldn't say they are ugly at all--just different.",5
"Everything the the other reviewers said seems to be true.  Much, much better sound and more comfortable than the &#34;standard ear-buds&#34;.  I flew 10 hours back to the US from Germany, after watching 4 movies, they are immensely comfortable.  They do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them.  Very nice sound for an under $30 set of headphones.  The lifetime warranty was the final clincher for me.",4
"The Koss PortaPro has a great &#34;retro&#34; design because they haven't changed the darn things since they were introduced in the 80s. The reason being that they got it right the first time. The sound quality is great for open design headphones, they're easily adjustable (both the headband and the firmness with which the ears &#34;grab&#34; the head), very light, and can be worn for hours at a time without having any issues.They fold down into a relatively convenient size and even come with a travel bag. If mine get damaged, I will buy another pair.",5
after reading most customer reviews and a few technical reviews on portable headphones the two names with the most positive comments were koss portapro and sennheiser px100 i bought both pairs to do my own comparisons after 1 week i submitted a review giving the portapros a definite edge although not a dramatic one after a full month of listening i no longer use the px100's i hear things on the portapros you don't even notice on the 100's i would like to amend my original opinion to say the portapros are significantly better and provide a lifetime warranty,5
"These headphones work great. I use them with my Ipod touch and my laptop. They are light, extremely comfortable and have excellant sound. Tough to beat for the cost, and the Koss warrenty is the best. Highly recommend.",4
"I've had these headphones for close to ten years and primarily use them when I travel.Pros-----GREAT Sound-Lifetime Warranty-Once you have them on your head and adjusted they stay thereCons-----No volume control-They press so firmly on the side of my head it gets uncomfortable after a while, even using the pressure setting switch on light-I've had them in twice for repair - lost sound on one side (for no apparent reason - I'm not hard on them and don't use them that often, only a few times a year)-Every time I take them off they lose their adjustment settings-They really need to come with a better case.  Mine came with a drawstring pouch that was difficult to insert the phones into (I lost it when I sent them back for repair the first time).  Koss has some hard cases but one of the comments was that the case was way too big - not conducive to travel.Overall Grade - A for sound, B for comfort, C for sturdiness, the missing volume control and case, and the minor annoyances.Overall I'm pleased with these (would not have kept them for ten years otherwise) but perfect they ain't.",4
"5.5 starsFor my 200th review, I thought I'd sing the praises of one of the most useful and wonderful things I've ever owned, the PortaPro. I got these shortly after they came out, as I always longed for bass in my early Aiwa walkman (best of breed back then). These thangs changed my life!I still love music deeply, but back in school it was everything to me, my solace and balm and ecstatic release, hours and hours every day. I still wear mine daily while running the dog, walking the dog, and during various non-dog activities as well. They have tremendously balanced sound, lots of bass but very open and tight bass, not sloppy. The highs are clean and never harsh, the mids smooth and present. From Bach to the Beatles to Metallica to Charlie Parker, they deliver musical sound in a pleasingly full sound spectrum, top to bottom.For the money they are a miracle! They turn any mp3 player into a real sound machine, and BLOW AWAY any of the in-ear phones except for the thousand dollar customs (go to the HeadRoom online if you want perfect sound...they sell these alongside the best cans in the world, say no more). They deliver a surprisingly real soundstage and plenty of truly musical detail.Add to that two great features. They fold up easily and fit in your pocket (make sure to get the folding ones, worth the extra few bucks for sure), making them a perfect companion to tiny mp3 players (they are a perfect match with my Muvo 2gb player, such sound from such tiny devices!).But THE best feature of the PortaPros is the inestimable LIFETIME guarantee!! And they ain't whistlin' Dixie, folks, they mean it. I would know, as I've bought maybe four of these in the last 20 years, but I've owned about 14 new pairs total! Whenever the cords wear out or pull out of the ear (can happen, it's only thin rubber and wire, happens now and then when you're mountain climbing etc), I send them back to Koss with a six-dollar check (only gone up one buck in 20 years) and in a week I get a BRAND NEW pair. If that ain't taking care of the customer, what is?So, for coming through on their promises, and for making a truly great-sounding and very cheap-for-the-quality headphone, I give Koss total props and praise for this product, one of the best values I've ever encountered as a music uberlover. This and a Muvo 2gb player will set you back only a hundred bucks and then give you so much musical pleasure everywhere you go. I have enjoyed my PortaPros on mountain tops, inside the Louvre, Prado, MOMA, etc, by the sea, on ski slopes, on trains in the high alps with views to die for as Beethoven's Sixth took me to heaven, in the subways and busses of dozens of lands, in front of literally thousands of sunsets from Big Sur hills to Jamaican beaches to Mallorcan cliffs to Norwegian fjords and so on for twenty-plus years.I can only imagine how gratifying it must be for the spirits of the great composers to know that their music can now be heard in good sound anyplace on the planet. If we've achieved one useful thing as a species in the last thirty years, this is it: great portable sound that turns any post office line, etc from a nightmare into a dream.In fact, now that I think of it, no product I've ever purchased has brought me this many hours of joy, except perhaps some of my guitars. The Pros were 25 bucks in the mid-80s and are now only 35; with inflation it should be far more. Thank you Koss for proving that some companies still know what value is. This is a bargain of the highest degree. Whoever invented these, I LOVE you!Buy some for a friend; I have, many many times. And make sure to buy some for yourself; your life will become a lot sweeter, especially if you know how to let music take you far beyond this mortal coil.My highest recommendation.",5
"read a few of the below reviews and you will get the picture: these are the best portable headphones for iPod use, hands down.  They sound incredible, and are best for working out/walking with an iPod.  NOTHING compares. Not the ipod ear buds, not $300 isolation headphones that go in your ear (i wasted big time and money on them)...nothing.  If you only buy two headphones in your lifetime, but these for your ipod and a pair of Grado SR60's/80's for home ipod/stereo use.  YOu will be happy you did.",5
"These things have been around forever because they sound great. Sure, they look funny but if you're just chillin' at home, do it!",4
"I am not an audiophile by any means, but the PortaPro headphones are exceptional.  The sound is, especially in lieu of the minimal cost of the unit, clear with a more than adequate amount of bass.  As a bonus, the comfort level when wearing these headphones is wonderful.  Bottom line...a funky looking set of headphones that deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience.  Try them...you'll like them!!",5
"I bought these along with a similarly priced set of Sennheiser headphones about 9 months ago.  Not until I recently purchased a Zen Micro did I decide to test all my headphones on this MP3 player.  Needless to say, other than the Bose QC2 set, which is essentially in a league of its own, the Koss beat out every other set I own.  This includes both Denon and Sony closed systems.I guess the style and seemingly awkward design made me initially think these headphones were a bad purchase.  So, they were relegated to the bookshelf until the Zen player arrived.  I have to say that the goofy looking design is just that.  However, the sound quality (clarity, separation, tonal balance, etc.) is exceptional for an open ear system.  Nearly every bit as good as the Bose except that the ambient noise distracts from the experience at times.",4
"if you're considering buying this headphone, don't hesitate. it's worth your money. i use it for my ipod and my computer. i never thought headphone this price will sound this good. my only dislike is the looks.",4
"I've had these for a few months now and I'm very satisfied. Great sound quality, very comfortable, and very durable compared to the plethora of plastic dominating the market. So 5 stars from me!",5
"I really like these headphones, but as others point out, they are not very durable. My first pair broke after a year -- and I am very careful with my equipment. I only use them at my computer, they don't travel or get abused. They fell off my desk and the right channel is now shot. Anyway, the sound was great -- very warm with fantastic bass and accurate highs. They sound nearly as good as my entry-level Grados, but are much more comfortable to wear for extended periods. But buy two pairs now, or plan on replacing them later.-edit-Several years later, I am back to say that the two additional pairs I bought are both going strong and they are still the best quality/comfort/price combination in the world. I have more accurate in-ear phones that cost $200+, but for comfort and long listening sessions, these can't be beat. I hope they are never discontinued. The design looks dated and a bit dorky on your head, but once you hear them, you won't care.",4
I listened to several non-earbud headphones from $10-$100 and these are the best between them. While I haven't listened to headphones over $100 I believe it would sound better than many of those too (possibly the best ever). Good clarity with good bass.Very good construction too. Can adjust to a lighter setting for more comfort.Only 1 minor issue. If the earpads aren't centered on your ear or if you have big ears then sometimes the edges of the pad can press uncomfortably on your ear (only felt if you leave them on a while). Probably KOSS should offer a larger size (keeping the speaker the same though) or make the original pads at the edges (outer radius) slightly concave away from the ear.,5
"The portapro has very good sound and base,but the temple pads and metal hooks hurt my big ears,so I sent them back to amizon-Expo. The seenheiser px-100s also sound very good,but not quite as good as the portapros.I do like the px-100s because they are very comfortable.easy to use and are very well made and fold up better than the potapros,but Im still looking for a better headphone.",4
"Best bucks I've ever spend on a portable headphone... Glad I didn't go with Bose AE2... this sounds just as good, just as comfortable, and 1/5th of the cost... Heck, best money I've ever spend on a headphone.Also love the open-ear design, I can finally hear people talking with me at work now :)",5
"I picked this because of the high ratings these headphones have been getting high ratings for years.  The quality of sound reproduction, they do deserve a high rating.  If you aren't using them a noisy environment--they have no real passive or active noise blocking.  You can't be dissatisfied with the quality of sound reproduction.I was surprised by the light build and somewhat small size of them.  They certainly don't make a satisfying thud when you toss them onto a coffee table -- which probably isn't that good of idea anyway.  So, this lightness and somewhat small size I can just as easily viewed as a plus as well a minus.I really expected headphones which has been manufactured for decades to come with an RCA phono-plug rather than a modern one.  While I find it probably handier to have a modern type plug on the headphones, I really think they should have included a phono-plug  adapter with it.I'm not going against the years' of reviews before mine.  The sound from these headphone are clear, crisp, and has a fine frequency range.  I seriously doubt you're going to find anything  better than these headphones when they're on sale. The quality of sound reproduction was what I expected, I was just startled by the small size and heft of them.  You might find that a very pleasant surprise.",4
Cnet had these as the be-all and end-all but I found them to be average on my beats audio type touchscreen computer.,4
"I was on the verge of buying Bose headphones but the price bothered me. I read at least 50 reviews from different sources and decided to buy Koss plus my picky sister said they were good. I'm pleased, they sound great and the price is right.",5
"I bought these headphones based on the good reviews about the sound quality and the comfort, but I find them to be very uncomfortable. The collapsible band has two plastic pieces which press into the top of my head. There is no way to keep them away from my head without having the headset so loose that it falls off. Maybe I just have a small head or not enough hair but I like my Sennheiser PX100s better. They have a padded band which is very comfortable and I never feel the headset pressing on the top of my head and the sound quality is just as good.",3
"Works Great if you're not planning on getting sweaty, Sounds fine for the money compared to the price of the XtremeMac  class of Ear/Headsets on the market.",5
"I don't know how someone could give these anything below three stars. Sure, I could understand four, but two stars? These things are amazing! The only two cons I would have are that 1) they could be more portable: the ""earpieces"" don't rotate, so when you compress everything down to its most portable size, it's still more of a sphere than a circle. 2) Yes, I know that open-backed speakers are known for better sound, but I've had people sitting next to me be able to identify the song I'm listening to because these things ""leak out"" so much sound. The main problem with this (other than embarrassing yourself or annoying the person next to you) is that they don't work very well for plane riding or anything where it's loud (It was extremely difficult to hear many of the low notes in songs while on the plane last week). Other than those two things, these things are great. Speaking of folding flat earpieces, one of my buddies used to have those similar sennheisers, (I probably spelled that wrong) and he used to lend them to me for a long time until I got these, but the spot where the wire went into the earpiece actually frayed to the point that that earpiece went dead! So overall, I recommend these to anyone who just wants a cheap, yet VERY high quality pair of cans (but check out the Grado sr80i/60i, they may be a little bit less portable, but they're that much more amazing!).",5
So it folds up.  That's nice.  It sounds pretty good.  That's also nice.  But it also feels pretty cheaply built and the connector is not at a right angle so I'm expecting that the wire will begin to break near there from all the bending.,3
"I own two pairs of these headphones and gave my son a 3rd pair for Christmas. Great sound, lightweight enough to go jogging with or wear around the house while doing chores. Unlike earbuds, they stay in place. They are not indestructible- if you accidentally step on them, you will break them. But they do hold up just fine with normal wear and tear.Highly recommended.",5
"Finally found them on sale for $25. The sound is great. There is an emphasis on base but that's OK, I'm using this set with my FLAC player when I want music to wake me up and get me excited. I'm very happy with the purchase. If however you're looking for the perfect balance of sound and frequencies spend more money! For the average listener who just wants to get pumped, this is the set to buy. Besides, If you're listening to an iPod or any MP3 why would you want to spend more on a headset? There is only so much improvement that can be made considering the supression of the sound coming out of the device.",5
"I've had a history with Koss, and they provide such amazing sound quality!Two tips:1. Take care of them or they will get destroyed.2. Try to keep them in your room (or they will get destroyed).",5
"I had a friend order this for me a while back from a site and I must say they're still working great. Excellent, audiophile-quality headphones for a decent price. So far, they've held up incredibly well over the year or so I've had them. They're very light and they haven't fallen apart or cracked anywhere at all, but still glad to have the KOSS warranty to replace them if I need to. The carrying case is a bit small so do watch out for that, but they will fit with a bit of finagling. I am a 19 year old college student, so I'm on the go a lot. I keep them in my laptop bag and they fit right in. If I decide I want to be a tool and wear them around my neck, they're nice because they automatically adjust to their smallest headband size, so they fit around the neck more like a choker necklace. I also love getting looks from people. Some comments include:""I like your headphones.""""Those are some wacky ass headphones man.""""Those are nice how much did they cost.""""They sound amazing.""et cetera.Pros:-I personally love the 80's styling.-Fold really small and are very portable. (Duh)-Come with a carrying case that feels very high quality and protects them from me.-The ear cushions themselves do not feel like the cheap foam that I was expecting, they're actually closer to Tempurpedic mattress foam, but a bit less squishy.-They (used to) automatically adjust to your head size without even having to touch them. I'll explain below.-Of course, the best thing, they sound great.Cons:-They fold small, but not flat. The headphones are still as thick, when folded, as the diameter of the ear pieces and such. I really wish they folded flat, that would make these truly great.-They don't FEEL all that well made. (But have held up thus far)-Over the course of the year or so I've had them, the metal headband part has bent slightly, but I imagine it's from the times I've tried to fold them up too small, so be aware of that, I'll explain below.-They will make your ears ache after a while (an hour or so).Meh:-I don't like how small the carrying case is, if it wasn't so well made, I'd think I was going to rip the seams or something when putting my 'phones away. Actually, it's not the case itself that's too small, as I can fit my MP3 player in the bag as well, but the opening. It doesn't open very wide. Be careful not to snag anything when putting them away.-Price is pretty cheap, but not exceptional, but I can't complain.-They don't noise cancel, but they're not noise cancelling headphones. I put this here because it's both good and bad. I like hearing my music in peace, but I also like being able to talk to my friends without having to remove my left earpiece from my ear. So they're okay for that.-They have a comfort setting on the sides, it's a switch you have to work. No, it is not an electronic switch for ""bass boost"" or anything like that, so don't get all excited. It's a mechanical switch that basically pushes the pieces against your head tighter. If you have it on the light setting and you move/fold the 'phones inward though, it'll automatically jump to the firm setting I think. It's kinda gimmicky, but it does adjust the tension SLIGHTLY. This will not prevent them from hurting your ears after a long period.So, as you can see, my cons and such are mostly about certain ""bonus"" features of the headphones. As a pair of headphones, they're the best I've ever had.Okay, so as I wrote above, there are two things I have to elaborate on:-Self adjustment: When I first bought these headphones, I could hold one side with one hand and simply lower them onto my head, and they would self adjust like some piece of alien technology. Neat. Well, it's been a while and, while I do my best to take care of my technology, all the folding/unfolding of them, due to the nature of the design, has bent the headband slightly out of the almost-perfect circle it used to be in. It does NOT look any different aesthetically, but it inhibits the little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes from doing their job as well as they did originally. And by ""little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes,"" I mean ""those black things on the metal headband that guide it through."" Anyhow, not a huge deal, as it's still very easy to adjust.-Folding the headphones: As I've said above, the constant folding/unfolding of the headphones will (if you're not careful and you accidentally and repeatedly fold them up too tight without knowing) bend the metal headband to the point where it won't self-adjust as easily as it originally did. So, I'm going to help you figure out how to fold them, so you can avoid bending your pair on accident. Okay, so, it's pretty easy to do. The large plastic black pieces that hold the headphones fold inward. Fold them as if you were pushing them into your ears. They will swing into the center of the arc of the headphones about the little piece with the oval-shaped head cushions. Now, on each side of the hinge area, there is a loop and a hook. I don't remember which side is which, but you'll see it. It's the end of the metal headband. Hook the ends into the ends, and you'll have a nice neat circle. Now, you can move the little black slider pieces toward where you just hooked the headband to itself, but DO NOT GO TOO TIGHT. This is how you will bend them. I would say you can slide them about an inch and a half away from the hinge where the earpieces fold in. Now you should be good to go and they'll stay nice and folded.Anyhow, that's about all I have to say. These are well worth the money. I don't use them at home, because I have larger, more comfy headphones for that, but if I'm out? This is all I use. I generally hate earbuds, I always have, so this is how I listen to my music if I go out anywhere.",5
"These Are Big on BASS...I actually put some Grado G cushions over the stock on here and that made them more balanced sounding. I haven't tried the Kramer mod (See HeadFi)  But could be the way to go.Overall I would easily recommend these. If you have a bright sounding source, or great for movies.....",4
"The most amazing property of these headphones is that it's almost like you're wearing nothing.They're light and comfortable and the pressure of the ear pads is adjustable on both sides.These are probably the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn and I've owned many sets of headphones from Sony, Panasonic, Seinheiser, Ultrasone...The extra set of head pads above the ears reduces the pinching on the ears you get with most headphones.That said, the sound quality (here I'm using the word 'quality' literally, as in flavor, not how good the sound is) is punchy and bass-y, at the sacrifice of high end and midrange.I tested these headphones with a Sony Hi-MD lossless minidisc player with a FLAC audio source.These headphones are what I would call ""teenager headphones.""  They have sound properties that kids would look for.If you listen to a lot of music that has valuable high frequency sound properties you may wish to look elsewhere.  The high and midrange on these headphones is a little muddy.",4
"It has an amazing bass and great sound quality, adding a great price you get an amazing product (the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head).",5
"When I received the headphones I was pleasantly surprised. I had to find some that were cheap, as my Turtle Beach TBS-2052 Ear Force Z2 was damaged. I'm glad I listened to the good reviews I found.Surprisingly, the bass is deep, despite the size and type of headphones. If you like or not, that is a matter of personal taste. In my opinion, I had never bought a pair of headphones that were so cheap and also had such a good sound.One more thing: these headphones are not pretty, but its quality and durability are excellent.",5
"The first thing I will say is that when I got these headphones they were a lot smaller than I envisioned.  The retro look reminded me of some old headphones I had that were much larger.  I suppose that is my fault though since they are sold as portables.Pros:The sound quality is great for portables.  They sound even better than some of the lower-end, ear-covering studio headphones that I have.  I have always liked Koss' attention bass response in their headphones.  The cord is just the right length for portable headphones at about 3 feet.  Don't get these if you like longer cords.  They fold up very nicely and compact.  It comes with a carrying case and 1/8 to 1/4 adapter.  They are pretty light and comfortable, though a little tighter on wider heads.Cons:They feel somewhat cheap and I imagine the actual hinge piece on the speaker driver snapping off over time (the speakers are on a two way hinge for comfortable fit).  My head is on the larger side (while not huge) and I find these headphones the most comfortable on their largest setting.  They don't seem to cater well to larger heads.  I wish they had some kind of padding on the top of the headband.These are really good portable headphones with great sound quality, as long as your head isn't huge.",4
"This are pretty okay in about every way.  I suppose you might be disappointed, after waiting 30 years to buy them, but tough luck, pal.",3
They sound every bit as good as my ear-surrounding headphones.  I find them much more comfortable than the now popular ear-buds.  I think they are stylish -- Geek style.,5
"I'm in my 24th year as host of a radio show on NPR-San Francisco. These are the headphones I've been using for the past four years: Great sound quality and as important, very light and comfortable on the ear, so I can keep them on for the entire show and never feel at all uncomfortable. If you want to look like a pro, these aren't for you. They look like what a teeny-bopper would wear. But if you want an amazing combination of sound quality, comfort, and low cost, these are great.",5
"They are clear, crisp, and have just the right amount of bass.  You can't ask for any better sound from this style of headphone.  I have actually made a couple friends very angry when I told them to try my headphones, then ask what they cost, and then complain that they sound better than their $300 Sennheisers........",5
"If you have a 50 dollar budget for headphones. Stop looking. Add to cart and buy.I'd heard a lot about these throughout my internet travels, and finally had to give in and try them out. I'm so glad I did. The sound exceeds my more expensive, mid-level Klipsch Image One, and I kind of like the way they look too.I'm serious, though. Don't let the looks fool you, the PortaPros are performers! If these are anywhere near your budget, just get them.Note: They're not noise-isolating by any stretch, but the fidelity more than makes up for this.",5
"I listened with portapro in J&R; 9 years ago, and I was pretty surprised for the sound, and bought itsince then, I fell in love with portapro family series (PortaPro, SportaPro, KTX Pro)they all sound excellent, full bass with its power, clean human voice and crisp treble, and they're all well-balancedthey're pretty good headphones for portable (portable CD/MD players, mp3 players, pdas, laptops, even radios)I often suggest other customers to buy portapro, and let them hear themselves, and they're happy with the soundthe only weakness is: the cable, it breaks easilyfor KTX Pro users, you can order PortaPro earpads to get same great sound as PortaPro",5
"audio quality is great for the price bracket, but they feel flimsy. However, I haven't goofed up and done anything bad to them yet. I just wish that the build quality was a little better so I wouldn't be paranoid every time I used them.",3
"Highly recommended on their own, and especially if you're wanting to spend less than $60 on open-air headphones (in fact, these are a LOT less than $60, almost half that).I ordered my Koss PortaPros from Amazon after having to admit the Sennheiser HD 202 phones I ordered in August 2010 were not comfortable and had muddy bass.  I wanted some good headphones to use in the late evenings when my kids are in bed, and I really wanted to LOVE the HD202s.  The reviews were great, the price was great, and they are ""Sennheisers"".  All to naught.  I should have listened to my gut and heeded the few reviews that commented on the boomy bass.I had a pair of the original Koss PortaPros back in the mid 1980s and remember them very fondly.  These current PortaPros are simply great headphones.  They are clear, free from distortion, the bass is all there and punchy, not boomy or muddy in the least.The best thing I can say about headphones is that they don't just ""sound good for headphones"", they produce a very good sound.  And these Koss have great sound - really, very excellent.To be objective - I don't think I'd be quick to let a child use these.  While the build quality feels good, these aren't made for rough handling.If you want some incredibly rugged excellent-sounding budget headphones to have around for kids to use on computers, mp3 players, portable DVD players, etc, you can't go wrong with the Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones.  I buy these 2-3 pair at a time and always have a pair or two still in the packaging ready to bring out as needed.",5
"I have been looking for a set of headphones that I could use with my iPod Touch. I have tried MANY earbud type sets as they are the best for portabilty. I could not find a pair that could give me a wide spectrum of sound at a decent price. I do have a pair of Ultimate Ears MetroFi 150v that came pretty close to what I was looking for (they were a steal at $16.00 shipped from Dell). However, I needed a pair of headphones that were comfortable for extended periods and most of all sounded great. Well, after reading the reviews here I figured I would give these a try. I was shocked when I cranked up my iPod Touch with some Metallica and could hear ALL of the music without distortion. The Koss Porta-pros are very ""airy"" and do not cut off the world around you yet they produce a very clear and natural sound that is hard to find in any other headset under $75+. I am very picky about sound since I used to do sound engineering for a 8 piece band and got used to hearing a live, wide range of sound with detail that is very percise. The bass response with the Porta-Pros is natural and clean, the mids are natural and full and the treble is also clear and true. I am very pleased with these headphones and honestly the lifetime warranty sealed the deal. I remember when I was a kid in the early 70s. My father bought me a Koss headphone set (I cannot remember the model), but listening to the current top 40 music of the day from my simple record player, I remember how good those headphones sounded back then and how it would transport me into another world. Looks like I just got back to my musical listening roots.",5
"Great highs, mids and lows, for a $35.00 headphone you cannot go wrong... period. I have the Sennheiser px100 and may like these even more. More life and dynamics.",5
"I had a pair of Portapros for years and years.  When they finally wore out, I didn't feel bad replacing them.  I bought a second pair on Amazon last year (2012) and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use.  Reading the Sportapro review, the plug seems to be a weak link and I'm afraid that the Portapros have the same issue now.  It's really a bummer, they used to be GREAT.  Not sure what to replace them with.",2
"okay, so these shouldn't be in the ""noise cancelling"" section.  HOWEVER, they are the best-sounding portable headphones i've ever owned, period.  simply powerful, deep, clear, intense bass, clear highs, and fantastically accurate midrange.  and unlike many bass-heavy phones, they don't suck the lifeblood out of your poor little iPod.i've been through all sorts of earbuds and cans and found these after experiencing great sound on a previous set of Koss earbuds.  (i've never had any luck with the awkward fit of earbuds, but i can also highly recommend The Plug by Koss if you have no problem with them -- excellent bass and highs.)  anyway, after comparing and contrasting these PortaPros to the other 5 pair i've bought over the years, there is absolutely no contest when it comes to sound reproduction.  sure, they take up a bit more space than earbuds, but they do fold up quite nicely in the provided faux-leather sack.i use them every day for two hours on the subway and they've gone thru the ringer.  no cord problems, no sound problems. the foam rips over the pads after awhile, but with the lifetime warranty, no worries if you have any kind of problems.  $5 in shipping gets you a brand new pair, no questions asked.lastly, yes...okay, they look mighty dorky -- my coworker saw them and told me to get out of the eighties.  but really, it's all about the music, right?  those hipster dorks who shop at American Apparel wish they had this kind of style!",5
"I just bought these over the ear Koss Porta Pro classic phones today. I traded in my Ludacris Soul SL99's and some Sennheiser CX310's for cash and I purchased these. LOVE THE SOUND! Totally worth the deal it took to get these. Tight, but not overpowering bass, and crisp mids and highs. I hear all the details in the music, plus the energy exhibited in these phones is just phenomenal for the price. I bought these based on their being a top 5 value pick on CNET, which ranked the Klipsch S4's as the top value headphones. i own two pairs of those, and the Koss Porta Pros, and they couldn't be more accurate. Retro look yet classy. compact. tight fit. tight sound. great price. no complaints.",5
"Have used these headphones for the past 6 months mostly for travel, including on airplane, with an mp3 player and also at home with my computer.  They are the best headphones I've tried, particularly at this price level, for sound quality.  On an airplane, they perform better than the noise cancelling headphones I've used because they maintain the full spectrum of sound without the muffling sound I've encountered with noise cancelling headphones.  Because of the low distortion, I've been able to turn up the volume without hurting my ears to get past airplane noise.  Also, there is little sound leakage so when you do elevate the sound level, the passengers next to you won't be bothered as much by loud music.  The headphones also fold handily so they are small enough to carry for portable use.  At home, the headphones perform with excellence on higher quality playback devices so they are useful when you want to listen to music by yourself.  I highly recommend these headphones.  If asked about the negatives, I would say there are 3 things:  the headband is a bit small and a bit difficult to adjust with the clip on metal - the design of these are old and this could be improved; the cord is shorter than one would like; and finally the earpiece is covered by foam like the old airplane headphones, which deteriorate over time (but fortunately you can buy replacement foam cushions here on Amazon very inexpensively and they are easy to replace.  Look around on the net for reviews and you will find these are very positively reviewed.",5
"These Koss portapros are the last headphones you will ever need (with a few exceptions). The lifetime warranty is great if they every break and certainly adds to the value of the purchase. The headphones for their size are surprisingly portable and fit almost any head. The metal band can occasionally catch your hair which is why it didn't receive 5 stars for comfort. This style of headphone by design doesn't have very good noise cancellation, which is why you may want to pick up a pair of ear bud style headphones for loud environments, but the portapros still do a decent job with the task. Sound quality is superb for this price range there is none better than the portapros and they can hold their own against headphones with double the price. These are a must have for people who want to get the most out of their music and videos. Highly recommended!",5
I was looking for a small light over-the-ear head phones to use in my office at work. Still need to hear somethings going on around me. I didn't want an expensive set that I would have to lug home with me. Researched the ratings on Amazon and thought I would take a chance. Hadn't really considered Koss in many years. I have a few different Sennheisers that I love but again wanted a small less expensive set. Right out of the box I was wowed by the sound. I am sure they will improve once they are &#34;burned in&#34;. These are very light on my head and I have been wearing them for hours without any discomfort. There is a setting on the side for light for firm pressure (the small blue tab shown in the picture just below the band). Not sure I can tell much of the difference but I set them on light. These things fold-up very small and can be stored in a small leatherette bag (not a &#34;case&#34;) and then fit great inside my desk drawer. Again these had great sound and more bass than expected of something this size and cost. Just a little tweeking with my sound settings on my SIII and I was off and running.,5
"I own some high end cans and I.E.M.'s. These were bought as a walk around the house headphone. The big thing is: How does Koss generate such a rich sound out of an inexpensive headphone? I wish Koss was still in the market as a high end headphone producer, but if you need the best for what these cost, go no further!!! Be a little careful when taking them off because the earpods will snap together quickly due to the metal head band. They're light, comfy and can be somewhat adjusted for head pressure.I love em!!",5
"I've had my Koss PortaPro headphones for about three months.  I read good things about them in my online research and was particularly interested in the fact that they were said to have excellent bass for portable headphones.  In fact they do, as part of an overall rich, nicely balanced sound. I also find them to be comfortable and convenient (they fold up into a small circle and fit into a handy pouch.)  They appear to be well made and I anticipate using them for a long time.I also bought a pair of the cheaper Koss PRO1 phones in a two-fer Amazon deal when I bought these, and they're excellent sounding portable phones as well.  The metal construction of the PortaPros likely give them an advantage in durability; the sound quality between the two is comparable.  If you're interested in portable phones and want a better balance of highs, mids and more lows than you usually get with such phones (enough low end so that you won't need to use the annoying, sound-sucking bass boost found on most portable players), with good construction to boot, I highly recommend the PortaPros.  They'll definitely sound much better than the phones that come with most Walkman-style devices.",5
The headphones work quite well.  They don't feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound.  I use them on the treadmill as I don't like in ear headphones and they have held up well considering all of the sweat that has gone into them.,4
"After 15 years with my pair, I finally blew out the diaphragms.  Bought 2 pair of high-end Bose headphones. Was quite disappointed.Like others have said, these units have changed little since the mid 80's but have fanastic range, thump and boom.  Light weight comfortable and affordable.  Highly responsive coils and foldable design.Highly highly recommended as (in my opinion) being the best portable, non-noise cancelling phones on the market.Will make your mp3 player, walkman or discman much more robust sounding and gives very little ear fatigue,'cept after 4 or more hours of use.Getting another pair ASAP!",4
"I bought the Koss PortaPro Headphones to replace the earbuds for my MP3 player.  They're light, comfortable and have decent audio capabilities.  You can fold them up and put them in my pocket.  I'm generally satisfied with them and would make the purchase again.  My only gripe is that the earpieces tend to detach from the frame.  There's only a small notch and groove holding them together.  Reassembling them when the earpieces come off isn't a huge hassle, but it is annoying.",4
This must be the 10th pair of headphones I've purchased in the last 5 years.  But I've finally found the one.  I read the other reviews and went with this one based on the quality of sound.  And it's great!  I am amazed at how much bass these things produce!  They also fold up well and clip together.  It should be easier to find the cord around them but that's just a minor annoyance.,5
"i bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last; i'm on my third pair. when they work, they are ok, but every 6 months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back. i suggest throwing your money elsewhere.",2
"Just unboxed these today and started listening to them, and my first impression is that they're quite possibly the simplest and most functional I've ever used. No frills, no sexy designs, no gimmicks, no extra features, just GREAT sound and a fantastic, functional design that has withstood the test of time. I read the reviews that others gave and I thought ""they can't be THAT good,"" but for the price, I didn't have much to lose.Pros-Adjustable earpieces work surprisingly well; basically, it just gives you the ability to change how much pressure the headphones put on your ears. I find that my ears get sore with most headphones, but these are very comfortable.-The adjustable headband will fit any head size. I haven't got my hair caught in it yet.-They fold up for greater portability, and come with a very stylish leather bag (probably fake leather, not sure).-The sound is fantastic, better than anything in this price range. Clear mids and highs, and decent bass that doesn't sound distorted when I crank it.Cons-No manual/directions. They weren't that hard to figure out, but a simple sheet of paper with directions would have been nice. It took me a couple minutes to find out that you need to extend the headband, then clip together the earpieces, then retract the headband to make them small enough to fit in the bag.-I'm sure the foam earpiece covers will wear out, but luckily they sell cheap replacements.-The leather bag is quite small, and the headphones barely fit inside.Overall, great headphones. They do what they do, and nothing more. Perfect.**UPDATE, ONE YEAR LATER**: I accidentally pulled the cord out of my headphones. I shipped them to Koss and they sent me back a brand new pair for free (but I had to pay $9 for return shipping). No nonsense or forms to fill out, just a new pair of headphones in about a week. Koss, you've gained a lifelong customer.",5
"OMG! these are incredible!I never thought I would get sound this good from such a small pair of headphones!The bass is unbelievable! They have the puchiness and crisp sound I want! You can hear and feel drum beats as if you were right there with the band!The treble is also quite good, you can hear everything. the voices  are smooth and not high pitched, everything is balanced pretty well. But I feel the treble could be a touch higher.I don't know if the bass is intentionally enhanced, but it sounds a lot louder on these then any other headphones I have. But I like it, certainly makes my music sound more alive and in your face.Also worth noting, these have a nice soundstage, or stage presence if you will. Mostly because they don't cover around your ears.It would be great if Koss made a version of these in an over the ear Circumaural design. It would be nice to hear how it sounded.For a small portable headphone where sound isolation is not required, these are my babies.Here is what I own as of this review, to show you to what Im comparing from.Onkyo TX-SR500 recieverKoss UR29Koss the plugPanasonic RP-HJE50Koss Porta pro (of course)Audio-technica ATH-PRO5V",5
"We have a split family, and so it's great to have amazingly clear headphones that can fold up, that they love and move easily between homes without getting damaged. Great purchase!",5
I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  We are both more comfortable using the over the ear earphones rather than the ear buds that came with our Ipods.  He uses them for home and travel.,5
"Impressive set for the money, but obviously not professional quality. It does indeed catch hair and can hurt to pull off at times. If you want a good cheap headset, this is an impressive option for the price range it's in.",4
"Pros- Great Sound!!, Portable, Incredibly Comfortable, they just look coolCons- Not so durable, cord feels cheapI saw these on CNET as some of the best headphones along with ones that cost 100's of dollars and thought I'd give them a try.  I am not disappointed, they look great and sound even better.  They fold up to a small size too and can fit in your pocket.  They even come with a nice leather carrying pouch.",5
"I had a pair when I was in college back in the mid '70s and they were tops then.Great sound hi and low...not for deep mega bass as it will not carry the bass punch. All others...get your KOSS on and enjoy comfortable headphones that are lightweight and custom fit to your ears and head for rich, full sound.",5
"I have been having Grado Labs SR60 and SR80 for a couple of years, but Koss Portapro always rings into my mind as they are much cheaper, and they are supposed to be really good with a sound signature somewhat similar to my Grados.Okay, I finally pulled trigger two weeks ago. My initial impressions are (only burned in for about 10 hours).- Bass is a little too much (that's expected and is a selling point for Portapros). But with EQing, I can make it a bit better to my taste.- Sound is not too clear overall (comparing with Grados of course), but this may improve over time with more burned in (based on my prior experiences).My sources are very decent MP3 players and laptop with external sound card. No external amps were used in any way.In the end, Portapro lives within my expectations. I like them for their compact shape, portability (which Grado lacks), comfort (slightly worse than Grados). I think these are not as good as Grado Labs SR60 and SR80, if a straight comparison has to be made. Value wise, I would go to SR60 if you can buy used. If you only buy new electronics, then these are really good values.",3
I am very fussy about my music and the headphones that deliver that music must be good.  The sound from these headphones is  crisp and clean.  I sometimes feel like I am in the recording studio because I can hear every little nuance.  The bass is present but not overwhelming.  They are VERY comfortable to have on over long periods of time.  They cover the ear but don't keep you from hearing what's going on around you.  I don't like earbuds but didn't want huge headphones either.  These are just right in size.  They are adjustable both in length and in pressure against the ears.  They fold up for travel.  I have bought other headphones and keep coming back to these as my favorite.  I think the price is incredible for the quality.  I highly recommend them.,5
"I really can't add more than others have written.  Yes, I got my hair snagged the first couple times.  Once I figured how to take em on and off it's been no big deal.The sound quality is fantastic.  Bass is present in spades.  Highs are well defined and haven't gotten tinny on me.  I'm not a fan of too much mid range and these give me all the highs and lows I want.  Comfy too.  To the point I despise putting buds on when I workout.  May get a 2nd pair just for working out.  This is one product where the reviews on Amazon are dead on.Can't recommend these highly enough.",5
"I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price",5
"I wanted a pair of headphones that were lightweight, convenient to carry in my daily-use sling bag, and offered decent sound while being affordable. This set meets all of my criteria and I'm very pleased with them.",4
"These earphones have been around a long time for a reason. Although not as clear as Bose noise-canceling earphones, you cannot beat these earphones for the money. They work very well with an iPod. The bass is especially good, and the music itself is a lot more precise than with the normal iPod earbuds. These earphones are well worth the money.",5
"After spending some time creating various playlists on Spotify, I quickly realized that listening to all those wonderful selections through my laptop speaker just didn't do justice to any of the songs.  Being on a tight budget, I researched various budget-priced Bluetooth speakers and bought the JBL Flip.  The difference between the laptop speaker and the Flip was, needless to say, outstanding.  So I started listening to my playlists while working on the laptop and was quite happy to realize that I could turn up the volume quite high on the Flip without experiencing any distortion.  Unfortunately, my wife wasn't as enthralled as I was with my late night listening habit.  I tried listening to the songs with the volume turned down quite low, but lost the enjoyment of hearing all the details I could hear at a higher volume.  Still being on a tight budget, I researched budget-priced headphones and bought the Koss PortaPros.  I can't believe how much better the music sounds on the PortaPro compared to the Flip.  All the raves you read from other reviewers are true, but can you see my dilemma?  The Flip sounds better than the laptop, and the PortaPros sounds better than the Flip.  I'm now thinking that I will have to take out a home equity loan to move up to the next level.  For the time being, however, I'm extremely satisfied with the PortaPros and will continue to listen to my music at whatever volume I want without irritating my wife.",5
"Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case broke on me after a year or so of use.... The cable in particular. Cheaply made cables, go with V-Moda",2
"Over three years old now and still work like a champ....SOLID. CHEAP. SOUND GOOD.I have owned these about a year now.-Well Made-Good frequency response-comfortable-fair price for quality-allow external sounds to be heard (this is good for me, but maybe bad for others)-lifetime warranty with registrationI have a pair of Bose triport headphones, ultimate ears stuido3's, and Shure e2c.  I pick up the portapros every single time by preference.The in-ear type block out other noises if you want that, but for me this is one of the nice features of the portapro.  I can turn the music on medium and still hear if somebody is driving up behind me, trying to talk to me or trying to kicking down my door.  If I set the music low I liken it to having a conversation with somebody and the music is in the background.  As somebody that is very critical of everything I buy, I can say these exceeded my expectations.I thought I would like the in-ear type, but they are uncomfortable and if the seal in your ear canal is not perfect they have very poor frequency response.If you are looking for a nice pair of affordable headphones quit looking and buy portapros.  Once you get them go to Koss' website and register them for a lifetime warranty.  Bam... you are set with great phones for a long time.",5
"I bought the Koss Porta and the Panasonic-RP-DJS400because my Grado I80 poofed into disintegration. I'm poor so who cares. Anyway. Lets go. The Koss Portapros are great if you are using an I pod such device. The sound they give is very clear and crisp. I actually hooked them up to my Onyko 110 Rms surround sound system at 70 volume level and they did not blow they did crackle but these are not a stereo headphone but close.The Koss PortaPro is the best lightweight headphone for hearing all the great variety of pings and pongs with booms for the money. The displacement with these is incredible. The sound comes in so clear and uniform you almost think your in the studio but not quite. They are worth it.I bought the Pana...screw it look above.. ok.. These are great head phones the song displacement is no where near as good as the Koss. Koss has a lot higher range than the Panasonic. The Panasonic I think were designed to give a bigger bass with less treble in the high notes but they sound the best at the highest volume. I personally like that. You listen to music loud to get into it. So you have to listen to these cans loud to enjoy them. They are very good and better than AKG M80 MK11.. for the price(10 bucks cheaper that the Koss).So whos the best.The Koss Portapro got it down in the sound department and the construction is very good. Koss also stood up to my Stereo.The Panasonic sound muffled compared to the Koss but not that much. Panasonic also can be played on your stereo and they vibrate with bass on your head..this can be annoying though. The Panasonic are built though wires won't fall out and you can depend on them on a 110 rms system to deliver the better than paid price for the sound. They are ok no Sennheiser or Grado , Sony Mdr  sound quality.I choose the Koss for my Ipods and laptops... But I choose the Panasonic for a pretty good home surround sound system.  These are 2 different headphones. One is used for ipods and laptops the other is designed for everything. You like sound get Koss. You want everything with a lack in areas get the Panasonic. They are both constructed by someone who thought about the design. Boy is that important.",4
"If you don't mind looking like you should be listening to a Tears for Fears cassette on your enormous Walkman, these are fantastic especially for the price. Lightweight and comfortable with bass response you shouldn't be able to reasonably expect from open air type headphones, especially at this price point. I don't mind the eighties look to them, they rock in any decade. But tomorrow i do think I'll run in enormous striped tube socks pulled up to my knees, just to complete the look.",5
"I got a pair of sportapros, KSC75s and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver. And to be fair, I was confused. Each headset has it's own distinct feature and advantage. Very frankly speaking, the portapro's price is what I believe Koss cashing in on the hype, since frankly speaking I do not see the 50% increase in any way.That being said, the portapros do sound the best of the lot, because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage. I guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers, hence kind of ""closing"" it up a bit. The KSC75 have it in them to sound as good as these two, but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out, hence the huge drop in bass. Press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you'll get what I mean.Comfortwise, I would say the KSC75s win by a mile. You won't even feel that you have a pair of earphones on. The pads are good, comfy, and the same for all the three, but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the KSC75s.Sportapros definitely look odd. The KSC75s look uglier. Love the design idea of the sportapro though, the conversion to a behind-the-head fit is genius, and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it. The portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch, in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in. the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3.5cm to 1/4"" adapter as well. Packaging wise, portapro is miles aahead of the rest (well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros!!). The KSC75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack, but then again it's almost 1/3rd the price of portas.The only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the KSC75s, which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it, make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection.The KSC75s are the best bang for the buck definitely. But again, even the most expensive PortaPro is less than half the price of it's closest competitor from another company.But seriously kudos to Koss for making some of the best headphones I've heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on.",5
"I've read many reviews of PortaPro and have done some research for this headphones and other competitors like Sennheiser and AKG. I have to choose one of them because of limited budget haha. I chose this one because of my friend. He has Koss SportaPro which produces great sound and incredible bass. That's what I want. I'm very pleased with PortaPro. Very nice high and mid-range sound and impressive bass. I didn't say that this headphones are the best because some people still like Sennheiser or AKG. I think it is not much comfortable even if you adjust it to comfort mode. Moreover, even if you fold it, it's still bigger than pouch included in package. However, I chose PortaPro because of sound (and price). If you like powerful bass headphones and very nice high-range and mid-range sound, PortaPro will make you happy.",5
"Considering the price tag on these headphones, the sound is amazing. You won't find better sound for this much money. Even if you upgrade to something better, these are good to keep around for working out, doing chores around the house, etc., since they're lightweight and fit pretty snugly. I've owned mine for a year now and they still sound great.UPDATE: I've owned these for more than two years now, and I've treated them like crap -- wearing them when I work out, when I'm doing chores, working on the house, etc. They're INDESTRUCTIBLE, and they still sound great. I've gone through at least three pairs of in-ear headphones in the same amount of time. Buy these -- they'll last you years. You do have to get used to having a line imprinted on your head after using them for more than five minutes at a time, but I guess you can't have everything.",5
"Great sound for the price! Don't be alarmed at the style of these headphones because they are not the size of those big, closed back reference/Monitor earmuffs. These are the smaller &#34;Walkman&#34; style. I was surprised at the size, because the photos make them seem large. Good bass and treble response, but I can see how they could get broken easily. Just take care of them and they will be OK. A little weird trying to fit on your head for the first time.The package depicted (plastic clamshell) is not the package I received. I received a very nice upscale black box packaging with a photo of the headphones on them (in the style of iPod packaging).Pros - Lightweight and comfortable, even for people with glassesGood soundGreat priceCons- A little flimsy (mostly because of the metal band)Compared to my larger Audio Technica AT-30's they match up well. The main difference is in the bass response and loudness.It takes a little more power to drive the AT-30's so the Koss is louder The closed back of the AT-30's provide a little less treble and more of a &#34;surrounding&#34; live sounding bass compared to the Koss. But it is just a matter of preference. The AT's are also heavier and glass wearers will be hurting for sure. I'll keep the AT-30's for the studio and the Koss for general listening. You can't go wrong with the PortaPro's.",4
"These cans are not as good as my Grado SR80s; however, they are very good.  The bass is realistic.  The highs are crisp.  The midrange is balanced with the bass and highs.  I don't transport them very much; however they do fold up and store quite nicely.  One thing which I consider a real plus is the metal band across the head.  The band makes it absolutely simple to adjust the width, between ears, of the drivers without damaging the headset.  For a set of sub-$50 cans these are a great choice.  I've heard that the KOSS Sporta-pro isn't as good as these KOSS Porta-Pros.  If that is the case I'd stay away from them and get the Porta-Pro instead.  Unlike my Grado SR80s these drivers do not require additional amplification when used with my iPod or iPod Touch.",4
"The audio quality is crisp, basses are awesome. Im not an audiophile but i really notice the difference, which is big, between these and other headphones. The music played by these can be played at low volumes and i can tolerate. Very clear. One thing though, music is leaked really bad by these after bout 40% wich is bad cuz u know ppl can hear what you hear, and to me i dont like. Its plastic and aluminium, not the most durable of materials but hell with a lifetime warranty whos complaining. Its either these or some 100+ headphones. take these. Your wallet, and ears will thank you.",5
"Sounds good, but not great.  Will do the job.  Would not recommend for music. what else can I say about them?",4
"I bougt my KOSS Porta Pro in 1992 for usage on a Walkman.The day I bought it I believe must have changed my life ;-)Up to now (16 years !!) I did not find any portable headphone that delivers more sound.What makes this headphone so special is the dynamic it reproduces.The bass and treble that comes from this tiny package sounds like you are in front of a speakerwall.There are no words to describe the atmosphere it creates.When listening to classic music concerts its like you are there.When listening to a singer its like the stage is in front of you.When listening to pop, rock, disco, dancefloor, techno - you name it - it delivers the pump you would expect from BIG speakers.The clear vibrant trebles and the full deep bass it produces are just stunning.I still remember the first time I used those, the sound was so amazing it gave me this warm fuzzy feeling in the upper stomach area and left me speechless for a moment.Note that over time the earpads and the pads which are supposed to hold the headphone in place will wear out and eventually come off. This can be a major turnoff when you want to go jogging with it.I dont recommend wearing them long time or when you want to sleep (because of the pressure on the ears).The little blue ""comfortzone"" switch is supposed to set how firm the headphone is attached to your head. I don't think that's working as advertised, whatever the settings it didn't feel any different for me. The headphone is very light and foldable. When folded they are the size of a small apple.The headphone comes with a softcase.Summary:The speakers are not as compact as in-ear plugs but definitely have a better form factor than most pro headphones.The fact that mine are worn out after many years of usage but still used confirms that the sound itself is well worth the price.When listening - especially first time - be prepared to be left speechless. As mentioned above they have a few short comings (which product doesnt ?) but it is still a product with well deserved 5 Stars !!",5
"My only problem with these is a big one for me; comfort. After maybe an hour or so, they begin to really hurt my ears. People rave on here about how comfortable they are, I don't get it. I have an average size head, so I don't think my ears or dome piece is the issue. The circular foam pads around the speakers are very thin and the round speaker pieces underneath have hard edges that press through the foam and onto your ear. After a while it begins to hurt... not like make you bleed and cry hurt, but just slight dull pain from pressure. I have had these for about a year and use them daily at work. I still haven't gotten used to them, I doubt my ears will develop defensive callouses. Other than that, these have good sound and look cool for the money.Edit: I've had these for about a year and a half. I am so-so about them and definitely don't love them. They have not stopped hurting my ears, but I've gotten somewhat tolerable to it. FYI, back then I purchased the Grado SR-60s at the same time, and found them to also have the same super-cheap, extremely uncomfortable padding so I returned them. I kept the Koss phones since they were cheap and didn't require a headphone amp or purchasing an additional plug adaptor.I have been looking for on-ear headphones since then, so if anyone has any recommendations on an upgrade that's COMFY and sounds amazing, I'd love to hear from you. Happy shopping.",3
"For the money this is a good quality piece.  The wide metal band is durable but at the same time awkward because it is so wide.  There were only two problems.  One is that it hurts my ears a little.  But that is livable.  The other is that it advertises that it comes with a ""case"" which is actually a cheap plasticy bag that is slightly smaller then the headphones.  I really need a carrying case so I will have to find something else stronger and a little large so I can carry this in my pack without destroying it.",4
"Great sound out of these guys, they have an excellent bass reproduction, and treble is where it should be, overall a wonderful balance. The midrange is excellent, with instruments apparent I didn't know were there. They are also very light, so if you're confident enough in how they look, you can wear them around.the main point of my review was to say they are iPhone FRIENDLY, atleast the ones I got from Amazon directly.Would definitely recommend if you need something under a hundred dollars.",5
"I bought a set of the Koss Porta Pro headphones based on reviews for my Creative Nomad 2C MP3 player which I also got from Amazon. I don't think that a lot people realize that the limiting factor in listening to the MP3 format beside the size of the file is the set of headphones that you use. Although they are not as accurate as my Grado SR 60 phones, they sound very good and are light enough to be used on the go. For small headphones they sound pretty open and detailed. They bass is very good. So good in fact that I turned down the bass EQ on my MP3 player just a bit to bring the midrange forward and keep the voices from getting tubby. The treble is very clean sounding. If you got an MP3 player, do yourself a favor and replace the stock headphones with these. I am pretty picky about sound quality. The Koss Porta Pro headphones bridge the gap between light weight, portable and delivering a musical experience.",5
Night and day difference between these and either of my old Sony headphones. Blows away Nano earbuds. Money well spent.,5
"Yes, they look strange.  Yes, they look like a futuristic design from the 1980s--and indeed, they are from the 80s.However, for the price-range (under $60 or so) there is no comparison.  Still none.  These things have been on the market for ages, and folks still rightly rave about them.I remember using these babies on an old Sony Sports Walkman (tape) and the sound was amazing--big, fat bass, and loud.  These are unmatched for bass, period, in portable headphone in this price range.  They put the others to shame.Yes, they are bizarre-looking, and slightly awkward to fold up, and the metal clip in the middle might rip out a hair or two.  But if you're more concerned with the best sounding portable headphones for a Discman or an iPod rather than looking cool on the street with cooler-looking (but inferior) headphones, these things are perfect.  Highly recommended.  No accident that Koss (an American company, no less) hasn't changed up the design of these in ages--they don't have to.  If you want something a little 'sportier' and smaller, try the SportPro.  Not as powerful, deep, or loud, but excellent in their own right.",5
"For a, dare I say, cheap pair of headphones, the sound is great.  My biggest complaint is adjusting the fit is tedious.  The ""Comfort Zone"" switch always pops back to the tightest setting unless you first get the headphones situated and then carefully slide the switch while being careful not to bump the pivot point and pop the switch back to firm.  Also, the adjustable headband fights against it's own springiness and it's hard to make it hold at anything other than wide open or completely closed.  Finally, if you slide the headband adjustment while the headphones are on your head, you will almost inevitably pull hair into them.  If you don't plan on folding them up much for transportation, I would recommend looking at a different pair.",3
"I bought these after comparing multiple different headphones.  I was going to choose other headphones although the review on cnet changed my opinion.  There are really only two upsides to these headphones.  1)  They sound good, particularly in the low frequencies, and 2) they fold up small.  So what are the downsides?  1)  Any time you take them off they shrink back down to their original size.  You have to readjust them every time, which gets annoying fast.  2)  The things looks hideously ugly.  3)  Even though they have a setting to control how hard it squeezes you head, the pad above the speaker part rests on the side of your head and it will soon start digging into the side of your mellon.  Admittedly I have a larger than normal head, but these were very uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  I finally fixed this problem by bending the metal band out (a lot).  This modification made it so they don't fold up as small anymore.  4)  There is a hook above the right ear that you use to latch the headphones closed when stored.  This hook rubs on my ear if I'm not careful, which very quickly causes pain to the top of my ear.  5)  If the band adjusts while you are wearing the headphones there is a good chance it will suck your hair into the band which isn't a problem until you try to remove them, which quickly becomes unpleasant when you realize what has happened.  As a note, my hair isn't long, in fact I keep it with a military type crew cut, so this is a problem for anyone with head hair, regardless of length.Overall, given the choice to go back in time, I would have selected different headphones.  I got these on sale, and the price is pretty good, however they just aren't very comfortable.  Bending the top band helps, but then they don't fold up as small.  They do sound really good, but they also don't block out outside noises.",3
"These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable.  Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.PROS- Sound is great, bass and all.- iPod/iPhone friendly plug.- Lightweight and comfortable.- The price is right.CONS- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.",4
"I don't hear high frequency very well so take my sound review for what it is worth.  Good bass and mid-range sound;  very pleasant sound quality.  Crank up the power and they do not over drive or distort.  These are not sound expert headphones, but they sound as good as or better than the Bose over-the-ear head p[hones I have tried.  They fit comfortably on the ear but will slip some if one moves the head too quickly.  I like the durable head band molded into the plastic.  They fold up very nicely for storage in the bag.  Cord length is sufficient without being too long.  I like them but they were purchased for my grandson; now we will see how durable they are.  Great value for a reasonable price from Amazon.",4
"I have been debating to buy these for a long time. Finally I did and I am very happy I did.Sound is the best I have heard from this size headphones and it is also much more comfortable than I first thought it would be.I cannot tell how it looks, since I am wearing it. But who cares if the sound is so good.",5
"My girlfriend swears that these are the best headphones she's ever had. Call me crazy, but I feel as though they're starting to sound better than my Grado SR-80s too.",5
they work well and seem very strong. more than enough length on the cord and extremely great sound.,5
Surprising good sound for the money. These things sound too good to be used for workouts. They have foam earpads and those thing will get nasty with sweat. I use these at work and I couldn't be happier with them.,5
"Let me start off by saying I have owned these for many months and have enjoyed them thoroughly. The sound quality is amazing, clear voice, nice bass and not too much that it is overpowering. To the people saying they feel cheaply made, mine went through an hour in the washer and then into the dryer and are still working as well as they did on day one. They are fairly comfortable for what they are, they fit great under a hoodie, there is an adjustment to set it to your comfort level. I highly recommend.",5
Who woulda guessed that the best sounding headphones under $100 would be a portable version?,5
"I use the headphones to listen to TV and PC. They are lighter and smaller than the picture led me to believe, which is a good thing. The side foam pads, for your temples really help keep the pressure off your ear. But this pressure is also adjustable by sliding tabs on the tops of the headphone part. So you can get just the right amount of pressure. The sliding metal bands allow for a large range of size. With the sliding metal bands and a hinged earpieces the unit folds up to a compact size. I really like these but I never give five stars.",4
"The Koss PortaPro are great set of headphones for the ipod classic.  I read other people reviews and majority of them being very positive so I gave them a try.  Wow, the sound that comes from these headphones are great(no static/noise).  The fit of these is very comfortable and adjustable to any size.  I thought the metal would bother me( I shave my head) but no problem here I do not feel them.  If you are looking for a great set of headphone that will not break the bank and sound great look not further.",5
"YOU HAVE TO HERE THESE TO BELIEVE IT.  I WENT TO A BIG ELECTRONICS PLACE WHERE I LIVE AND THEY HAVE ALOT OF HEADPHONES ON DISPLAY AND I MEAN ALOT, I BROUGHT A CD PLAYER IN WITH ME AND THE KOSS HEADPHONES TO COMPARE, I TRIED SOME THAT WERE $100 OR MORE AND THEY DID NOT SOUND AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THESE. AND WHEN THE FOAM PADDING WEARS OUT, YOU CAN REPLACE THEM, WHICH YOU CAN NOT ON THE EXPENSIVE ONES, YOU CAN GET THE FOAM PADS THROUGH AMAZON ALSO",5
"the headphones are great, however a few issues that i had..... 1st pair, left speaker phone in-operative after 3 weeks use, 2nd pair, left speaker in-operative after 4 weeks of normal use. only other comment (not complaint)  the comfort zone adjustment defaults automatically to firm, and will not stay on the light adjustment. great speakers, poor design and manufacturing. companies like koss, do not like constructive, input, but I'll give them another try. after all, i live in Moog-ville, NC ,aka Bob Moog(god bless, r.i.p.) aka asheville, NC, former home to bob moog and current home to the moog museum and moog-fest and of course...asheville, nc ...music capital of the carolinas. peace.  love and joy....  btw, Amazon has been wonderful to deal with regarding my returns and replacements, that's why i continually shop Amazon, not walsmart or k-art or targot or bust buy. Shop Amazon!",2
"Sound of Koss portapros is truly remarkable.  Great sound for any price!  My one complaint is that they are a little heavy and not quite as comfortable as I would like.  Works best when clips on side of each headphone are pushed back for loosest fit.  Also, wish the headphones were a little more portable.  They don't really fold up as small as I would like.  Lest I sound like too great a critic, I would purchase them again.  In fact, I sent my son-in-law a pair for Christmas.",4
Excellent sound for the money. I only got to use them for a short time and wife discovered them. She loves them and won't give them back.,5
"I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug, these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $5.00 i could not pass them up. They're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices.",4
"These headphones are some of the best I've ever had!  Sound quality and comfort are excellent.  Where have they been all my life?  If you are considering purchasing these headphones don't hesitate, just do it.  They are well worth the money!",5
"I've had a terrible time finding headphones that I can wear for more than 5 minutes. First, I wear glasses, so that rules out a lot of ""over the ear"" headphones because it pushes the frames right into the sides of my head. The alternative, then, would be to use earbuds. I can't use earbuds though, because the insides of my ears are extremely sensitive due to multiple infections as a child. I didn't think I had an alternative. Fortunately, I came across these.For comfort, these things are a dream. I actually forget that I'm wearing them sometimes, which is a first for any headset I've owned. The pressure is applied above the ears as much as I'd like (it's adjustable) and I can change how much pressure is on my ears and the side of my head.Durability-wise, they *seem* to be fragile--specifically, the part where the speakers connect to the headphone frame--however I've often stuffed them in my coat pockets (yes, they're that small when folded up) where they've been squished against my shoulder bag and I've dropped them several times. It's all part of being a klutz. I have yet to do any damage to them, however. That's more than I can say about my portable MP3 player.Complaints: The bag seems a bit small, even with the ""correct"" way you put them in. I would've liked it if they made the opening a touch bigger so you could slip them in and out more easily. I've stopped using it altogether, but I use them every day for at least an hour so it doesn't matter too much for me.As for quality of sound, they've been excellent for me. I listen to a wide variety of classical, rock, and world music, and it's handled all of them quite well. I don't know how this would compare to, say, a $100+ headset, but for the price listed or under I think it'd have to be the best out there. For comfort, I'm not sure if these can be beat.",5
"My dad has had them for 10 years, they still work as if they were new. My bro has them, I've had them for a year... And have gotten 4 people to get them too.Nothing beats them, period. They deliver an incredible sound performance, feel great, don't leak too much, isolate a fair amount of surrounding noise, are unbreakable and extremely portable.Get them with no hesitation.",5
"At first my son wasn't sure about the retro look of these head phones.  Now that he saw them in person, he wears them everyday.  First pair came and the right didn't work.  Amazon quickly exchanged it.  Great deal",5
"I have been a Portapro enthusiast for the past 4+ years. You've already read the hundreds rave reviews of the Portapro's phenomenal sound and being that I am in agreement with them all, I have little to add. I have several head phones from different manufacturers such as AKG, Sony, and Sennheiser and these beat all the more expensive open air and closed air headphones I have. The only headphones that are better are in-ear variety which I use conditions with a lot external noise such as on planes and working out at the gym.However, recently I have fallen out of love with my Portapros and I think there are a lot of Portapro users who are in the closet about this particular design flaw that I'm about to elaborate on. First of all, let me explain that I have several mp3 players. Recently, I acquired mp3 players with large amounts of flash memory (16gb). Because of the long battery life inherent in these players (25 to 30 hours), I'm pretty much listening to them all day long, along with my Portapros. I wear these instead of the better sounding isolation earbuds because I need to hear the phone and be able to talk to people while wearing them.With my extended hours of usage, I've been noticing that when I remove my Portapros, about 7 times out of 10 they pull at least one of my hairs out. I have developed a method of slow removal combined with pushing together adjustable metal frame that reduces the instance of this. This acts to release any hairs that have been captured by the sliding mechanism. However, because many times, I have to answer the phone quickly, I find myself having to pull off the Portapros at more normal speed -- and this results in too many instances of unauthorized hair removal.Because of the great sound of the Portapro, I have been will to put up with it...until last night.Last night I was at Office Depot and on a whim I purchased the Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds (with the wind-up case) for about 10 bucks. These are the most generic basic earbuds that Sony makes. Over the years, I have owned several of these and my experience with them was that these were entry-level headphones with entry-level sound. But when I plugged them in, I was in for a pleasant shock. These sounded great. They must of done some design improvements since I last tried them. Excellent full spectrum sound for metal, jazz, classical -- everything I listen to. Tight, natural bass response that, in my opinion, is at least 97% of the greatness of the Portapro -- all for a measly 10 bucks. Better sounding than the other headphones I have that cost several times as much.Long story short...I've switched to Sony Fontopia's for the time being. The fact that they're not ""in the ear"" allows me to hear the phone and talk to people. But best of all -- no hair pulling.I still like the Portapros for their sound. In fact a week ago, I wrote an email to Koss explaining the problem and they politely explained they were working a solution that didn't compromise the positive qualities of the current design.That's cool. I'll be waiting. For now, I've hung up my Portapros. If there are other folks out there who have a problem with hair pulling like I did, the Sony Fontopia are a nice alternative for the being.Revision 2/28/2011In recent months, I've migrated back to using my Portapros. I'm just more careful when I take them off. There's nothing else like the sound on these babies. While I hope you guys fix the hair pulling, you're back to 5 stars.",5
"I've had 2 other pair of these headphones, and I've never been disappointed. The sound's great and they seem to last forever. The other 2 pair? My wife got one and my daughter got the other. They're especially good if earbuds don't work for you ... like they fall off your head a lot.Sennheiser MX-100s have great sound, too, but I had 2 pair of those and in both cases, the sound on one side went out. The first time, I got another pair of MX-100s, but the second time, I got the Porta-Pro. Can't imagine you'd be disappointed with these ... except maybe aesthetically. They do look a bit utilitarian.",5
"Oh Koss PortaPro, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:This pair of headphones is my favorite pair of portable headphones I've ever owned (just barely edging out my Sennheiser headphones I owned for years). They're highly compact and yet still pack a punch, providing rich full sound and, *gasp*, decent bass output as well (something severely lacking in most headphones). The semi-hard case is also wonderful. I very, very rarely leave the house without these headphones. They fit snugly and are barely noticeable, even after hours of use.My somewhat trivial gripe with this product is that, as a male with short hair, the retractable metal band will pull out a single hair every now and then. Very painful and somewhat frustrating, but not worth taking a star away,My family's been using these headphones for well over 20 years now and I've yet to find much better for the price.",5
"Recommended by CNET, these headphones are light, portable, and have the best sound I've heard in this price range.I originally bought them for a laptop, and now I use them on every audio device I own. Great product, excellent price.",5
"I have those for almost 1 year now and I just love them. They will not insulate the surrounding noise like the in-ear type phones, but they sound perfectly - very balanced (enough bass, clear highs and enough mids) and are comfortable to wear. I am finding myself preferring them among the 5-6 sets of different headphones I own for anything on my laptop and on my portable when I am listening to music evenings at home. Highly recommended for any purpose at relatively silent surroundings.edit: One earpiece easily broke when they fell from the table on the floor. Way too easy. Not that durable at the end. Taking some stars back.",3
"Purchased this to replace my $10 Sony ear buds. Sony is not bad, but sounds a little dry and boring. I was surprised to hear the sound improved even when connected to a PC. Bass sounds more natural (not over emphasized as woofers do), and mid-range sounds fuller. Yo-Yo Ma sounds better with this compare to Sony.Even though this is supposed to be on the comfortable side of headphones, I still feel uncomfortable after using it for a while. I think it is the case for almost any headphone.However, this is not the best for conversation. I prefer my cheapo ear bud for Skype, which sounds a lot clearer. This is not a surprise since all telephones actually do filtration similar to that ear bud's frequency response to make conversations clearer and save system resources.By the way, I got a chance to try a Koss TD-80. This Portapro beats TD hands down in sound quality. If you enjoy music, but not on an AM radio or very compressed files, give this a try.Update: to improve the clarity in conversation (Skype) or vocal, I cut a hole in the center of the foam pad. Now everything works beautifully. By the way, its cheaper to order replacement pads through Amazon. Koss charges $5 for a pair, while Amazon sells a pack for the same price.",5
"the sound is great, the fit is great, but the cushions are wearing off after while...well guess that is kinda expected and falls under normal wear and tear",5
"These headphones are great! I've been using them around town for about two weeks. They sound really good. The bass isn't overly punchy or  overwhelming but sounds really nice. The whole sound is very clear through the Linkin Park, Incubus, Pendulum, Bonobo, and some other tracks that I've listened to with these headphones.My only complaint is that they feel a bit flimsy and I try to be really careful with them. So far, I've dropped them once and they're fine.",4
I JUST NEEDED AN IMPROVEMENT FOR HOME LISTENING WHILE ON MY COMPUTER. THESE ARE BETTER THAN MY OLD ONES AND AVOIDS ALL THE POPPING SOUND.,5
"I agree that quality-wise and comfort-wise and portability-wise they are very good headphones. But they slipped off my hands one day and broke.Update: On the other hand, I mailed them back to Koss and got them replaced, no questions asked,",3
"These are outstanding headphones for the price, with excellent response across the frequency spectrum, and especially robust bass for such a small, lightweight set.  A friend recently visited me with a just purchased set of large, over-the-ear type headphones.  Though his cost nearly three times as much he was chagrined to find, after listening to a comparison, that the Koss headphones sounded better. A lifetime guarantee never hurts, either.",5
"I have owned two units so far and have gifted another one.At $50, you'd be amazed with the sound these deliver. I bought one years ago - and they worked fantastic until one of the side gave out. That was when I discovered the no-questions-asked lifetime warranty from Koss!I mailed them the piece - explaining what was wrong and about $8 s/h. And sure enough in four days they sent me a new unit!For the one I gifted, I was on the fence about beats, sennheisers, and bose on-ear. Tried them all out and personally I think the Koss ones sounded way better (and looked cooler too). I know the bose fans will hate this - but if they closed their eyes and didnt know which ones they were listening - I bet they would agree Koss sounds better or at least as good as the bose on-ear phones.",5
"I wear glasses and am very picky about over the head headphones. This one has nice design with support at the temple to relieve pressure at the ears, so doesn't push on the frame. Sound isn't bad either. I use it at office and when i go out for walks during the day and it feels comfy for extended periods of use.",4
"I've own Porta Pros since the middle 80's. They were my first good pair of headphones and I still have a pair today.Back when I first got them I thought these were a god send. They simply blew me away. I had never heard a pair of cans with such deep detailed bass. But then again I was used to listening to the cheap stuff that came with Walkmans. So the Porta Pros were a big step up the food chain. More then twenty years later and about five different pairs (the thin wire constantly breaks)they sound a little bass heavy to me now. I now do most of my listening with a pair of Grado SR60's. Much better all around but twice as expensive. My first pair cost me about $50 and that was as in 1980's dollar's. So if you take into account their current price these head phones are a real steal. And remember folks they come with a life time guarantee. The last two times that they stopped working I sent them in. The first time they were repaired. The second time I got a new pair. Not bad. But what they should really do is improve the quality of the wire. Even if it means an extra $5. I would recommend these to most but not to the very active or to folks who tend to break things, like my daughter.Love you honey.",3
"After reading a very positive review of these headphones in Computer Shopper Magazine I decided to buy three for use in my workshops and classes.I like their light weight, compactness, and great sound quality. Over time they may not take the abuse some of my students will subject them to. For now I am very pleased with them.",5
"I've had my Koss PortaPro headphones for about eight years now. They've served me well. I purchased them in Circuit City (one of the only local places where one could find them eight years ago) and they have traveled from iPod to iPod, served in some mild studio work, and have basically been the best set of headphones I've ever had. They sound great, they're comfortable, and they are durable.There's not much more to say. They're starting to wear out just now, and I guess I'll be forced to buy a new set from Amazon (or invoke Koss' lifetime warranty) within the next year or two. It's good that they're a bit easier to acquire now, and the price is about right.I'm no audiophile, but I do believe most people will find the Koss PortaPro headphones to be superior to just about anything in the same price range.",5
"These headphones are great!  I can't compare their sound quality to those headphones costing $5-600, because I don't have that sort of cash laying around.  What I can say is that these have a very wide range of frequency response, giving clear resolution to both the highest and lowest tones, and good clarity of vocals.  They are very light weight, and do not exert much pressure on my ears, or anywhere, making them very comfortable to wear for long periods.  And, although built lightly and compactly, they do not appear to be too fragile.  They actually do easily fold up and fit inside of the included 4.5&#34; x 5.5&#34; drawstring bag, making them highly portable.  They are just what I had hoped they would be.",5
"Got a couple of these for $25 each and my wife and I use them to watch Netflix and such. They are very good for what they are. Comfortable: secure without being tight. Easy to fold up for protection. Open phones make it possible for us to make comments to each other while watching (not possible with higher quality earbuds we have.) Especially if you find them at this price, go for it!",4
"I want to like these headphones.  I bought a pair of SportaPros and wanted a second pair, tried the PortaPros as they seemed to get slightly better reviews.  Now I am wondering - what are people listening to?  The SportaPros sound so much better than the PortaPros that I have to believe something is wrong.  No depth or layering or punchiness to the PortaPros.  Portas are mostly defined by over-response in the treble range.  I'm getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channel.I've heard all about the ""burn-in"" for headphones, but the Sporta's haven't needed that and I'm not sure how much time to waste on these Porta's.  I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD238 which beat the heck out of the PortaPros but are somewhat on a par with the SportaPros.  Now the Senns seem to be sounding better with more use as I did not like them as well out of the box, but do now.  Or my ears are getting ""burnt-in"" to their sound as I think happens also.Is there something wrong with my PortaPros?  I have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones I have.** Update 1/28/11 - another thing with these phones - the channels are reversed!  Listening to ""All I've Gotta Do"" by the Beatles (old stereo, music one side vocals the other) I have 3 sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel.  On these, it is reversed (and yes I do know how to put them on, triple checked etc).  WTH is the deal with these?** Another update - A1 Accessories is sending me a replacement pair today even though I've already lost all my original packaging and stuff.  So many thanks to them for so far great customer service.  I'll post on the new ones when they arrive.** Update 1/31/11.  Quick service from A1 Accessories to replace my headphones and now the sound is much better.  Now I can compare these to my other phones and the sound is definitely comparable (and channels are no longer switched).  I am finding that the Firm - Light settings are very touchy.  They don't want to stay on the ""Light"" setting easily but that is a minor problem.  I am now much happier and have changed my stars review to reflect this.",5
"I adore these headphones. They are definitely the best portable/lightweight headphones I have used. Amazing frequency response across the entire range. Very comfortable, even if you're wearing glasses. The lifetime warranty is a big plus too.",5
"I had a pair of these and broke them then sent for another pair,the replacement pair was not made the same and don't sound as good as my old pair,these are made more cheaply by far and are not near as good as there old model",2
"Not even sure writing a review can do these headphones justice, exceptional; is the first word that comes to mind. These are not just good for the price, they are just good. There is always a satisfying feeling I get when I feel like I received more than I payed for, and that is exactly what I received here. Very highly recommended.",5
"Excellent product in every way.  This product is light, easy to use, comfortable and excellent sound quality.  All in all worth the money.",5
"Just as lots of others have said here, these are great-sounding headphones. They're comfortable, and they stay on my head while working out and doing chores that require a lot of repetitive bending, like laundry. But I only bought the pair in Nov 2012. Now here it is June 2013, and one side just died completely. I don't have the ""paperwork"" so the warranty is useless. Lesson? Next time, keep the ""papers"" and register the headset so that if they break again, I have some recourse. Also, the price is now about $5 higher than when I bought them last year.",3
"Get the SportaPros instead.  They look better, can be worn in a street configuration, cost less, and sound exactly the same.",4
"These are ugly as sin, but comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is excellent - so much better than the Sony's I replaced with these!",5
"For sound quality, you would be hard pressed to find something as good in this price range. True, there's a few products out there (some Senn earbuds come to mind) but you could spend a lot more and get something that doesn't sound this good. Don't expect any isolation though, these are open to the air (as most of the best sounding headphones are).For comfort, they are so-so. They're not the worst I've used, but the band isn't particularly comfortable. The design is also prone to catch hairs (I have short hair so it doesn't bother me so much, but once in a while it catches one and rips it out).The styling is very 80's, which, well, makes sense, since they were designed in the 80s. I guess that is good or bad depending on what you like.Oh, the &#34;case&#34; they come with is useless. You'll never get them to fit back in the case. I think the bag itself is physically large enough to contain them, but the opening is not.",4
"I'm admittedly sort-of a brand-whore when it comes to sound. I like my Klipsch, Sennheiser, Grados, etc. I dislike BOSE for the cheap materials, over-marketing business model. I'm annoyed by Beats headphones that are just Monster headphones with Dr. Dre's name and over-boosted bass tones - but sold in awesome bright colors. Hey, I respect that Beats is bringing attention back to cans, I really do, but they're not good sounding headphones.I have a nice pair of Sennheiser noise-cancelling headphones I can't always wear due to headaches from the noise cancelling feature. Also if I'm doing activities, the Sennheisers are huge and cumbersome, not practical if I'm running, washing my car, or otherwise moving about quickly. I have a great pair of Klipsch earbuds, and those are fantastic for running. But they have poor bass response.The Koss PortaPros are fantastic, almost mixing the best of both and leaving out the extras. It does not sound as nice as the either of the above mind you, but you won't be left complaining. The bass response will destroy those of any earbud-style headphone, but you know that. Koss' drivers are more than capable of handling the meager power they receive, and they do well to replicate bass from an on-the-ear design.The downside? Yes, the looks. Hey, they're not bright-colored pastels that scream ""LOOK AT ME!"" In fact, they are ugly and say ""stay the hell AWAY from me!"" but if you're not buying headphones for the image (and you really shouldn't be), then you shouldn't care. They look dorky for a reason, though: each side has a switch that allows you to set firmness, allowing the buds to ""flex"" outward. This makes for very comfortable wearing. So if you're not trying to impress the kids at your high school and instead want to save some money and get good sound, check out the Koss PortaPros.The best part is they're so inexpensive, if they ever do break or get lost, stolen, etc.... you don't care.  If my brother lost his Dres, he'd kill somebody. But my PortaPros? It's $25 bucks man. I just go order another. :D",5
I bought these headphones thinking I was moving up slightly from my Koss Sportapros. Wrong! They are a half step down in sound quality.  Specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a 'tinnier' sound.,2
I ordered these for an upcoming cruise to use on the plane and the ship both. Have tried them out on my laptop and for their size they sound great. Not as nice as the noise cancelling ones that I keep at my desk at work but then again their not as big and bulky as those either.,5
"Don't let the design deter you...These headphones produce excellent sound with good volume, bass and frequency range. For the reasonable price, I don't think you will be disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones. Also, they can be compactly stored (designed to fold together) and carried within included case.Okay, the bad...They're not the most comfortable ""over-the-ear"" headphones with a pretty tight feel and a bit difficult to adjust. Also, the metal/plastic headband slide has grabbed my hair a bit without following through with a kiss.When I first started using headphones (over 40 years ago now) Koss was the brand to get. This still seems to be true today. Overall, these are very good sounding headphones for a reasonable price.",4
"These are old school small headphones and are not particularly stylish. OK, they're ugly. That said, the sound is waaaay excellent. Get over it. Do you want sound better than 'phones costing 4 to 8 times this much or do you want to be stylish? At $32, you've really got to give them a try. Don't be misled by a few average ratings, because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites. I have a good music system, plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card, and these headphones rock on both.",5
I know these headphones are not as cool as Dr. Dre's but they have excellent sound and bass. They are comfortable to wear and store easily. Highly recommended.,5
"i bought these a the px 100's and girlfriend pick the px 100's i got these, i like the style and the sound is a huge step up from the ipod in ear phones. i also dig the warranty that koss gives these. i have to admit the sound is a little more defined on the sennhiesers(how do you spell it?) but the difference is not worth quibbling over. you will be happy with either pair, but the px 100s stay in place on her head better (ive got a bigger dome) so if you have a small head go for those.",5
These Koss headphones are well priced and nice audio quality for MP3 quality recordings. Not good for noisy environments since they are open style and relatively small but very comfortable for long sessions of use.,5
If you don't have these headphones then you bought the wrong pair.Bose is nice these are nicer. Bose cost 299.00 these are under 50.00 and sound better.No they are not noise canceling. Yes they are more comfortable.Okay so they are the ugly ducklings of headphones but they sound awsome.  These are my third pair. I just wear them to death.They Rock the head!,5
"This is the 4th pair of these headphones. THE CONNECTOR PROBLEM has been fixed andthe sound continue s tobe freat. The 6nit curls up into easily transported ball. I can, t imagine flying withojt them.",5
Fro the price these are hard to beat. I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point. Lifetime warranty as well.,5
"I've had these headphones for around a year now.  They are great sounding and quite durable.  They feel kind of cheap but even my 12 and 15 year old sons couldn't break them (they break or lose almost everything i get them).  The most outstanding feature of these phones is the smooth and accurate sound you get from them. I use my pair with a zune mp3 player.  They blow away the standard ear buds, as well as my monitor headphones and the skull candy headphones I bought.  The only complaint I have is the styling.  Since I'm not trying to make a fashion statement, I have to give them 5 stars.Jan. 31, 2012: I have owned these headphones for over 4 years now and I have to say I love them as much today as when I got them.  They have held up quite well with only a small problem developing at the plug end of the cord.  Where it enters the plug end the rubber has become frayed.  I remedied this with my hot glue gun.  I was going to send them to koss under the lifetime waranty but didn't feel it was worth the shipping costs.  I just bought new cushions because the old ones are quite crushed at this point.  Everytime I go to the store to sample headphones I come away thinkig these sound as good or better than the ones they have on display.  Ive tried the sony's, skullcandy's, klipshe, etc.  The only ones I like better are the more expensive (over $200) sennheisers, bose, bowers and wilkins, and audio technica.  I haven't heard the grado or beyerdynamics headphones so I can't comment on those.  For portable use you would be hard pressed to find a better headphone.",5
"The fit is both tight and comfortable; very usable on pretty much any exercise machine.  Earbuds aren't an option for me given the weird geometry of my ears, and these are just perfect.  The folding design works well in a gym bag, too.Plenty of bass, and more than enough volume when driven through my cheap MP3 player.  I wouldn't mistake these for my dearly-departed Grado SR60s, but they're half the price and much more portable.I had a pair of these in the early '90s, and loved them back then too.",4
"3rd set, what else can i say lol ... they have always been a little heavy on the base but as a work horse they are perfect",5
"When I was much younger, like 18-20 I had a pair of Koss Headphones that I bought at a local music shop for like $15.  I've never had a pair of headhpones i liked that much again.  They technically still work, but I broke the connection between the headphone and the head band.I've been using SennHeiser 201HD's at work for a few years now.  BUT the bass was never terribly pleasing.  I had decided to buy a more expensive set of headphones and was reminded of my old Koss Headphones over Christmas.These things are amazing.  The base response blows the Sennheisers out of the water (and yes, I know they are twice as expensive) the comfort unbelievable.  I have even taken them to a local radio shack and they sounded better (TO ME) than the 249.99 Beats they had on display.I gotta say, these things rock. Frequency response is unbelievable in a cheap pair of headphones like these.",5
"Porta Pros can be broken easily but mostly is snapped back ,Audio Technica Under $ 1oo great too for under $",5
"I recently went though a spate of headphones -- 5 pair in this price range.  This is by far the best sounding of the group (by far!) and I find myself using them the most often.  As a matter of fact, they sound better than my studio headphones (Audio Technica) that cost about $100 more.  The only problem I have is that they can get uncomfortable after an hour or two of use, and they stick to your hair.  If you have long hair (anything after a 1950's crewcut) they will stick to your hair and pull it when you adjust them and take them off.Totally worth it -- great sound and all -- as long as you don't mind the problem with the ouchy hair...",4
"I was reasonably happy with the sound and comfort, but after a year of use, there's a loose connection near the plug that makes one channel cut out.  I'm really sick and tired of the disposable nature of every pair of headphones I buy.",1
We've had these headphones for about 8 years until the kids finally finished them off when trying them.These headphones are great for using in gym. They designed in the way that the pressure is distributed between your ears and your scull so that they are fixed firmly when you're jogging.The sound quality is simply amazing for their price. The design looks sort of dated but that's because they've been produced without change for more then 25 years now.I've bought the same model now to replace the broken once.Highly recommend.,5
"No wonder these phones have been around for so long. I was surprised when I heard them. I mean for the money you spend I feel you get more quality sound then not. All ranges sound really good. The low end I felt was really nice to hear. All ranges come out good. About the down side. Well, I don't feel I have room to complain. They have a lifetime warrantee. You don't need any RA#, you mail them to Koss and they either repair or replace It. This was a large part of my deision In buying these. They have short wires and the wires are thin. Would of been nice If they made them with an exrta couple feet of length. You do need care to handle them cuz they seem a bit fragile but so long as you take care they should last.Would I recomend them? Yes I would!",4
"Reviews are great, sound is great, comfort is awesome you almost can't feel they are there.However, some geek has decided to skip the two different methods of plug, that have worked just fine since plugs were invented.  Instead of a plug going straight in, or a plug with a 90 degree bend, they have decided to be cute and have used a plug that has a 45 degree bend.  In one great flash of brilliance (insert sarcasm here) they have managed to get the bad features of both other plug designs.  It sort of sticks out and it is sort of able to follow the line of the player.  But not quite.If I keep these, I will be rewiring to a standard plug.BAD IDEA KOSS!  Otherwise great headphone with a great history, now with an odd little glitch.",4
"Having recently sold my Sony MDR-V6 headphones (good cans but no longer practical for my purposes), I succumbed to the frequent hype surrounding the Koss PortaPros and ordered a pair, as a back-up to my Sennheiser PX100s and, if necessary, as a replacement.They certainly are no replacement, and I have yet to decide whether to keep them as a back-up.  Headphone judgments can be highly subjective, but here's one consumer's observations:1.  The PortaPros have a reputation as ""retro-stylish"" but providing cutting-edge, compensating sound quality.  My first impression upon wearing them, even before connecting them to a CD player, was that the comfort level is not equal to the PX100s.  I was highly conscious of an awkward tin band around my head and frankly baffled by the resistant 3-level ""Comfort Zone"" switch.  Admittedly, the initial sense of discomfort dissipated once the sounds of my player were picked up by the headphones.  They're indeed high efficiency (demanding less volume than the PX100s), producing an open, ""non-canned"" and transparent sound in the mid-range and offering  impressive detailing of the acoustic double bass on the low end as well as the drummer's ride cymbal on the upper end.2.  I began doing numerous A-B comparisons, noting that the PortaPros were immediately more arresting, producing bright, ""forward"" and ""instant"" reproduction of all frequencies, at times making me wonder if the PX100s weren't just a trifle muddy.  But soon the PortaPros began to sound slightly ""edgy"" and ""aggressive""-- less balanced in their overall sound compared to the ever-pleasing Sennheisers.  Then an Achilles heel became unmistakable on a CD on which the PortaPros began to break up on the notes of the double bass unless I backed off on the volume by 50%.  With the PX100s the same CD produced only the slightest hint of distortion, which vanished when I cut back on the volume by a mere 10%.  Soon I wearied of the comparison: the PX100s had won the argument, and rather convincingly at that.  They're slightly more cumbersome to fold up and reinsert in their hard case than the PortaPro's (at least without practice), but that slight downside had never seemed more insignificant.3.  Neither of the above headphones would be ideal for monitoring or DJ work near a microphone,  the PortaPros more so because of their extreme sensitivity, which would certainly invite feedback.  For that sort of work, I depend on the largely overlooked Koss UR40s.  For comfort, frequency range, balance, and long-term wearability I would take these full-sized (but extremely lightweight) headphones over not only the PortaPro and PX100 but the Sony phones mentioned above. The UR40s handled the overly ""hot"" bass with absolutely no incident or rollback requirement.  Their weakness is shoddy workmanship (I'm on my 2nd pair): the head webbing came detached after a couple of months' use and the conducting wire is both excessively thin and short.  (If you purchase either Koss, be sure to save all of the order materials to be able to avail yourself of Koss' famous lifetime guarantee).",3
"Bought my first headset by Koss (KTX/PRO) Titanium at least 8, maybe 10 years ago.  Got it at a drugstore for about $15.  It finally failed a week ago.  Not completely, just wore out foam ear covers and developed a spotty wiring problem.  I was faced with replacing the best headset a picky, PICKY audiophile like me could find.  I spent a lot of time reading reviews and bought this one.  And BOY am I a happy camper!  Don't waste anymore time.  Get this headset.  Rich, deep base, clarity, no distortion of sounds in background.  I cannot imagine a headset that could sound better than this one.  It's extremely comfortable.  The wiring is a lot thinner and I may worry about damaging it.  Only disappointment was the ""case"" included.  It's not a case but rather a black bag made of a synthetic material.  I folded the headset to try to use the bag and stopped.  I don't want to cram like crazy and damage the headset to get it in the little bag.  I'll use the bag for other electronic gadgets. My old reliable Koss headset came with a volume control, and this one is missing that dandy feature.  That's the ONLY thing it's missing.",5
"I have been using these for about a month now. I have done some traveling, working out, and simple listening at work with the Porta Pros and I love them so far. The bass is great, the sound quality is wonderful for a tiny portable set of headphones, and they are comfortable on my ears.I would definitely buy another pair.",5
"I've owned these for 5 years and they still sound great.  Lifetime warranty, crisp sound, good base for portables, sturdy, comfortable.  Get them.",5
"I am disappointed with the sound quality from this headphone. It does output strong bass, but overall sound is muffled. The high is very weak, barely audible. I prefer the Koss KSC75 and Sennhauser PX100 for they both produce a more balanced sound than the PortaPro.",3
"I find earbuds to be very uncomfortable. These Koss Portapros were perfect for replacing the earbuds that came with my MP3 player. They are comfortable to wear, have great sound for the price and have a little stylish pizazz. They are easy to fold up and put into a suitcase or purse for travel. I'm very happy with my choice.",5
"these have very good sound.  relatively comfortable on head.  I like being able to hear surrounding sounds, so I appreciate that.",4
"I have two sets of these headphones - one has been my companion in my gym bag for about 15 years, and the other has gone traveling with me over many trips in my computer bag as well as used frequently at home.I probably have a dozen pair of good to excellent headphones, including various sennheisers, grado sr 60, shure, super.fi pro 6, sony mdr v6 and v300, etc.Honestly these Porta Pros do not offer the best sound quality in the world.  But they might be the most comfortable.  And the sound quality is pretty darned good with excellent bass for a headphone so small.  They are easy to carry around, and I have found them to be surprisingly durable.By comparison I also have the Sennheiser PX 100s.  The Sennheisers are OK, but not as comfortable and the sound is more muffled.  I always go back to the Porta Pros.  In fact, no matter what ever headphones I try I always go back to the Porta Pros.These have been around a long time, but no one has yet made a better portable headset.  Usually I don't like to jump in with a me too review when there are this many people who have already written a review.  But these headphones are that good, and I recommend them to anyone with an ipod or other mp3 player.",5
"YES, I know they have a lifetime warranty. But, I have to pay shipping there, and shipping $6 back. So for a $30 set of headphones I have to pay a third of the cost to get a replacement.That said, great bang for the buck with audio quality. Good bass, but clear, not boomy like cheapos. However, the cord frayed within 2 months, and I'm hearing occasional audio go out. I think the quality of the build is a 2 out of 5, but the audio is 5 out of 5. Be aware you are getting a cheaply made product that outperforms the price. I'm personally going to look to switch over to grado's or something that seems more durable.",3
"Sounds good enough, even to a discreet audiophile - at this price point. I use it to listen to itunes on my laptop and it sounds far better than the laptop speakers. It sounds especially decent when listening to jazz, classical music and ballads. DJ/Dance Hall music and the like sounds good too but would sound even better with more bass. The head phones are a very good all rounder. Go ahead and get it if you are on a budget.",4
"A relative got this model Koss as a gift and absolutely loved them, but finally, the thin cord broke loose, so he purchased another pair and sent them back because the ones being sold now are NOT THE SAME ones as he got before and are so cheap and flimsily made that he knew they would not last.  The cord for one thing is a lot more flimsy and thin and there is more plastic.The photograph is showing the OLD model Koss and does not depict the newer version of this same model which is not made as well and was quite a shock when he got them.",1
"I was looking for a pair of headphones that had great sound quality and that didn't cut out all ambient noise.These delivered in all aspects and won me over with their vintage appeal. The sound is bright, crisp, undistorted and they are also very comfortable while wearing eyeglasses.I was tempted by Vintage cans like the Sennheiser HD414s but the used prices are a little hard to justify when compared to the Koss PortaPros. The HD414s also need a powerful amp for them to shine and I'm just plugging into my Mac and iPod most of the time.The Koss PortaPros are the ultimate in retro chic and for the price you'd be hard-pressed to find another set that rivals their sound quality and design.",4
"These headphones are great and it's a &quot;anybody's choice&quot;. It's firm and light. Solid headbands(metal).Pros :-Cool-Firmness is great! Firm, mild, and &quot;did you see my headphones?&quot;-Portable-Light designCons :-Cheap cord(ask me for a pic)-The plastic on it may seem solid, but drop it once and it breaks! (ask me 4 pic)-Plug in form of &quot;v&quot;. This makes it easy to tear off. (ask pic 2 see difference)-Sound slightly above average, but no competition against PanasonicI really hesitated when I saw it, I knew that it would break. And I was right, a fall of a meter and there's my money flying by. I highly recommend to people who are careful and one last tip, fold the headphones so that it doesn't break! Don't fear breaking it by folding the phones close to the metal bands and bending the thing like a metal bar. I like the design, but I wished that the body was metal only, not plastic!The three stars missing are for the bad cord. It's cheap. You're supposed to be careful and not dropping it once and it's over... otherwise it's a must buy!",2
"I've been through so many headphones, and many have sounded fine (such as this set); however, what's the point of having a decent sound when the construction itself doesn't last more than a year?  Honestly, I think I'm done buying low-priced sets with their fragile construction.  And by this, I mean that (in 100% of the broken cans I've had) it's the wire connection to the plug.What bothered me the most about this set was that I never really used it in any aggressive manner.  It's just time and movement of any kind has weakened that connection.  It shouldn't be the case.Regardless, I'm late to the game on reviewing this product, so I don't expect to change anyone's minds.  If you're in the market for a cheaply made but decent sounding set of headphones to get you through a short-term period, this might be recommended.  For my part, I think it's time to spend more and shoot higher.",3
"I came to these headphones after coming from $180 Shure E210 earbuds that broke and these headphones are certainly on par, if not better, than them.  I loved my Shure earbuds and I love these a heck of a lot more.  The sound quality is superb and while there have been complaints about the bass for some, it's definitely not a deal breaker.  Personally, I appreciate the little extra bass these give.  It's not overwhelming, but it is noticeable that these headphones have more bass than others.  There are two major things that people may be concerned with with this product:1) The adjusters at the top of the band catch a few hairs on your head and may pull a few out as they're being removed.  Having short hair is beneficial with these headphones, but if you have long hair, simply hold the adjusters in place as you remove them and remove them gently.  You'll have no problems otherwise.2) These headphones leak sound just like any other headphone of this type.  If this bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.  The sound leakage isn't super loud or annoying, but if you're in a quiet room and listening to rock music at a moderate level, a person a few feet from you will notice you're listening to music.Otherwise, the sound, the comfort, and the price makes these headphones worth it for anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones.  They easily stand up to headphones within the $150-$200 price range and sound just as good for a fraction of the price.  No, these are not too good to be true.  You won't be disappointed.",5
I've had two pair of these.  Lost the first pair and replaced them.  Light weight and great sounding and easy to store with a life time replacement warranty.  You just can't go wrong.,5
"These headphones are an amazing value and very well designed. The headphones are small, yet the design is such that they firmly yet comfortably fit on your head. There is a small button allowing adjustment of how much pressure is exerted. The drivers are nicely padded and there are pads that sit on the temple, ensuring that the drivers sit parallel to the ears.The sound is superb, especially considering the size of the phones. The bass extension is very good and satisfying, much better than comparably sized phones. The overall sound is neutral and non-fatiguing so that you can listen to them for hours at a time without getting tired.One thing to note is that headphones typically are ""open"" or ""closed"" design. A closed design uses heavy pads to block out external noise and are meant for use in noisy environments. Open headphones, like the Koss PortaPros, are designed for use in quiet environments. So if you want phones for use in the subway or the airplane, these are not designed for that type of use.Another very important feature of Koss phones is the lifetime warranty. I have had my Koss PortaPros for over 10 years now. I have accidently snagged the wires and ripped one out. I sent them back to Koss with a check to cover the nominal shipping and handling charge(see their website for details), and they promptly refurbished my headphones, and even put on new pads to replace my old pads! Other manufaturers would have forced me to buy a new pair of phones. So if you expect your phones to take some punishment during use, the lifetime warranty is a big plus.Those interested in small, open style phones may also want to check out the Sennheiser PX100, which delivers similar performance, though the PX100 has less prominent bass and more mid-range; the typical Sennheiser sound. Both are excellent values but in my mind, the extra bass output and lifetime warranty make the Koss phones a slightly better deal.",5
"I have been modding and testing headphones out for the past 2 years and these are my favorite. They can be used for any genre you can think of. Excellent sound all around and they aren't even burned in yet. Highly recommended for comfort and sound!Update: I am returning these unfortunately. Although they are great, they are not so good for exercising. I didn't even attempt it but if you get sweat inside the ear cushions, it will go straight to the driver. They are great for portable use still as well. They also were a little tight on my head, even with the light mode on. The light mode also wasn't working very well. I have a bigger than normal sized head though. If you have a normal or small head, these would fit great. It just clamped too hard for me. While I still recommend them, they are just made way too cheaply and hurt my head.",4
"Bought these to replace a pair that gave up the ghost after 25 years. Best investment then, and now. A classic like this should never die. Hopefully they never will.",5
"When I lived in Sweden, about 50% of the population had these headphones. They were extremely popular. Now I know why!The sound quality on these things is amazing, comparable to $50+ headphones. The only headphones I have listened to so far that have better sound quality are some more expensive Sennheiser headsets. The bass is really booming, and there is crisp treble and pretty nice midrange.They are extremely portable too. I can fit them in the pockets of my shorts when folded up.Pretty durable cable too, and it doesn't twist.I highly recommend these!",5
"Fair sound, great price, and the collapsed form factor makes them quite transportable.Will update this review in a few months after seeing how they hold up.",5
"They been making these the same way since before I was born and they haven't changed a thing.  After years of loyal service I finally abused my pair to death and I wouldn't order any other headphones to replace them.  They're lightweight and I often forget I'm wearing them. They do great bass simulation and I can hear instruments I can't detect on other headphones.  There are some downsides too but none of them are dealbreakers.  It has a weak size adjusting slider that can snag your hair and the dated 80's design is kinda ugly.  They have no noise cancellation, so sound will start to leak before my ipod reaches half volume, and for something called the Porta Pro, they aren't particularly portable.  They fold up, but they don't fit in your pocket.  Still,  you can't find a better lightweight pair of  headphones in this price range. They work great and except for the occasional hair snag,  they're comfy,  but best of all they won't break the bank to deliver a quality sound.  Take the Pepsi challenge and compare them to other headsets.  You'll see there's a reason they've earned a cult following.",5
"Take what other reviewers have said about these headphones, believe them, and then multiply it by 100. I received a pair of Koss UR-20s as a gift years ago and loved them  so naturally I looked to Koss again when replacing my portable/on-the-go headphones. After buying a pair of KSC-55s, which sounded great but were uncomfortable for me personally, I hopped on Amazon and found everyone raving about the PortaPros. I figured they were good, especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the 1980s (which has to mean something), but I also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true. However, these are bar-none the most amazing headphones I have ever put on my head. Listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those 'wow' moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely. The bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light, comfortable headphones.I don't know what I'm impressed with the most: the amazing bass, the excellent stereo division, or how loud they can get! These things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more... I was worried about the eighties styling, but in person they don't look bad at all. I hate headphones that scream for attention, but these don't look like that when you have them on and I have already been wearing them in public (something I didn't think I would do after only seeing the picture of them online). And even if they're a bit outdated in appearance, the design is so functional you won't even give looks a second thought after you put them on.One thing is for sure: these things have plenty of bass! Not too much (not ""boomy""), but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without ""bass booster"" turned on, which I like. Even with the bass settings adjusted high, the bass remains clear and crisp. I'm not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them, but I listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all. After a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that I cleared out with canned air. Something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones (so someone nearby could definitely hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up loud).Others have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling, but I have a very large head and they fit me without a problem. However, if I will be wearing them for an extended period of time I always set them to the ""Light"" setting on the comfortZone control (which divides the side pressure of  the headphones with your temples rather than just on your ears).I already had headphones I was pleased with (Sony MDR-G52s and Koss UR-20s) but I wanted a set of small, portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect. The folding design isn't something I necessarily wanted, but it is nice. The carrying case they come with (a leatherette bag) is a slightly tight fit and I probably won't end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing. Some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken, but compared to other small headphones I have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weight.While I wouldn't say these are bad things about the PortaPros, it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head, and that they don't fold down as small as you might think they would so don't expect to put them in your pants pocket or something. Considering these are the worst things I can come up with to say about the PortaPros, they are nearly perfect in my book.I can't say enough good things about these PortaPros! They're simply amazing. These are the first headphones (or speakers) I've had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass. They sound good on everything from R&amp;B to Country and everything in-between. I've been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill, tinny treble that plagues so many headphones. If there ever was a question about the quality of Koss stereophones in my mind, these PortaPros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer! If you're like me you'll wish you had discovered these legendary headphones (haha! how often is that said?) years ago...",5
My family is hard on headphones. This is the only pair of headphones of any type in my household that has made it six months. The Koss PortaPros are comfortable and have a very transparent sound. Highly recommended.,5
"These may be a throwback to the seventies, but the sound is great. The only concern you might have is that they don't block out much outside sound and, since the cups are open, they allow those around you to hear what you're listening to if you really have it cranked up",5
"I wanted good headphones that we over/on ear with good balance of sound at a reasonable price and these headphones worked out perfect. I got these to listen to music and podcasts and found these handle the full range with out being too bass-y compared to Dre Beats or other high-end headphones. I have found that many high-end headphones bill themselves as such because they can produce a lot of bass, but end up sacrificing range and clarity. I wanted a pair of good headphones and were looking at some sets that were &#62;$150 and decided to take a shot at these.These work for all types of music which I have tried classical, hip-hop, rock and roll, and dub step.I used them at work and a couple of times at the gym with no issues in either arena. They will block out the background noise of the gym and the pads don't soak up sweat like other headphones I have ruined in the past.Two issues are the looks and the comfort. The looks are something you will get used to. I have found that these can get uncomfortable after wearing these for a couple of hoursProGreat soundGreat bassGreat rangeGreat priceConLooksComfort",5
"I bought these headphones after my Koss earbuds finally developed a short after many years of use. I stayed with Koss because I had been very satisfied with these earbuds as a significant improvement over the apple earbuds for an ipod. And I was hoping for a bit of an upgrade with these headphones. But I didn't expect this significant an upgrade. When I first listened to them I was a bit overwhelmed by the bass. I had some concerns with an overly heavy bass because of some reviews mentioned this. But the more I listened, the more I loved it. I was simply hearing the bass in a way I had been missing with my earbuds. And I mostly listen to jazz with these headphones so it's not like I'm looking for a heavy rock bass here. I was just very happy to hear the bass as well defined as it was with these headphones (right now Gary Smulyan's baritone sax sounds amazingly full!).. And the rest of the sound is excellent as well. My only regret now is I'm getting used to this much bigger sound so I'm less blown away by what I'm hearing than when I first made the upgrade. But I have only to listen to some earbuds to get that &#34;wow!&#34; feeling again.Another feature which attracted me to these headphones which didn't dissapoint is their portability. I like to take my earbuds/headhones with me when I travel and don't want to lug big headhones around which take up a lot of space. These headphones fold up into a kind of ball which almost fits in the palm of my hand. And they're very comfortable to wear. The &#34;comfort zone&#34; settings come in very handy. Moving the setting from &#34;firm&#34; to &#34;light&#34; makes a difference you can easily notice in how the headphones feel. I find that I prefer the setting right between the extremes (there are three settings in all).So, unless you've got something against '80s style and are concerned that you're just going to look too wierd with these things on, they are the perfect listening device to use with an ipod (or, at least, that's what I use them with) that combines great sound and portability.",5
"Yep, it's old style that is back in-style!  These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!",5
"Still love the Porta Pros, which play in the much more expensive leagues when it comes to sound. Koss really nailed it with the Porta Pros, which are much more valued in Europe, I found out from a friend. Excellent warm sound, a bit bassy but not enough to ruin the experience, not at all.",5
I bought this from Amazon specifically for my twenty hour airline journey. Most of my music I hear is lossless format on IPOD (converted from CD using EAC software). I am a guitarist and musician and use various studio monitors and get very easily disappointed by bad quality. I am very impressed by the tightness of the sound coming out of the headphones. The bass is well defined.The headphones are very comfortable to wear and for a guy with a shaven head thats an important criteria as well :-)I will definitely recommend these headphones to friends.Lastly the price just blew me away ! Koss could have charged much higher than this but someone out there is a Music Jedi :-) May the force be with Koss.,5
"Sound is. Great.Price is great.A little fragile, but take care and it will give you a light weight headset with full sound.",5
"I bought these two months ago after reading all the rave reviews and was not dissapointed. I'm amazed that PortaPro are just $30. I own a pair of V-moda in-ear phones that costed me more than double the price, and a pair of Seinnheiser PMX60. I can safely say that PortaPro are FAR superior sounding than the other two. The best part is their bass. Mids and Highs are great as well. Pretty comfortable to wear. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is their 80's look. But headphones are for listening, so I'm over the looks. Highly recommended.",5
"I was a little skeptical at first because these are cheap (paid about $40) and the design is a little different, but WOW. The sound is phenomenal... I make my friends that have the ""Beats"" and ""Soul"" studio headphones (who also paid $200-$400) listen and they are jealous of the huge sound! Unless you just want to blow your $$ on those to get a rapper's brand name, get these!Summary:PROS:-HUGE soundstage-- great bass, but not overpowering. Good clarity in mids and the highs can sparkle if you want them to, even with bass! Brings music to life--hear it like never before.-Interesting design, get lots of questions/compliments.-PRICE -- are you kidding me, $40 for this high quality? thanks Koss!-comes with decent case and headphones are collapsible to easily carry in a backpack or pocket even.CONS:-cord seems a little short, but not bad. about 4 feet. I'm used to longer cords on studio headphones.-keep in mind these are ""on ear"" therefore let outside noise in a little. Also keep in mind you can turn these up REALLY loud. lol.Highly recommend these little headphones. If you are in the market for anything under $400, get these!",5
"Ok here goes.I won't waste much time on the looks as you pretty much see what you get which resembles a $15 set of phones from the 80s.I'm ok with the looks if the quality is on mark.Overall these look pretty cheesey as the cords as well as the plastics are very thin.I worry about the plug coming apart.The sound is good and has nice bass response.Mids and highs are not over done as I like quality bass over cymbals thrashing etc, and it has a warm and acurate tone overall which I like.The fit is good and is adjustable,but tends to want to reset if you use the""light""pressure setting unless you take them off just right.They do fold up very well though.The chance of grabbing your hair is real though not a big deal.Overall they have a comfortable fit.These do little to hold outside noise out or music in,so others can hear your music and you can hear them, which is ok as I expected this from the design.I wanted to write a review as almost all reviews praise these to god-like status in this price range. They are very good and yes they get better after a break-in.For this money they should be on your short list.It appears people have luck with these lasting for years and are a product really worth the price for once.Update 07/2012Holding up and sounding great!",4
"I got these because the low price, good sound quality and they are collapsable.They do all those, they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable. They pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time. I stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust.",2
"I was due for a new set of headphones, and as I despise earbuds, I searched carefully, and found these superb phones from Koss. They are not expensive, yet if you are particular about your music, your  ears will hear sounds other headphones could not reproduce.  I can wear these all day and they are not so large you look like a relic from the 70's.  They fold closed and come with a leather-like bag.  The bass is clear and not muddy, the highs are clean and not painful to the ear.This model has been in production continiously since 1984 without change!  Koss hit it right with these!",5
"I had a pair years ago and lost them. If you want a solid pair of headphones that sound excellent these are the headphones for you. I can't believe how many have bought into the Beats headphone hype.. with their muddy bass and  sound decay at high volumes. Save your money on most headphones selling in the $300.00-$500.00 range, Koss sound just as good if not better. The only issue, what's up with the mini case? It's a - - - - getting those phones into that little bitty Koss bag, make the case LARGER.",4
"I have owned a lot of headphones over the years, and I have never found any reasonably priced headphones that approach the sound quality that these have.  Yes, they aren't exactly stylish - the design dates from the 1980s and it shows.  But there is a reason why they are still for sale after all these years.  You don't survive in a business as competitive as consumer electronics for all this time unless there is a reason for it.They aren't perfect for all occasions - I wouldn't go running with them because the old-school foam pads would eventually get sweaty and nasty.  You could use them on a plane, but they don't have any sound-isolating/noise cancelling features and they don't isolate your ears.  But for like commuting on the subway, at work or to watch movies on your laptop after your wife is asleep, they are perfect.  Good base response, but nicely balanced throughout.  Crisp, not muddy at all.  They hold up well if you don't abuse them, I had a pair years ago and they lasted a long, long time.",5
"I am most certainly not an audiophile but these headphones came highly recommended not only from other sites but from other people I know. They are a classic design from the eighties which is now nouveau chic again.I am a heavy heavy tech user and like to use high quality items and I demand a lot from them.With that said these are my new favorite headphones (the one's that travel with me everywhere).I was skeptical even after reading all the reviews, thinking ""How could something so reasonably priced really be as good as all of these reviews suggest."" Well they can be and are, consider my doubts banished as I was pleasantly surprised. The reviews are correct, this is Koss' masterpiece, homerun, the epitome of what Koss represents.I have a pair of Bose Triport Headphones and Senneheiser PX200's both of which are excellent headphones....and these Porta Pros are commandingly better (the Triports are ""warmer"" and the Senneheisers crisper, but I like the sound of these best as they are the cleanest clearest balance of warmth & crispness).They are light weight, foldable, exceptionally comfortable and of coarse the sound quality is excellent.Actually, I cannot say enough about the sound quality, it is well balanced, full, hits the highs, lows and everything in between accurately. They produce clean scratch that pristine audio that is a pleasure to listen to. I find myself searching out music that can challenge or push these and they just keep on producing beautiful music to my ears.Essentially they are awesome. (period) They sound and function better than headphones easily two or three times their price, look cool if you're into retro and they are dirt cheap.CONCERNS:The only concerns if any are that the part that connects the earpiece to the headphone part doesn't seem very robust and may break eventually(though I haven't had any issues). Some may find that the metal headband might catch on their hair (something else I haven't had an issue with, though I have short hair) and finally, the foam pads over the earphones sort of scream I'm cheap and I will wear out on you. In defense of them, it does keep with the whole retro thing, it's really comfortable, it's easily replaceable, and they are in fact inexpensive, essentially who cares. Many of these small things have been ever so slightly adjusted on the Anniversary Edition of these gorgeous nearly perfect headphones (but for twice the price I wouldn't bother). Oh and Koss has an included lifetime warranty for the life of the product, ridiculous!(amazing) For me this tosses basically all of the concerns out the window.Conclusion:-Beautiful design and function (form and function married beautifully, just one of those products that is right on, balanced, perfect in most ways) Clearly the designers got it and knew what they were doing when they made these.-Koss' famous lifetime warranty.-Worth every penny, I would feel good about paying twice the price and wouldn't bat an eye. Awesome part is you don't have to. I would buy them again, for myself or others.",5
"Four star sound quality for under $50. Very comfortable, with solid construction. The review on cnet.com is spot on. I could not be more pleased with this purchase.",5
"Title of this review pretty much sums it up. The bass is a bit too heavy, for my liking. However, the overall quality is very good.  My son took a listen and he loved them.  He and his sister have a birthday coming up, so I think I will pick up a couple pair. Good value for the money.",4
"I've been using these for many years, mostly for playing music during workouts.  I am a fan of really high end headphones (Sennheiser 595s) and, although my Koss phones aren't quite up there with them, they really do satisfy.  Great bass, great presence and you could run over them with a car and they'd still work.  When I bought these (more than ten years ago) the dealer (whom I trusted) said ""these are the best.""  He was absolutely right.By the way, I recently listened to the headphones currently marketed as Koss Porta Pros.  Happily, Koss hasn't changed a thing.Tom Hurley",5
Sound is good overall but these don't wear well.  Miniplug connector shorts out and earpads keep popping out of their cheap plastic plates.,2
"I'm a headphone nut and have $600 worth of high-end headphones lying around (three pair).  I also have a pair of Koss Portapro2s, which are identical to the Portapro other than lacking part of the adjustment mechanism.Despite all this high end audio goodness around, I still use and enjoy the Portapros.  They offer maybe 60% of what my other headphones have, for 1/5th the price (and are much more portable, of course).  I've owned and enjoyed several pair over the years including the Radio Shack iterations, and have always been wowed by the sound quality.  They were my introduction to ""better than stock earbud"" sound.I think they would be a better deal at $20-$25, but they are still worth the money at close to $50.  The bass can get a bit overbearing at times (I'm no basshead), but otherwise they are excellent.  Also, note that they are completely open, and perhaps not the best choice for noisy environments like on a plane or bus.",5
"I gave it 5 stars because for the price, these are about the best headphones you can get sans a good sale. I recommend it to anyone who wants a great pair of headphones you don't need an amp with.",5
"Sound is great for such an Extremely lightweight headphone; Construction durability remains to be seen.  Very fold-able / portable. Love-Hate wear procedure - bit of a nuisance: Because of the thin, spring headband, you Must spread out the earpieces all the way (you can't just slip them over your head and ears); wear the headset; and Then tighten the head band and click-adjust the Comfort buttons to get a good fit.  Great $ value with KOSS' Lifetime replacement warranty.  Appeared flimsy on first blush, but on the other hand, it is very flexible and should survive most abuse.  However as mentioned in other reviews, the cable insertion points at the ear pieces do appear vulnerable-fragile and Should have strain-reliefs which is present at the plug-end of the cable (Note for KOSS).",4
"A high-quality headphone like this is something that will change the way you hear music. The full, bold, clear sound it produces is heavenly. I've been hearing all my old favorites, songs which I've heard THOUSANDS of times, and in many of them I notice sounds and instruments I never picked up, not in my JBL speakers, not in my old crappy Dell speakers, not in any of the other various headphones I've owned.It is very comfortable to use, very adjustable (it has adjustments on both arc length and speaker angle) and looks durable too, even with all the folding it needs to perform to fit in the small bag it came with.",5
"I have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time. Koss offers a an excellent product.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  Sounds a little heavy but still very listenable.  Please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music. Highly recommended.",4
These headphones sound great and the price can't be beat.  I use them frequently.  I did not give them 5 stars because they can get a bit uncomfortable after extended use (2+ hours) and they do very little to block the sound from being heard by anyone close by.,4
"I first tried these headphones in the base exchange while I was stationed in Germany during my tour in the service.  I compared them to a dozen brands they had, including full ear ""professional"" sets like AKG and Sennheiser. As mentioned previously, these have the most incredibly tight and full bass. The tweeters put out crisp, clear highs -- especially brass. I bought them on the spot and wore them daily until one day I accidentally pulled the wire out of the phones. I sent it back to the factory with $5.00 shipping and had them back, good as new in less than 2 weeks. The earphone mounting design, while comfortable, is not very sturdy. The earpieces snap into the headset and have a central pivot point which is made of plastic of course.  Well, I broke that piece and the earpiece would not stay on the headset so I sent them to the factory with $5.00 and they fixed them again and shipped them back quickly, good as new.  Bottom line, when Koss says ""Lifetime Warranty""...they mean it.  I still have them, actually I'm on my third set now and if these wear out, I'll buy them again. Oh, and did I mention they sound great too!",5
You know how noisy the NYC subway is? This product is totally amazing block out the noise but still can hear the announcement. Nice deep base too.,5
"Koss PortaPro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular, of course you do not expect it to be at the price. A great value.",4
"Product arrived as scheduled and nicely packaged. Had my doubts with the Koss brand as I never believed it was a premier brand. The sound is very nice and balanced. Good bass and not overwhelming. The design is a little outdated but I grew up in the 80's so it is fine with me. In fact used the headphones to watch one of the cult classics, Fast Times at Ridgemont High on Amazon Instant Video. Good bang for your buck and definitely a true value.",4
"I have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 Panasonic to $100 Sony, with Sennheiser HD 433, 202, PX100 II (I really wanted to like these PX100-II, they were so very well designed), and even a Grado SR60 for awhile.  And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.  It's just a *slight* bit boomy, but you get to like it after a while to be honest.The design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out.  It could use a update but it seems like Koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past.  I don't really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it (I have very short hair, even for a male).But despite it's design flaws, it's the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, and the best part is that it's also the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard under $75.If you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you, there is nothing even close to this at this price range.This one is an absolute GEM.  I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.  It's supposed to be for better compatibility with the iPods and iPhones out there.",5
"Based on all the reviews I thought this was going to be a nice set of cans. Unfortunately I'm very disappointed. I'm comparing them to the Sony MDR-V6, which in my opinion rates against headphones in the $200+ price range.The PortaPro is not a bad headphone, but its not a good headphone either. The bass is present but muddy. Not clear or crisp at all. The mids have a decent amount of detail but the muddy bass bleeds the mids out quite a bit. And the treble.... where is it? I haven't heard a headphone with less treble. This lack of treble futher leads to the overall lack of detail and excitement found in other headphones. Are they worth the $25 that I paid? Yes. But I wouldn't pay more than that for them. Save up and buy the ~$67 Sony MDR-V6, its several tiers above the PortaPro, not only in sound quality, but in noise isolation and build quality. If you can afford the Sennheiser HD598, I also very very highly recommend them as well.",2
"Happy with Koss PortaPro. Light, comfortable, adjusts easily, great sound quality, while allowing to hear a phone next room ringing.What Porta name has to do with it, beats me. Not sure what to do with the little bag enclosed, or the fatter adaptor bushing that came with it, but a nice touch.Happy ears.",5
"My old Sennheiser PX-100s were finally dying after about five years and it was time to find a new pair of jogging/traveling around headphones. The PX-100s were great, but with the success of that product Sennheiser changed the headphones somewhat and jacked up the price so I figured it was time to tryout their Koss counterparts. I'm a big fan of the PortaPros, they have punchy bass, mid-range is good and the treble is not too piercing. The result is a very good product, though I have to admit I don't like the sound quite as much as the Sennheisers. I think that the main problem is the bass, it's good, but the Sennheisers had a dynamic, fat bass sound that the PortaPros can't quite reach.  I'm a fan of a variety of music, and in rock and jazz tunes this slight deficiency is not apparent at all. With electronic music and, in particular, hip-hop, the limits of the bass show up. I should say that I do have perhaps an over-fondness for low-end sounds so it's possible that you'll like the fact that the bass isn't as strong with the PortaPros.  I will also say that while I don't like these PortaPros quite as much as the PX-100s, I don't think that the PX-100s are worth their new $50 price tag and I would purchase these Koss headphones again if giving the choice.",4
"For the price, these sound great and are comfortable.  I can wear them for hours without problems.  The bass is surprisingly decent for those few songs that need it.  I like the open ear design for use at work as I can hear when people are talking to me.  The whole package is much smaller than it seems in the pictures with the ear pads just barely covering my ears.My biggest complaint is with the portability, or rather the compromises made for that portability.  They fold up decently small and very easily.  This ease means that all adjustments that you make are immediately reset when you take the headphones off your head, even for a second.  Since I use these at work, I just keep them at my desk and don't need them to fold up.  I'd rather that they didn't so I could adjust them exactly how I want and never have to bother again.EDIT October 2013: I've had these since July 2011 and they still sound great, but I have run into a few issues.-They tend to unfold in my bag if I take them with me.  Not a big deal, but it tends to tangle the cord when that happens.-The plastic pieces that hold the two halves of the metal headband together started to unsnap and fall apart.  It was annoying to keep putting them back together, but some superglue has fixed the problem.-After 1.5 years, the cushions have fallen apart.  They're pretty thin to begin with, so no real surprise, and replacements are under $5 for three pairs, but kind annoying.Still, I'd buy another pair if I had to.  Maybe a non-portable version.",4
"I have had these for about six months now and gotta say that they're great value for money. I listen to death metal, classical, jazz, classic rock, trance, ... and these do all of them justice. Mid-range guitars don't sound muddy, bass is punchy (could be a bit bass heavy for some) and highs are not screechy at all.The thing is, the design hasn't changed a whole lot since the 80s when they were first introduced. They are open-air headphones, meaning that they leak sound...both ways. So don't wear these on a subway or in a loud area, as they do not block out sound at all.The adjusting mechanism hasn't affected my hair as much as others here, but it is still an issue. Extend the phones beyond your head size, then adjust down. This way your hair won't get pulled out as often.The cord is pretty thin and the plastic construction means that you gotta be pretty careful with them; I've knocked them around a bit in my jacket pockets and backpack though and haven't had any problems.With regards to comfort, I wear glasses, and many other headphones press my ears to my head so hard that my glasses indent the sides of my face. Not comfortable at all. These, thanks to those weird-looking comfort pads above the &#34;ear&#34; pads, don't.Other headphones tend to make my ears heat up. Not these.Overall, a great pair for the price, and the portability just makes them that much better. 5/5.",5
"I agree with those who say the look is retro, but I have to say the sound is fantastic, especially for $30.! I compared it to my full size Sennheiser which cost considerably more and the sound was great. When playing various styles of music you'll find it does sound better on pop/rock/country music compared to classical music, but it was no slouch on the classical side. It really brought my laptop to life, whether it was music or a movie. I would suggest you carefully put it on to avoid pulling on your hair, but that wasn't too diffucult. My son tried it and he wanted to trade the Sony's I gave him, I told him he was out of luck!",5
This sound much better than Sennheiser PX 100 (owned for about 2 years). It is comfortable on me but I just don't like style. PX100 look better.,5
"I bought this as a gift, so the largely negative feedback was really disheartening:*it sounds worse than cheap $5-10 total crap earbuds*it looks so futuristic*it snags hair*it takes quite a bit of force to pull them apart for putting on head*the same tightness that makes keep squishing together and inhibiting easy donning of them puts some unnecessarily pressure on the head and negatively impacts comfort.They're getting used.  So used, when I asked to borrow them to verify sound issues or find some resolution to the issues mentioned, they have not been produced so I can assess what's up.  If they sounded that bad and were that annoying, then I would have handed them to me for a return the first week.  She hasn't even managed to give them to me to check them out and now I can't return through Amazon.",3
"The sound from these headphones is top of the line, its a pleasure to listen to my music with these phones. They are light on the head and stay that way using them for extended amounts of time.  Dislikes;  I don't like having to adjust them each time I put on my head but you soon forget doing the adjustment soon as the music starts. The cable is a little short for me but works. I would recommend these phones but you have to be gentle with them especially with the connector.",5
"I've owned many different headphones before, including aSony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil(an incredible headset in its own right) and listened to some high end sets that friends have including a set of AKG K701 Studio Headphones, and these are, easily, my favorite. I will always love my Sony MDR-V6, but due to a recent change in my listening needs, I needed a pair of open cans, portability being a huge plus. I considered the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone but those didn't really look very comfortable, and aren't particularly portable. I gave these a shot, and considering their price and heritage, why the heck not?I have absolutely nothing but praise to say for these cans. They are amazingly comfortable, probably the most comfortable set of cans I own. The ComfortZone system really works, and allows you to balance pressure between the ear pads and head pads. Why Koss or another company hasn't implemented this system in newer sets is beyond me, it allows you to releive the pressure on your ears when your just kicking back and listening, or increase the pressure when you're moving around. Of course, these aren't sport phones and are less than optimal when you're very active, for that I would recommend the less comfortable but acoustically similarKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones. I haven't found the headband to be uncomfortable at all, but I do have quite the thick dome of hair protecting it. You might think this would cause the hair pinching problem some have complained about, but I haven't had that problem yet. The portability is respectable, they do fold up into, as someone says, a pokey baseball. The case is pretty worthless and too small, but whatever, its really not necessary. The looks, well, are subjective. I think they're very unique and in a way personify the anti-""Beats by Dr. Dre"" look, which in my book is a great thing, but most normal people might not agree. Who cares what they think :)And of course, the most important aspect, the sound quality. I find these sound absolutely excellent. The response is geared more towards listening pleasure and not flat response, so these won't be any good at studio monitoring or mixing, but they also don't need a ton of EQ adjustments to make listening enjoyable, unlike my V-6's. Personally I only bring up the extreme lows and highs just a little bit, and they sound great like that. Very detailed, bright, punchy, and excellent response across the entire spectrum, except for the extremely low end of the spectrum. To get solid response in the sub-20Hz region, you're probably going to have to find a closed set or a set with larger drivers. It just comes down to the limitations of physics at that point. Other than that, the sound is amazing, there's really nothing else to say. Just make sure to give them a good long break-in period.A word of warning I should mention, is not all of them come from the factory in perfect working condition. The first set I had poor bass in the left channel, in about the sub-100Hz range. This is one of those defects that's hard to detect since bass isn't directional, and for awhile I though maybe I was going crazy. I was able to isolate this by listening to each side individually (by pulling the other away from my head) and was able to deduce the problem with the left channel perfectly using that method. Amazon was great about the replacement, and my new set is perfect.My only criticism about these cans would be the way Koss packs them. They wrap the chord up so tight I doubt the kinks will ever fully come out. I observed the same quirk with the KSC-75, Koss needs to either start wrapping the chords less tight or use a more pliable rubber in the chords. This annoyance is really the only indicator of how affordable these really are. Replacing the chords with a better quality set would probably be a worthwhile mod, and one I'm considering doing. Then again, that would probably void the excellent lifetime warranty.Overall, these are an amazing set of cans. There really is no excuse whatsoever not to give them a try; they've been made the same way for over 25 years, and once you use them, you realize why they shouldn't ever change a thing. They're a true legend, and even if the price was double what it is, they would still easily be worth the money. Recommended without any reservation whatsoever.Oh and a note about the photos, the actual plug is a gold-plated straight plug, unlike the steel right-angle plug in the picture. The 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter is entirely gold-plated as well.",5
"I needed a replacement for broken KSC75 and decided to try these. I didn't find PortPro very comfortable, they press against ears a bit too hard for my taste, so I couldn't wear them for too long. But! The drivers can be easily detached and attached to KSC75's clips! This combination turned out to be very comfortable. Why not just buy cheaper KSC75 then? Well, the sound of PortaPro drivers is a step up. Unlike some other reviewers state, as far as I can tell, the PortaPro drivers are the same as KSC35 and NOT KSC75. They do sound different (to my ear), with PortaPro/KSC35 being more detailed and crisp but still retaining rich, warm, bassy (is there such a word?) sound I like so much about KSC75. You may also consider KSC35 which is basically PortaPro drivers with clip-on instead of headband (as far as I can tell Koss only sells them directly from their website).",5
"Bought my wife's pair in Sept. 2011. They are still great.Bought a pair for me in October 2013, and they are trash.Koss changed the molded connector from a strain-reliefed right angle stereo mini plug to a straight one.The wire insulation separated just outside the molded strain relief.If yours arrives with a straight connector, SEND IT BACK.We are very easy on there... use them to listen to iPads in bed. That's it.Very disappointed with new production.So I read that Koss has a warranty; just send them in WITH $9!$9 for return shipping?That covers the total production cost including return shipping.The connector overmolding is no better than a $1 set of ear buds from epay.I'm replacing them with Sennheiser PX 100-II. Thanks Gizmodo.",2
Amazing sound at an amazing price.  They are more bass heavy than the KSC75. Together they compliment each other very well!,5
"I have been listening to headphones over the past 30 years or more. From AKG, Sony, B and O, Bose, Senheiser and among others (such as the overpriced Beats by Dr. Dre)  After listening to earbuds i have found that the sonic quality, price and comfort cannot be beat at this price point. For less than $50 including shipping these headphones are a dream to listen to. With the adjustable temple force you cannot get anything better to listen to music from many different sources. I don't abuse headphones so these will last me a long time.",5
"just received these-i ordered directly from amazon after receiving a fake pair of the red ones on ebay.  **i suggest buying these through amazon, not other sellers***  do not try to save a few bucks and get ripped off.  i would not even purchase them from amazon sellers-again, buy the ones through amazon directly.  please do some online research to see how to spot a fake.  if you have any inklings that you may have gotten a fake, contact KOSS.  they will not refund your money, but will try to find the seller and deal with it.  these are really good headphones for the price.  i also have a pair of sennheiser 202s that were a tick cheaper, but they are not as clear as these.  not sure how they will hold up, but KOSS' lifetime guarantee is really great thing i've read.  again, be sure you're getting the real thing-there are fakes out there (biggest issue is bad spelling on packages-KOSS would not do that).  glad i did online reasearch as this pair i received from amazon sounds way better than the fakes did.  do not make that mistake.  buy from a reputable seller. hope this helps you-great headphones-LOOK OUT FOR FAKES!!!!!!",5
"A classic headphone that should be in everyone's collection ..These headphones have remained the same for the last 20 over years ...Recently, it has finally been made to allow iPhone users to enjoy these with the mic function.",4
"This little headphone produces beautiful sound with comfort, I liked the retro look and think it's cool. After reading so many positive reviews and saw it on sale for under $25, why not? I am so glad I did, the shipping took longer than expected, about 2 weeks but it's worthy of the wait. IMO, this little headphone sounded better than Beats and Sol at a fraction of cost. I am a little picky about audio sound and wouldn't buy a car without a great audio system, skipped Bose, went  for HK Logic 7 for my car. Love this little Koss and highly recommend it.",5
"I won't say anything more than the positive reviews here. I have had a pair of PortaPros since 1998. I use them everyday to go to work on the trains. I literally wear them out in about a year and a half of heavy daily commuting use. The great thing is if you catch the cable on something or drop the ear pieces and they start buzzing or break something, they come with a lifetime warranty and you can send them in to Koss and they will send you a replacement all for $6. I have done this about 5 times in 9 years. Try that with Sennheiser!!",5
"So many good reviews so I will keep it shortI have 2 models of Koss,Koss Porta-Pro (semi-open design, bass is plenty, light and easy on you ears) these are very comfortable and I am wearing them now :) Koss ProDJ100 (Closed design, a bit more detailed and more of a solid bass but not boomy) I find I use these for gaming allot as well as Music and find them Very Clear :)",5
"Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.I love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!",5
"First, these are not intended for loud places. You should be using these for a study, or library reading etc- not in a busy loud place. These are in no way intended for blocking noise- you will end up turning them up loud, and hurt your ears. But anyway, these are nice. Found em via Cnet. Easily fold up, but don't realy fit in the bag- i never have really needed it. As for comfort, you can't even tell they are there. As for sound- great highs, and not bad lows- all around goodness. Lifetime warranty was the selling point for me- i have already gone through about 10 or so pairs of the cheap skull candies- i would rather have something i could depend on. Just 9 or so bucks to ship and a new pair- i haven't had to do it yet, but it is there when i need it. All and all, awesome.",5
Awesome low freq definition. Highs are equally good. For the price ..its absolutely unbeatable. Haven't yet found anyone beat these old babies. I had already tried some good stuff like the Klipsch custom 3. Porta Pro rules,5
"I've had the same pair for 5 years. Here is all you need to know...1. They are durable.-I put them in my backpack with huge math books every day for school.-I have spilled coffee on them.-I have kicked them, and pulled on the cord with my feet by accident.-My fat friend stepped on them.-They have dealt with volume spikes and loud sounds.After all of this they look and work perfect.2. They sound great!-I own a pair of 8"" studio monitors, professional stuff. These don't sound quite as accurate, but I still choose UR20's over my monitors a lot of the time, and enjoy the UR20's immensely.They are durable and sound great, what more could you want? :DPlease rate this review as helpful, otherwise, leave a comment letting me know how my review could have been more helpful. Thank you!",5
"Ok, i searched for some headphones that were Over-Earred and durable...these headphones are look and sound Excellent! I can't believe i used to have a pair of Sony MDR-zx100, i know you can't compare the two, but these headphones are my personal favorite headphones that feel and sound amazing in my ears. 5-stars! Thanks Amazon!",5
Great headphones.  Comfortable but not especially lite weight.  I would purchase again.  I like the single cord.  xxx xxx xxxx,4
"Wish I would have bought a different pair, as now I'm back on here searching for replacements.The sound of these is decent, but you'll find the cushions fall apart quickly and the pair will end up in a landfill after little use.Do yourself a favor and buy something more durable.",2
"These Koss headphones are such a great buy. Less than $20 and u get a very comfortable fitting set and great sound too. These, of course, do not have audiophile quality,  but for the everyday Joe who wants good sound and fit at a great price these are the ticket. ;)",5
"Have had these for over a year after getting them for a good deal (although more than the $15 they are going for right now) using them daily, sometimes up to 4 hours or more in a row for listening to music while surfing the net or playing video games, and I have been nothing but happy with them.But I recently strayed.  I bought a pair of audiotechnic m50s after reading all the great reviews, and guess what?  I like the Koss UR 20s BETTER.  I was shocked.  Yes, the audiotechnics unquestionably separate the different instruments better, give a crisper sound overall with a slightly punchier base and cleaner treble (for $100+ more they ought to, but the mids are quite recessed and the music more sterilized and not really more enjoyable to listen to, and more than anything, they weren't even close to as comfortable as the Koss ur 20.  They began to become uncomfortably hot like an ear sauna after about 15-20 minutes, and the overall enjoyment of listening wasn't $100+.  I sent them back immediately and am listening to music right now on my Koss ur20s.For $15...  and needing them for just listening to music or movie watching, I just can't even think of a reason not to have a pair of these for around the house or at the computer.  So comfortable I could sleep in them, sound is good with these huge cans, and no ear sauna.  While true audiophiles may need to look elsewhere, They are great for everyday listening and use.",5
"I suppose you shouldn't expect ""spectacular"" sound at this price.  The headphones are well made and comfortable.  All in all, worth the money.  I'm satisfied.",3
"No jarring, No overly crazy treble sounds, and yet deep and rich.I have been using this headphones for about 2 1/2 years and i have found Its pretty good in sound reproduction and does not break/damage easily.Its also very soft on ears and does not pain the ear lobes like Sony or others do.The headband is supple, yet strong, meaning it will be firm over your ears, but not paining.Comes closest to noise-canceling feature because it covers your ears completely.",5
"The first time I bought these was about 6 years ago. They are still working just like new, without any distortion. Comfort of these is amazing. Few days ago I have ordered another pair and some ear cushion replacement. The best headphones for the price!",5
I have these hooked up to my computer because I listen to Radio and watch NetFlex while I shop or read.  These work great as far as blocking the TV noise.,5
"It's good, not as good as my other senheiser ones, but for the price it's really good, it compares with headphones that cost 2-3 times more, if the size does not matter. well isolated from outside world sound.",3
"I'm not a audio-hound. I bought these headphones to watch movies as I don't listen to much music. These phones have a great sound. Like others who have noted the enhanced bass, I love the bass. I view them as no-nonsense headphones. They delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models (as these are very reasonably priced). For example, they do not have the sound adjustment switch on the cord and the cord is coiled so you're not always dragging around cord that's continuously getting hung up on something. The only down side I have noticed is fairly peculiar to people with, how shall we say, over-sized heads. They are comfortable. The foam totally encloses the ear so that there's no sound loss or outside sound distractions. But I do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped. The head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion. To put this in perspective, I have a pair of PhillipsSBC HP250s that I can't wear for more than 30 minutes without getting a headache. I also have a pair of Panasonic RP-HT355S that are far more comfortable but aren't as comfortable as these. Other than that small inconvenience, I would highly recommend these phones, particularly to people who don't place high demands on audio tolerances but just want to watch a movie with great sound. As a matter of fact, I am considering getting a second set to take to work to listen to talk radio.",5
"works great for my needs, but I'm not a fan of the coiled wire and angled plug. thankfully the coil is a softer compound so it doesn't pull on my head during use, but I would have preferred a straight wire. I know I know-- &#34;it was in the details&#34;. Well, I admit I apparently didn't read them all.the angled plug is more an issue, since a straight plug fits my needs better.I shopped Koss based on another Koss headset I bought. I'd buy Koss again (obviously).",4
"I trusted the Koss name that these would sound decent, but was surprised they sound as good, and are as comfortable as they are. I have a much more expensive set of a different brand and these sound comparable, and are definitely more comfortable. (These were a Christmas gift for my mom... she's very happy with them, too.)",5
"I think this is a very good sounding and comfortable headphone.  It is light, and you can wear them for hours without feeling pinched.However, it is made out of cheap hard plastic.  The first pair broke after a year, and its replacement just broke again.  So on average each pair lasted for about a year.  Both time, the plastic pieces broke and the headphone practically flew apart.Good thing is Koss offers lifetime warranty, $6 for each repair.  The downside is shipping it back to them is not cheap, and you will be headphoneless for 2-3 weeks.  I think I will use the cheapest US mail to ship it back this time.I will use my PRO4AA while the R80 is in the shop.  The PRO4AA is heavier, but also much more durable, the parts are all aluminum.  Unfortunately, it does not sound as good and it pinches my ears quite a bit for long duration listening.",3
"I'm not an audiophile but i think these sound good. Mostly good bass response and block of the surrounding sounds.I have been using mine at work every day of the week. They are just as good as the day i bought them.  I have dropped them a few times but they don't seem to care.If these ever break i will buy another pair. Good value for the price.(Updated)I have now had these for a few months. (Using them right now as I type) I use them everyday at work, I drop them regularly, and they look and work as good as the day I bought them.",4
"Ugly as hell but they work well. I wouldn't wear them outside. I've been falling asleep with them on for maybe 8 days now and they haven't broken. Not uncomfortable to sleep with. Very light weight and feel good on my head and ward. Again, in case I wasn't clear.... they are really freaking ugly!",5
"I loved these headphones at first. Great Bass,sound quality was above standard for the price. But I cannot recommend this product to anyone because of the faulty construction. The plug-in bent almost right away distorting the sound almost the first week I got it. I didn't have an option at the time so I used them tell I found my earbuds. Then they broke again completely severing the right side of the headphones from the rest of it. Don't buy it. Oh yea, went on vacation forgot about the return policy time (my fault) then boom. I got stuck with broken headphones.",3
I have had the Koss UR -20 headphones for over a year.  I used them for studio recording and mixing. I use them with my headphone amp to make them sound better. The sound is balanced in these headphones.I do like the build quality of these headphones. I use these as my back up pair of headphones.  I recently upgraded to the TASCAM TH02.,5
"Really nice pair of headphones (replacing an older set of Koss's, destroyed by my cat) - robust bass, etc.  Ear coverage good,  rugged cord.  Looks like a decent pair that should last a long time (cat permitting).",5
"KOSS R80 REVIEWWhen my 30 year old high-end headphones died a few months ago, I went on the hunt for a replacement pair.In all things, my preference is to buy American made, or at least American designed and owned, so I looked first at Koss. Bose and several others qualify too.I have a bunch of very high end speakers and amplifiers rounding out at $8K for my primary system, so my ears are spoiled. See my review of AKG 702 headphones for listing of my test system and CDs. I bought the AKGs for best sound quality available for less than $1000Akg K702 Reference Class Open-Back HeadphoneMY REQUIREMENTS WERE:* Fits big noggin* Comfortable for hours of use* sounds great* less than $400* eliminates noise from dishwasher, vacuum and significant other when I am listening* For use at home in my favorite chair* No leakage so my daughter can sit next to me reading or doing her homeworkREQUIREMENTS TRANSLATED INTO FEATURES:* Over the ear cups that completely encase the ear* Adjustable headband that fits big heads, not giant* Sling configuration headbands are the best for long wearing comfort and rest on the head as opposed to clamping on the head and ears. If you move around a lot with headphones on, slings are not for you.* Closed cans, to isolate outside sounds. No leakage in or out* Long straight cable, preferably replaceableKOSS R80 REVIEWWhy R80:Same drivers as highly acclaimed Koss Porta Pro open headphones, replaceable cord, closed cans, US company made in Korea, adjustable headband, familiar name from the old days who made Audiophile quality headphones. Available straight or coiled cord.PROS* Semi sling adjustable headband* Closed cans and ear pad do eliminate leakage* Sound quality is good but not great, if the AKG 702s are a 99% of perfection, these are an 85-90%* Price, these are very affordable headphones that should last a long time* Build quality appears to be good, time is the best judge for reliability* The drivers should last forever* Replaceable ear pads and cordsCONS* Fit is good for medium and small noggins, a bit tight for my large noggin.* Closed cans and ear pads do not breath and can get very hot with a tight fit, it may be the material the ear pads are made of, possibly Koss could add some venting to the closed cans to alleviate the heat buildup*  Sound quality is good, not great; but for the price, 1 tenth of the AKGs, hard to argue with*  Sound stage is a bit narrow compared to AKG 702s and Audio Technica open and closed 700s, both 3x to 4x more money. Narrow sound stage may be a result of the closed can damping implementation and the materiel in the padsSUMMARYIn reading the other Koss reviews, if you are looking for stationary listening affordable Koss headphones, the UR40 open backs may be a very good option since they both breath and allow the drivers to move freely without damping concerns. Leakage would be a factor, but the sound stage should be bigger and heat gone.Koss UR40 Collapsible Over-Ear HeadphonesMy impression is that that from a design point of view the R80 was a good first effort by the Koss designers who should follow up by moving the R80 drivers and replaceable cord config to the R20 sling and bigger rounded ear pads configuration and offer the R80 in open and closed back cans like the AT 700. If the sling and ear pad materials on the R20 config can be significantly upgraded for a few bucks the designers should do it. Until Koss addresses the heat build up issue, they will always be at a significant disadvantage with an easily correctable problem. Koss should benchmark their Ur20, UR 40 and R80 vs the AT 700 for fit and comfort and continue to use their existing high-volume highly-acclaimed drivers.closed canClosed-back dynamic audiophile headphones, 53 mm drivers with neodymium magnet systems, 3.5 mm connector w/ 1/4"" adapteropen canAudio Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Audiophile Headphones with 53mm Drivers with Neodymium Magnet SystemsKoss needs to decide the target market customer for each product and clearly state the applications on their web site, commerce sites and packaging, otherwise one is left guessing what the Koss designers were thinking when they designed the unit.Simply buying the units to see what they sound like and how they fit is both expensive and time consuming. Head size recommendations would be giant plus on their web site. There must be several attractive people already working at Koss that could model their headphones on their web site with different views showing the connected equipment and applications, the cost to Koss for providing more and better photos would be $zero.  Alternatively, Koss could go all out and pay a professional photographer a few hundred for a photo shoot using Koss employees wearing the headphones and jacked into the target equipment like: i-pod, chair next to expensive stereo, next to sampling kiosk in store, sitting in an airplane pilots seat, ham radio etc.In the end, I gave the R80s to my 10 year old since her head is smaller than mine, the clamping is not as tight resulting in less heat buildup. For listening to her I-pod nano, Nintendo game and pc applications the headphones are perfect. They are her early Christmas gift. I had planned to use them with my PC but too tight and too hot, stereo and movie listening was a long shot based on the drivers that didn't work out.RECOMMENDATIONIf your head isn't big, and you are looking for some good-sounding inexpensive-headphones this might be the pair for you for all stationary applications including sitting at your work cube jacked in. Noise isolation is good. Cans don't fold and they are not echo-noise canceling so using them on the commuter train or airplane may not work. If you wear them walking around the neighborhood, make sure you have great insurance since you would be likely to walk in front of a car or truck.",3
"For this price they are very good. They are boomier than the Koss porta pro but they completely cover the ear.really well for watching movies or TV. Musically, they are fine just not as clean as the Porta-Pros.",5
"Sound is tin-like, little bass. I bought this for my nephew to use with his Christmas Kindle HD. I chose this due to reviews and because it seems durable for a child (which it really is). Very flexible, comfortable, really long cord. Sound sound is good for the price just don't expect something outstanding for the size. But for simple video games and movies/music that you don't plan on playing at ear bursting levels...this performs very well. I will easily recommend over cheap earbuds. Something to travel with that is comfy, sounds decent, won't break, and you won't cry over if lost/stolen.",3
"I use Bose when travelling for the noise cancellation, but I don't need to leave the Bose around so the cat can play with it at home.This is a great substitue.  The over-the-ear padding is comfy and seals external noise from getting in.  Perhaps not as neatly as a $300 pair of Bose, but eminently reasonable for hanging around home.  A great bargain to boot!  Thanks Koss - even your cheap ones are fabulous.",5
"These have huge ear cups, making them extraordinarily comfortable. The cord is much longer than most, giving you a lot of room to move around. For the price, nothing beats these. As a side note, I wear hearing aids, and even with those in, these are still roomy and comfortable.",5
I purchased these to use for emtal detecting but ended up useing them for gaming on my laptop in peace also. For the price they are great and I have been abuseing them to see if they can handle stress from heavy use. They have held up great and if they ever do fall I'll replace them with the same unit.,5
"I must say, these headphones are definitely unique. The drivers are huge, and so are the headphones themselves. These are insanely comfortable, lightweight, and easy to use.Audio quality is the major problem here. These sound very sub-par compared to other headphones in this price range. I would not recommend these whatsoever.If you are looking for headphones in this price range, I would go for the Monoprice 8323. Best headphones you can get under $50.",3
I have other high tend phones but I like Koss so I thought the price was right and bought them. I have to say these are way better than one would think. They live up to the Koss name all I can say. Oh they have a very open clear high end and the mids are full and strong. The bass is defined and not too strong not to over power the rest of the spectrum. The only thing I don't like is the cord is a little too thick and long for my taste.,5
"I bought these for my father who is temporarily bedridden. They are ideal for the rough treatment this entails-lots of cord tugging, pulling and crushing. They block out noise better than the open-ear style too.",4
I was expecting a decent bass but the R80 is quite lean in bass. Mids and treble are balanced to my ears but the lack of bass makes the R80 not suitable for listening to my music. Build quality is better than I thought though.,3
"The Koss UR-20 is a sensational set of headphones for such a modest price. The sound is rich, full, and clear. The bass is deep, the treble sparkles, and the noise-cancelling pads keep everything going in the right direction. You can really enjoy the music while those around you are going about their own affairs.Unlike so many lower-priced models, the volume is more than adequate. I'm using them right now, and I've had to turn the sound down three times since the music began. With other sets in the same price range, you can crank the sound up as far as it will go, and it's still barely audible. The Koss UR-20 really gets the job done.The headband is comfortable, and the weight is not outrageous. You're always aware that you have them on, but it's neither unpleasant nor distracting. The one downside is that over time (and I've had mine for years,) the pads shed a bit, tiny black particles of vinyl flaking off. Once they're completely gone, the cloth beneath still holds up well. It's actually more comfortable without the vinyl coating.I use these headphones every day, sometimes for hours at a time, and they are still going strong. I couldn't be more pleased.",5
I use these to monitor playback during recording sessions. They sound fine and are lightweight and comfortable. Three more words.,4
I like the rounded shape of these and the way they cover my ears are comfortable they fit nicely and are affordable.,5
"I got these because my noise-canceling phones (also Koss) died.  While they are repairing/replacing, I got these.  They are good for my stereo.  If, however, you use them in the PC and want outside noise blocked, they are not as good as the noise cancelling ones.",4
"If you bought the most expensive headphones you can, they would not be a lot better than these. The price was great. They got to my house five days before promised. Overall the sound quality, price, and speed of delivery were all reasons to come back to Amazon.",5
"I bought these as a replacement to the cheap headphones I received with my three tone detector, which lasted about 18 months of on and off use as I use ear buds in the summer heat. They are well made and have a substantial cord length which makes them ideal for setting the detector down and working away from the unit. Although I have gathered up the excess cable and zip tied it off on the shaft where it's out of the way. These are EXACTLY the same as what other retailers offer, but without the camouflage, for $30 less. Oh, and the size of the muffs really help keep your ears warm in chilly, windy weather. The only negative I can think of is that the cord is not made of a silicon rubber which doesn't get stiff in cold weather. If they did that, I'd give them 6 stars.",5
"I got these to muffle the bodily noises from the offices around mine. The headphones are well made and the sound is ok, but the fit is poor. They cover my entire ears, but they don't fit snugly against my head. They're loosest at the bottom of the earcups, at the bottom of my ears. A little adjustment of the width is possible, by bending the two wires seen at the top of the image, but it doesn't affect the tension, which is the issue.As such, now I have music, with just as much hacking and coughing and snorting and throat clearing and other mucousy sounds.",3
"Purchased these June 13, 2013. I was tired of my son breaking my expensive headphones and decided to try these as they looked industrial strength.  They do the job and didn't cost that much.  You will have to adjust the equalizer settings on your PC or whatever you use these for as they don't seem to be quite right with the neutral settings of most devices.  I like the wire on one side only, but I don't care for the constant adjusting that is required; they seem to reset to shorter way more easily when I set them down than when I try to lengthen them when putting them on.  I also don't care for the bulkiness; it would seem that they would be somewhat noise canceling just by the size, but no such luck.  For the money though, they work as well as could be expected.Update August 30, 2013: So much for durability; used them today and they broke. The size adjustment things on the head band broke.  I am careful with my usage of anything I buy and am very disappointed with only 2.5 months of use.  A close look at the adjustment fittings show that they are of low quality.  Definitely will never buy Koss again.",1
"I had some coby headphones around the same price as these, and I prefer thoes coby ones over these, sadly.....the coby ones I didnt have to tune my computers equalizer to make them sound right, these I do and I shouldnt have to. Unless this is user error, I dont think I need to tune my comp to sound right.....however on a plus for these, they are very comfortable to wear, and they are BIG headphones, also the bass is pretty, good. After all I guess you get what you pay for. I wish I didnt have to edit the sound, it sounds like im outside of a techno club listening through a wall, the sound doenst sound like im right there so to speak. I had to tune the 16khz up pretty much and the 1, 2, 4, and 8 up a bit, to make it sound right. The lower end just a touch for a tad more bass. Other then that theres my review 3 stars.",3
"These are very comfortable headphones.  I don't notice any ear fatigue at all. They are tuned for a little extra bass which some may not like, but this is one of the reasons I chose Koss.  Essentially they always have the &#34;loud&#34; turned on.  I don't turn the volume up very loud, but I still want to feel the kick drum and bass guitar when playing music.Additionally, the other frequencies are still heard.  Voices are easily heard.  For $15 these are excellent headphones.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the cord maintains the shape it was in from the box too long.  It doesn't forget that it was folded and that is easily forgiven considering the price paid.  They are big but I listen to these at home when the kids are asleep and I don't want to wake them.",4
"I've had mine for three years now, and I find the UR20s indispensible, since I live in an apartment and can't turn the TV up to a decent level otherwise. There's reasonable bass; you would expect so for the size of them. Always look at the specs. The low number is the bass, the high number (usually in the tens of thousands) is the treble. This set's bass is 30 Hertz. That's That's not a bad number; 20 is average, 12 would be phenomenal. The treble is set at 20,000 Hertz. Theoretically, only dogs can hear frequencies above that, but I think a headphone with a figure over that just seems to sound brighter in the treble, which is what I like. I hate unclear treble and muddy, distorted bass. Another number you look at is sensitivity; the better ones are always over 100. So, I guess based on the specs, these 'phones are about average.The cord length is excellent at 8 feet. I can be a reasonable distance away from the TV without straining the cord; I've even slept with them on without ear fatigue.These headphones make movie watching a whole new experience...you get surround sound without the expense!I've had a great experience with the UR20s and I recommend them for use with home theater, even if you just have a 20&quot; portable like mine. You need an adapter to plug them into a home stereo, and there's plenty of cord where you can be either reasonably mobile or you can sit in your favorite chair some distance away. I think they're great. The only thing that would make them the best is better specs, and that's hard to find at this price range.",4
"Given their price, these are pretty decent headphones, and worth the cash.My only two problems with it - first, they need to be resized every time you put them on, because they seem to suffer from &quot;pool shrinkage&quot; - they shrink to the smallest size once you take them off.And second is the one brought up fairly often - they don't do anything to block out outside noise. Which isn't that big a deal, as I didn't really need noise-blocking headphones anyway.",4
"For the money, these are excellent. I'm not very discriminating so can't comment on fidelity; I use these for my electric piano. They cover my ears well, provide clear sound and are comfortable for extended (one hour or so) wear. Also they're cool looking....",5
These are really good headphones I had the Cl-20 when I was locked up and these are the sameones but they just aren't clear. You can't beat this quality of this headphone for this price. I have bought alot of different pairs that cost more and they can't match koss. I love them and yes I would recommend!!!,5
I bought these for my daughter for Christmas.  They broke about 6 weeks ago.  Only one speaker works.  They were sent off to the landfill soon after.  I wouldn't buy them again.,1
"Bought these for my wife to use with her Kindle Fire. Good volume and tone, extremely comfortable ear cups and head band, blocks out background noise very well. You'd have to spend double or triple the cost to get a better sounding pair.The only change I'd make is a better adjustment mechanism. The present design &#34;locks&#34; into position when the cups are spreadapart, as soon as you take them off they're free to slide out of adjustment. My solution was to twist tie the top of the plastic yolks tothe two wire bars so there is always tension on the locking mechanism. A spring loaded &#34;T&#34; shaped bar could do the same and be adjustable for a small cost increase.",5
"this headphones are very comfortable, i would recomend to anyone that need a non-expensive headphones, i only use them with my PC, the only thing i didn't like was the bass i almost can hear itEstos audifonos son muy c&oacute;modos, tienen un buen volumen y buen aislamento de sonido, lo recomiendo a cualquiera que necesite unos audifonos no tan caros, yo solo los utilizo para mi computadora, me parece que son muy grandes para cargarlos siempre encima pero de todas formas ese era el uso que le queria dar, lo &uacute;nico malo es que le falta m&aacute;s bajo",4
"I read one review that said ""Koss Warranty a Joke""I am not sure how the warranty is these days, but it used to be great.I bought a pair of ""Sear's branded"" Koss headphones so many years ago I can't even remember what decade it was. When I bought mine, there was a one year warranty.After several years of hard use, the cord messed up, one of the ear pieces had broken loose, and a couple of wires had broken from the ear pieces. All of this was my fault. I couldn't bring myself to throw them away, so I stuck them in the closet.Several years later (probably 15 or more years), when Koss announced the change in their warranty, I sent these things in (at my cost - didn't cost but a couple of bucks) hoping they could be fixed.Within a few weeks, I got my headphones back in like new condition. Koss paid for the return shipping. My headphones have to be at least 30 years old now, and still going stong. :)",5
"These earphones are BIG!  Seriously, the picture does not prepare you for how large they are.  But, their large size helps to the be very comfortable.The sound is not as good as I was hoping.  Things tend to sound a little mushy through them to me.  But, for under $20, you won't find anything better.  Based on prior experience with Koss earphones, I'm expecting these to last a very long time.Their large size and lack of audio isolation makes them best for use in the home.  I use mine for computer games and watching movies on my laptop.",4
"I've had the Koss R10 headphones for more than 15 years and they finally need to be replaced.  I use them mainly to listen to movies through my audio system.  I'm not an audiophile, but I like the sound I get out of them.After only a year or so, the plastic frame that holds the ear cup cracked and broke.  I put some epoxy in it and kept using it because the speakers still sounded fine.  After a few more years, the ""leatherette"" padding started flaking and leaving little black specks on my ears.  Fast forward a few more years and the smooth coating had completely flaked off, leaving a comfortable, fuzzy fabric.  Koss should have used this fabric to start with.  I didn't have any more problems from them until the right speaker started cutting out a few days ago.  It's now time to use the lifetime warranty and get them replaced.  Oddly, it will cost almost the same to mail them in and pay the $9 processing fee as it will to simply buy a new pair from Amazon.",3
"I really do like these headphones.They sound pretty good.Are very comfortable.  This is rare for me as I have a big head.They have a very nice coiled long cord.The only negative is that they are ugly.but hell, they are inexpensive to :)",4
"As of 06/04/2014, Amazon's page on these R-80 headphones states ""Detachable, 8-foot, single entry coiled cord with 3.5 mm (1/8-inch) plug and 6.3 mm (1/4-inch) screw-on type adapter for flexibility and reliability"".  I can assure you that the item which Amazon just shipped me does not have a detachable cord.Amazon's description also suggests ""and 6.3 mm (1/4-inch) screw-on type adapter"" is included.  It is not in the product.  However, that is not a deal breaker; I have a few of these laying around.Sound quality is good, and the fit is good for my large head, and does a good job (but not excellent) of isolating outside noise.I'm still debating whether to return these to Amazon because of the cord not being detachable; it was one of the primary reasons I wanted to purchase this set of headphones.",2
"Got these for my wife. I have listend to them too. Great sound. Full range and bass. A lot better than the ear plugs. Also, cancels out a good bit of noise.",5
"These don't adjust small enough for me to wear.  I've bought lots of headphones over the years without issue - if you are a big person, these might be fine.",2
"I bought these headphones as a replacement for my Sennheiser HD202 (which I loved). The problem with my HD202's and many other headphones (I owned many) is that I would lose sound in one of the ears after a long period of time. (usually after 8-12 months) I found out that due to twisting wires (I would wrap my wire around the headphones after use) it could damage them and the special coating inside them.This is one of the reasons I love these headphones. There is a coiled wire, and it's only attached to one side. Very clever indeed Also, the wire isn't a ridiculous 6ft. long. The construction of them is plastic, so it doesn't feel the strongest. (My first pair arrived damaged and I had to get a replacement)Sound quality is usual. Nothing outstanding, but it's not terrible, believe me, it has quality sound. Just don't be expecting Bose quality.It fits my head nicely. For the price, I recommend these to anyone who wants some great headphones.",4
These are ok. Sound is ok . I'm not impressed at all but they work. My biggest complaint is they are lose on my head .. So they must be made for a giant head. Can't adjust them smaller.. They cover your whole ear but since they are loose can hear all the background noise so not good for a Dj..,3
"Positives: ComfortableNegatives: Sound floods in and out, and is of $8 walkman-era quality.Summary: I wanted to support an originally Milwaukee-based business, but these are in every way Chinese second-thoughts for the budget crowd. Spend more money for something with better isolation, sound, and construction.",3
"Right, you can spend a lot of money on head-phones, and not hear much more. These are well worth twice the price.",4
"I bought these as a birthday present for my father, and he couldn't be happier with them!  He loves to listen to music at a crazy volume, and these protect his ears while muffling the sound for those of us working near him.  Plus, the cord is long enough so that he doesn't have to sit right next to the stereo, and he can move without fear of the bit being ripped out.  Can't recommend these highly enough, especially for the price!",5
"It's a slightly snugger fit than I'd like, and my office is warm enough that I get warm with headphones on, but they sound good and feel good when on.Update:  After using them for a while and trying other headphones, these sounds pretty muddy.  Maybe they changed over time.  But for the price they're still a pretty good deal.",3
"I wasn't sure about these because of the price - I thought maybe fine for me or my teenager but I took a chance because I found a few good reviews.My husband is a bass player with a bad right ear who is super picky about his sound when listening to music.  Bought these for him for the computer....he LOVES them.  I tried them, too.You can't hear anything else (like the kids - YAY!!  - LOL)  but your music and the quality of the sound is excellent.  Are these as good as $200 headphones?  No, probably not (I can't afford to even try out a pair of those) but for the money I'd say you can't go wrong with these.My husband says anything made by Koss is great, and these prove it.",5
I like these headphones in that they do cover my ears and fit my (large) head.  Good sound and comfortable enough :)  They seem well enough made.,5
"You can only be careful when you buy something that looks good but it is too cheap, and these headphones do look great, they do feel comfy, they cover my entire ear, and the sound it is awesome, so yes I took the risk and I did right, these headphones for sure deliver great sound and the best part of it the price.. I totally recommend them, just keep in mind that if you have been using expensive equipment you might find these only to be ok, if all you want is to listen music, or just watch movies with these, they are great..",5
"The very best feature about this feature is that the ear cups are huge. I've seen some previous reviews complaining that they were too big, but I think they're terrific. I have big ears, so these are perfect for me.The only CON is that the headphones can easily adjust the sliders. When you pull the headset to fit your head, the sliders that change the head size will shrink.Overall: 9/10",5
"I recently purchased a pair of the Koss R80 and all I can say is they have a very nice clean sound and despite what people have said about build quality they seamed decently built for a pair of $34 dollar head phones. The problem is the cord was defective on both pairs I ordered (I had to replace the first pair), the right channel would cut in and out. I wish I could say that all the negative review it gets are unwarranted but I can't. I would avoid the Koss R-line of head phones and look else where.",2
I use headphones for TV viewing so as to not bother my wife.  These over the ear headphones fit excellent over the ear.  No pressure on my head.  Block out other sound excellent.,5
"I bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.  The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it ""should,"" but likewise, it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort.The cable is also thicker than most headphone cables I'm used to, which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such.I've compared the sound quality to the Koss QZ-50's (which I own) and a library's Koss UR-10's or 15's (can't remember which).  Though the QZ-50's do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on, the UR-20's are the most comfortable of the three, have the richest bass, are the most durable, and won't eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ-50's.",5
"Not the most expensive brand, top end noise cancelling headphones.  But these work great with Lumix and microphone in a crowd.  Cuts a lot of the ambient sound to make hearing dialogue easier in a crowded setting.",4
I use these headphones at home for casual use.  They are perfect for that situation.  They are very comfortable and the sound quality is good for this price.,5
"We were looking for a nice sturdy set of headphones that our 7 year old wouldn't break in a matter of minutes.  Not only do they sound great and block a large amount of ambient sound, the single cord on the left side is nice and thick.  We don't have to worry about the chair rolling over the cord.  The chair could probably roll over it a few dozen times with no fear of breaking.  For the price, this is a wonderful sturdy set of headphones.",5
good sound quality for such a low price. I like that the cable comes out of only the left side.,5
"These are great headphones for watching the tube and casual listening at home or work. They're comfortable and block out external noise really well. Lifetime warranty to boot! They sound good - smooth, flat  and full - but are not ""audiophile"" quality. You could do a lot worse for a lot more jing! Stick with Koss, they know ""cans!""",5
"This review is for the Koss UR-20 headphones. The sound is pretty good, but I personally feel like the Bass is lacking. It's ok I guess. I love the cord length. My previous headphones had a real short cord, so this cord is a WELCOME change (I think it's 8ft). I kinda wish that the cord came out of the right speaker, but that's just splittin' hairs. It's good at blocking out most outside sounds (when my mp3 player is turned all the way up), which is great, cause my house is like American Idol...People singing ALLLLL the time. It's SO annoying!! So I bought these specifically to block them out. For the price, I guess I can't expect much more. These headphones are pretty good.Some things I wanna add to this review. The cord is thick. I don't know how important that is, but there it is. These headphones are kinda annoying cause you have to readjust them every time you're about to listen to music.",4
I am 60 years old.  I have owned a lot of headphones.  Years ago you had to pay a lot to get a descent set. As the products got better you have ear buds that sound incredible and you can buy a cheap set of headphones for 6 dollars that sound really good but there overall range is limited and they are not very comfortable to wear.  I have owned Sennheiser wireless headphones that I paid 120 dollars for and I don't remember anything that sounds as good as these and are as comfortable to wear.  As far as I am concerned anybody who can't appreciate the quality of these headphones for 3 times the price is just being picky.  I would recommend these Koss UR-20 to anybody.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT DEAL!!!,5
"I have had these for several years and they have been subjected to steady use. I'm writing this review far, far in arrears.The sound quality is good. It's not a legitimate hi-fi listening experience but for general purposes they are good. The bass is not spectacular. It's present, but it's not what I'd call deep and rich. The treble is also good but not especially crisp. The sound quality is adequate. If you're accustomed to listening to hi-fi headphones, or a decent home system with a powered 10- or 12-inch sub, this doesn't hold up.I've had these for several years. They have been used for casual listening on the laptop, gaming, and to cover my ears while I'm mowing the lawn. So - a lot of sweat, a lot of wear and tear. They are pretty comfortable. This year the covering of the ear pads started to flake apart and peel off. There's a padded cloth beneath the plastic which is actually a lot more comfortable than the loose plastic cover, but it's going to get gross in a hurry if I keep using it for yard work / lawn mowing.Overall these are OK. OK sound, good durability. They are all plastic and pretty light, but hey, proof is in the pudding. These have lasted for years of heavy use. The drivers are still good. I've broken other pairs of headphones with no special abuse involved so this is pretty good durability. I can't say with certainty whether there are other offerings in the same price range with better durability or performance. Obviously, it would take years to do to another pair of headphones what I did to these, but overall, I'd say these are good. Not stellar. Not stellar sound. Not stellar durability. Pretty comfortable... maybe best-possible in that category. But they're not superior to a high-end pair of Sennheiser or Bose or Audio Technica headphones. They're just... good. If you want good, reliable headphones, good sound, good durability, for $40 or so, this is a good fit for you. If you expect lifelong durability or stellar, top-end audio quality and wonderful bass, this really won't do it for you.",4
"It was surprised at the build quality of these headphones.  Very rugged great bass and treble, and they fit over my big head quite comfortable.  You will not find a bitter headphone for the price.",5
"Sound quality is good, very little isolation though.  Very comfortable to wear.  Construction is very poor though.  Broke ear cups easily.  Would not buy again due to poor construction.",3
"First, the sound rocks.  I bought them for my teenage kids, but have swiped a pair since they block outside noise great and the sound is just awesome.However, they are huge.  I didn't think they would be that big and that is the one reason my daughter doesn't much care for them.  They are quite comfortable and don't seem to give me a headache like others do.  If the size (covers whole side of head) doesn't bother you, they are great. They could adjust a little more, as in the headband part could go a little taller and then they would be just perfect.",5
"$20 headphones, and they work great. I honestly believe that this is the best of what I can buy with the money. I like how durable it is.",5
"These are quality headphones. I use them around the house. They look funny with the knobs on top sticking out, but I don't care about looks. If I did I would have shelled out an extra 200 for some beats. Alas, if you want sound quality similar to Dr. Dre Beats without the ""cool"" look go for these!",5
"I bought these headphones for cheap. I got them shipped for 3-5 day shipping. I got them in 2 DAYS!!! And they were worth every penny! These R-10's are amazing.This is what I wanted for a pair of headphones:-Good bass-Comfortable fit-Not bulky (I hate headphones that pop out of my ears 4 inches)-Cheap but awesome.The R-10's fulfilled all of these. The only complaint I have is They're sound is a little muffled... But don't let that intimidate you! You get used to the sound quality in 2 hours of use. They are excellent and look very nice around your neck. Also a little tip! Wear them around your neck and turn up your audio. There! You can even use the headphones when they are not on your head! These are a wonderful buy on every level. And I should know, I am a music producer.",5
"These headphones are good for the price, but nowadays you can find better ones.Why are these some of the best in the $10-$15 price range?* Very good sound quality, especially in treble range* Sturdy, long cable with adapter* They don't break easily (though they're still made of cheap plastic)* They're extremely light (still, that reflects on their plastic construction)That much being said, they don't stand up too well to higher priced headphones. Here's why:* The bass/mid/treble balance is off; low midrange is a bit quiet* The seal on the headphones is not good at all, so you hear ambient noise and others hear your music playing* The flexible design does not always align itself properly* They require quite a  lot of power from portable devicesSo, there you have it. These are good headphones in their price range. However, if you're willing to pay a bit more (perhaps some $20-$30 on Sennheisers or Sonys), you'll get much better bass/mid/treble balance, better build quality (not necessarily better sound quality, though), and generally a better seal around your ears. Also, you're almost always going to get better bass with in-ear earbuds at this price rangeStill, if $15 is the max you're willing to pay, these should do the job pretty well. Just remember, these are not professional-quality headphones.",3
"I needed an inexpensive set of headphones.  Several manufacturers offer inexpensive headphones but I learned a long time ago that Koss makes the best headphones.  These headphones are built like a tank and will last a good long time.  I wasn't concerned with getting the best sound money could buy.  If I wanted better sound, I would have purchased a more expensive set of headphones.  For what I needed, these headphones are the best.",5
"These headphones are great. You can't find anything else that sounds this good in this price range. Koss does stereophones right!I have had my UR-20s for more than a year. They still sound great and have been stuffed into my backpack almost every day since i bought them. One of my size adjuster clips has broken, but it is no doubt due to my reckless use. Even broken, they fit comfortably on the head.The ear cups are big enough for anyone's ears. They cover your ear completely and do not &quot;crowd&quot; your ear like the smaller UR-29s do.The bass is amazing and the insulating ring makes such a close seal with your head that you will not hear anything while you have these headphones on. I don't like listening to music while I sleep, but I have used these headphones as noise reducers (without playing any music) on many occasions and bus rides.Note that these headphones are larger than most. This is probably why they sound so great. I especially like that the headband is made of rubber coated metal to keep the phones close to your head, with a cloth balancing strap below that to make it comfortable in any situation.Koss is the king as far as affordable, amazing stereophones go. Buy the UR-20s and you'll be glad you did. I have had no problems.",5
My girlfriend only had these for like two weeks and they just fell apart on her all of a sudden.,1
"I picked these up as a &#34;cheapie&#34; set to listen to music on my phone/tablet.  They're EXTREMELY comfortable, but just a tad lacking in the sound range.  I wouldn't recommend them as a primary set, but as a backup to go mobile with, they're not bad, if you don't mind the size.But I just can't say enough about the comfort.  They're awesome.  I guess I've got big ears, because most headphones mash them against my head.  I can put these on and they sit AROUND my ears, not against them.  Good and comfortable for long listening periods and while it the cups don't completely block out background sound, they do allow you to focus on what you're listening to fairly well in a noisy situation.For a sub-$20 set of phones?  I'm happy with them.",4
Yes for more money you can getm ore quality. But im the type of guy that goes for the best quality at the best price and these fit the bill. Produces nice clear sound and actually has some bass to it. the phones cover my ears entirly which is what i wanted since im using these in my bedroom to listen to tv while my girlfriend sleeps and theres normally fans or a air purfier on. Work great. I did use them on a plane ride and found that the small earbuds the plug your ear canal shut out way more engine noise. So in that case make sure the device you are using can out out some high volume or you may not be able to hear clearly.,5
"The title sums it up.  For whatever reason, I can't get these things to sit flat on my head.  The earpieces seem to fit snug at the top of my ear, then lift off my face at the bottom.  This prevents me from getting a good seal, so I get more background noise coming in.  Aside from that, the sound is good, and for the price they perform a lot better than I expected.",3
"I plug it in and put it on my ears.  The sound from the songs I play comes through.  It actually doesn't sit on my head right, but I think it's either because I have an oddly shaped head or because I stretch the cord out really far when I listen and it's like tugging on it a little bit.  Just a little.  Great sound though and they were cheap and arrived quickly.  I drop them a bunch too, so they're pretty sturdy.  Also they are the color of black which reminds me of space, which is cool.",5
"I am not an audiophile and use these phones for listening to SSB receivers. They fit nicely, sound good, and are comfortable. Excellent for the price.",5
"Nice headphones for the money. Superb bass response and clean sound free of interferrence from outside noise.The 8-foot cord is awkward because it is coiled and constantly tugs on the earcups. After more than 15 minutes of wear, cups tend to go sweaty inside. It would help to have an uncoiled cord as an option.",3
I'm writing a review on the Koss R-80. First off I had a pair of Koss UR20. These Koss R-80 off the bat feels the same in the material but it has a different design. The headband will stay in its adjusted form when if you take it off your head. It has a coiled cord which can be removed. The cord is connected like a phone card.Right when I put these headphones on I heard immediate sound difference. I use these on my computer through my Audiy 2zs. Very nice strong midbass and low bass. It hits the notes clean and clear. Never thought how great these would sound for the price. A very clean sound and strong bass. It's also very light. The only thing I dont like is the shape of the earpieces. The design needs to slim the headphones down a bit. For the price this is one nice headphone that will LAST. My Koss UR20 still work after 4-5 yrs of abuse. I just needed to replace them. Get this Koss R-80 and you will be glad. Super fast Amazon free shipping also!,4
for the price you will not find a better pair. sound quality is top a+ nice fit also what more can i say,5
&#8226; They cover your ears completely and a sit a little tight but comfortable&#8226; The sound quality is not bad at all for music and videos&#8226; Easy to adjust but no way to lock it&#8226;  The wire is long enough to put the computer on a table and watch videos without leaning forward,4
"Gave these as a stocking stuffer and well received. They were worn during workout, and were very comfortable as well as pretty decent sound...especially for the stocking stuffer price!",4
I use these with my MP3 player to listen mostly to audio books and podcasts.  They stay on and are comfortable with a good length for the cord.  Time will tell if they become my favorite headsets.,5
"I got a pair of these to replace the hphones that came w/ my MP3 player.  I was not expecting a super audio performance out of hphones, especilaly listening to a portable MP3 source.  However, the sound quality blew me away.  The bass response is tremendous, and there's absolutely no reason to increase the bass boost on the player.  It's an awesome little product.The only downside is the design - in trying to retrofit the Portapro to an updated ""behind the head"" fit, the Sportapros are a bit cumbersome to wear.  It's best to wear them in a traditional over the head fashion.",3
"These headphones work well if you want to listen to music but still be able to hear extraneous sounds (like the phone ringing, baby crying, etc.) without difficulty. The problem with them is that the wire is coated with a canvas-like material that, in my case, without extreme use, opened up in several places exposing the wires. Koss does have a lifetime warranty on the product, however it costs one third of the item's price plus shipping to send it back, and it will most likely have the same problem. Don't waste your money, get something else.",2
"For the price, heck, for 3 times the price, these sound great to me. If I were to rate these on sound alone I would put them in a class with $120 to $170 headphones. They have great bass, nice high highs and are clear and undistorted in most of the situations in which I use them. I could go on for pages about how much I like the sound and how they sound, to me, like much more expensive headphones. They are open style, which is not in vogue now with people who are discovering high fidelity headphones for use with a portable player, but they are very practical when you want to be able to hear your surroundings.The fit is good. But the headband is awkward. It consists of a pair of tightly curved metal bands that are bound by two plastic slide clips. You push the clips together to extend the bands apart from each other, thereby expanding the space between the earpieces. The system works and feels pretty durable to me, but it is clumsy. Or I am clumsy. Either way it is unusual. But when they are on, they stay in place, and for on-the-ear style headphones, they are quite comfortable to me. They are also very light as they are very thin, not padded (except on the earpieces) and small. These are actually really good on-ear headphones for someone who wants to jump in their headphones.I think their great advantage is their sound quality. They look and feel a little flimsy, but I think they aren't as flimsy as they look. But I don't think anyone is buying these for the look, unless they are doing it ironically. The quality of sound is the star here. I don't think they sound as good as $200 headphones, but that isn't bad, considering the fact they usually sell for around $24.For identical sound (as far as I am concerned) with a simpler and less expensive headband, I suggest the Koss KTXPRO1 at about $18. It is technically a different driver (titanium coated), but I cannot hear a difference and I find the headband easier to deal with.",4
"The headphones provide great sound throughout their sound range.  Even though they are not over ear headphones the bass is solid, and always there without downing out midrange or the high notes.  They can be worn for extended periods of time without fatigue, and your ears do not sweat.  I would strongly suggest incurring the additional expense for an in-line volume cotrol to watch movies.  Since your not next to your receiver it makes volume adjustments much easier.",5
"Good sound, would certainly buy another set...I just might soon, for back up. Excellent sound. I have some live recordings and sometimes find myself looking around for planes flying...but it's just in the recording! They might look kind of stupid, but they sound great and are very sturdy for work outs. good score!Jan 09 updatestill going strong. Use them for my workouts. Got that retro Starsky vibe.",4
"I love these headphones; they've got superb sound (particularly the bass region--I didn't know headphones were capable of this kind of bass!), they're very portable, inexpensive, and the accessories &amp; features it comes with are great.  They're also very comfortable (particularly because of the foam pads that secure the phones behind/above your ears), although I have a small head and I've heard that these phones don't fit so well on bigger heads.  I also like the way they look, and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonus.",5
"These headphones have teriffic sound regardless of their low price. I own a few pairs of quality headphones, including a pair of Etymotic er4p's. The Koss Sporta Pro 'phones sound great and the price is fantastic. The bass is incredible and the highs and mids are great as well. These 'phones are worth the price, and then some.",5
These things are fantastic for the price and portability. I bought them because I hate ear buds and wanted something with more oomph but without the clumsiness of wrap around headsets so I could walk and listen to music on my cell phone. Very nice bass and treble with a little loss on the mid range. I have always loved Koss and these are no exception. Recommended,4
"****These are my gym headphones****I am a firm believer in Koss quality sound, and these babies don't disappoint. They are basically the Porta Pro's but the &#34;gym/sport&#34; version. The lows frequency is strong, and the highs are adequate, the way I like it. Sometimes they can get a little bass heavy but it mainly depends on what your listening too. Since I am listening to mostly heavy music, I don't have to face the bass issue much, but can enjoy the great highs that come with the package.As far as comfort; using these in the gym when I first got them, was a bit of a hassle, mainly due to the fact that I was wearing them wrong. I watched a video on how exactly the headband actually clips backwards behind your neck and tightening the temple cushions to situate the headphones. From that point the comfort level was perfect for me to enjoy these headphones while I work out.The only issue I have with these headphones is the foam cushions start to feel uncomfortable during the end of my workouts. They start to get soggy and make my ears itch while I am trying to finish the last 30-45 of my workout. Other than that, I love wearing them in the gym.",4
"These have been, by far, the best headphones for running that I've come across. I've purchased several in-ear headphones, some designed for sports, and either the cord would transmit feedback when it would hit my body, or I was constantly fiddling with the buds staying in my ear canal. If you can get past the dork-factor of these Koss, they'll give you trouble-free runs. Also noteworthy, they sit on top of your ears, so you can still hear what is going on around you. I never really liked running with my ears in isolation from the rest of the world. Call it a safety factor, but I prefer to hear what is going on around me.",5
"I bought this headphones for my wife, and I have sennheiser HD580 for home and Koss KSC75 for portable. Compared to much more neutral HD580, bass is a little on the heavy side, and treble has a little more sparkle. But, these headphones are very enjoyable and quite detailed. The emphasis on the bass is largely due to the part of the headband where the drivers snap into. That round and concave surface right behind the divers amplifies the bass notes quite a bit. I took the drivers off the headband and put them into KSC75's ear clip (effectively making them KSC35) to see how the sound changes, and it confirmed my theory. Once off the headband, the sound signature became very similar to KSC75's with a little more bass and a little less sparkle in the high frequency range. Then I put KSC75 divers in sporta pro's headband, and well KSC75 became a bass monster. So by switching the dirvers back and forth, I can have for different headphones, sporta pro, KSC75, ""sporta75"" and KSC35, all for less than the price of KSC35 from Koss website. Money well spent!",4
"I wanted good headphones for my mp3 player and these fit the bill just fine for me.  They are the best I've found in the price range, and pretty comfortable too.  Some other reviewers found them unattractive, but I don't think they are that bad.  I'd rather have good sound and comfort than cute any day!  I like that they fold for storage, and come with their own little bag.  I am considering getting a hard shell case for them though, as the bag doesn't offer much protection.Nov. 2012 - I've had these little headphones for over 3 years now, and they are as good, or better, than when I bought them.  They are very well made, and I have since purchased 2 pair of PortaPro phones and a pair of Koss earbuds as well based on my love of these.  I haven't been disappointed yet. I have suggested these to several friends looking for good budget headphones, and have heard good things from them as well.  For the money you can't beat them.",4
"Extremely hapy with these. I was looking to replace the pricy Koss PortaPros, had tried the Koss KSC75 Portables but found them awkward and too fragile, as well as Koss&#8217;s &#8220;The Plug,&#8221; which yes&#8212;keep falling out of the ear. The SportPros are actually a mini-version PortaPros, same over-the head construction, fold-in ear pieces, leather case, and  plug adapter for half the price with the same great sound. Not to take anything away from the PortaPros, but  I can have two sets of these for the same price. They stay on your head, they stay on your ear, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about them falling out like the plugs or have to wrestle with the over-the-ear hooks of the  KSC75 Portables. Just an-all-around better headphone&#8212;nuf&#8217; said.",5
"I had a Koss KSC75 and it broke, so because I didn't want to pay $9 to ship it to Koss to get repaired (I bought it new for $10), I decided to get another version of Koss. A lot of people said this has the same drive as KSC75, so because I like to exercise and play sports and I really really like the sound of KSC75, I figured I want something that doesn't slip or fall out when I exercise and has similar sound to KSC75 (GREAT sound quality and HEAVY bass).Well when I got SportaPro the first time, I was kinda disappointed because it didn't have enough bass (I thought my KSC75 had more bass and even better sound). But after 2 months, I learned to like this headphones, and probably after it got &#34;burned&#34; for enough hours, the real sound came out and I admit that it also has deep bass. The sound quality is already good since the begining.The only thing is I don't know if this is waterproof/sweatproof or not, because I sweat a lot when I exercise, so I'm kinda afraid if it will ruin the headphone (it kinda defeats the purpose eh?).",4
"The SportaPro has a dirty little secret.The Sportaro literally uses the same exact drivers and housing as the KSC35, but instead of attaching the KSC35's clips, they attached the SportaPro headband. Here's my head-fi review 'snippet' of the KSC-35 which IS the same as the Sportapro:KSC-35, the more mature Koss clip-on that was discontinued and then brought back (only on the Koss website), for a pretty hefty $45. I'd say it's hefty because it honestly should cost just slightly above the KSC75 range, not 3x as much. They sound very similar to the KSC75. However, they are fuller sounding, with fuller bass approaching full-sized type bass, and the mids/vocals are very rich and forward. Treble is also quite neutral for me, not being too smooth, and not too sparkly. I actually am quite fond of their treble. The KSC75's treble is harsher, grainier, and more fatiguing. The mids on the KSC75 are slightly laid back, while the KSC35 presents them up front and more fleshed out. In all honesty, you can say the difference between the KSC75 and KSC35 is like the difference between the K701 and Q701. One is brighter, drier, and thinner sounding, while the other is more natural, and fleshed out.All in all, it's a solid sounding headphone, that does work very well. Bass was strong but quick due to the open nature of the headphones, but slower than the KSC75. Based on sound alone, I'd say the KSC35 is a headphone you could use for hours without fatigue. Kind of like a smaller, more bassy HD650. Nice tonal balance that I don't think anyone would dislike.The Koss Sportapro houses the same drivers as the KSC35, for less than half the price. You can literally buy the Sportapro, snap off the drivers, and snap the KSC75/35 clips on to the Sportapro drivers, and you have a cheaper KSC35. Ideal solution is getting the Sportapro and KSC75, putting the KSC75 clips onto the Sportapro drivers. This will save you $10, give you BOTH the KSC35 and KSC75 as a spare, and give the most comfort, IMHO. Just make sure to bend the KSC75 clips to place the drivers closer to the ears, as stock form may place the drivers too far, losing bass and overall sound quality.The more popular alternative, is to buy the cheap Parts express headphone (http://www.amazon.com/Mini-Stereo-Lightweight-Headphones-feet/dp/B0002KQZJS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1371458925&sr;=1-1&keywords;=parts+express+headphones), taking off the crappy drivers, and using the headband for the Koss drivers. I prefer the Koss clips rather than the Parts Express headband, but I'm in the minority.",5
"Pros: Fits well. Comfortable, not in ear.  Adjustability has advantages and I can wear a hat with them.Cons: Not good Koss quality sound.Sum: Good workout phones if you prefer not to stick anything in your ear. Recommend but only for niche that it fills.",4
"These Koss SportaPhones are great. (the name is a bit corny) Comfy on the head in the usual position and in the back of the head setting.They sound very clean, and very clean in the midrange, and have provide some surprising base notes.A great buy the $28.00!",4
"These are just about the best headphones you can get for ~$25.The entire sound range is great.  Great response, great bass, clear midrange.  Gives the original Sennheiser PX-100 (another excellent headphone) a run for its money at less than half the price.By the way - The drivers are identical to the famous Koss PortaPro Headphones.  Despite what some claim, the sound between the Sportapro and the Portapro is identical.  I've owned at least 3 pairs of each and there is no sound difference between the two.  Just buy whichever is cheaper.",5
"I know a lot of people have reviewed and liked this product.  Perhaps it works for them, but I hate it.  This set of headphones is already in the garbage.  Why?  The sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe it would be.  I have other headphones with much better sound, but that is not the primary reason that I dumped them.  The wire placement for the headphones is in an uncomfortable place - in front of the ear-coverings, so the wires are over my cheeks as they drop down to my ipod.  I would rather have the wires toward the back and out of the way.  Also, I like to drop the wires down the back of my shirt to get them out of the way and hook my ipod onto my belt.  The wires on these headphones are too short for this, and with the wire-placement, the wires cut across my neck when I tried wearing them this way.  I have purchased two Koss products.  I've been disappointed with both.  There will not be a third.",1
"The Koss Porta-Pro headphones (not Sporta-pro) have been my go-to headphones for more than 20 years now, so when I was ordering a new pair recently and saw the Sporta-pro I thought I'd give 'em a try for running.  While they almost have the detailed imaging of the Porta-Pros, they are 200% percent better in sound quality than my go-to running headphones, the Philips SHS5200/28.  I would give the Sporta-pro five stars, except that they aren't quite as comfortable as the Philips for extended wear. After an hour-long run, I felt that the Sporta-pros were pushing a little on the tops of my ears. The headband doesn't really feel secure the ""down"" position, so I've worn it up. Anyway, if Koss could take the ear pieces from the Sporta-pro and put them on a Philips type headband, they'd have an awesome sports headphone!!! hint, hint...",4
"I wasn't expecting much but these sound great!  I'm no audiophile but I am a speaker junkie and these sound good with jazz and rock.  And feel really comfortable on my head.  Not the coolest looking headset in the world but who cares.  I'm ripping the speakers out of this and installing them into a motorcycle helmet.  They play pretty loud with just my Note 3 aux out, btw.",5
"I have used an MP3 player with headphones for my workouts for several years now. I cannot use ear bud types because they just fall out when I move. I don't want to buy expensive over the ear headphones just to sweat all over them but quality inexpensive over the ear headphones seemed impossible to find. The Koss SportaPro is the best choice I have made yet at under 30 dollars. They sound great and the band style along with the pivoting ear pieces keeps them in place. The band pivots for the behind-the-head  or over-the-head style. I find the behind-the-head to be a little awkward, probably because I am not used to it, but they do stay in place, which is great for push-ups. I have read that some find them to be ugly but I could care less what they look like and frankly cannot understand that criticism. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone that needs headphones while exercising or any activity.",5
"On the plus side, these have great, rich sound.  They also grip the head well so they work for exercise.  On the negative side:  They are seriously fugly...like people will look at you funny ugly.  Also the 'strap' that goes around the back is NOT a strap.  It's steel.  The length is adjustable (though it can pull hair when you adjust), but it is rigid and doesn't really work in the ""around the back"" position (in the picture).  So I ended up wearing it in the ""over the top of the head"" position which worked fine but it's not what I wanted.  If you don't care how they look at all and you want seriously good sound, these are a good buy.  Otherwise I'd recommend you keep looking...I am...",3
"I tried this for the first time at work. Inmediatly bought one. They are lightweight, excelent of running, great bass.",5
"The Koss SportaPro Headphones are terrific.  They are Lightweight and can be worn over or behind your head as described.  These phones are fully adjustable for different head sizes.  The cord is 4 feet long. Sound quality is fabulous.  When you consider the low price, these headphones are a truly an amazing bargin.  You cannot go wrong with this one.  Highly recommended.",5
"I love Koss headhones.  I had a pair from long ago and they are not adjustable the way this pair is.  I ordered now pads for my earpieces on the old set and ordered this one because it sounded like maybe it would fit better when I wore a hat.  While they work as advertised and God knows the price is fantastic as well as the warranty, they just aren't as comfortable as I thought they would be.  When wearing them as behind the neck, the pads/speakers seem to slip around a bit.  I still like them, just wish my head was shaped a bit different to make them a bit more comfortable.",4
"Only on-the-ear headphone I have used.  Very comfortable. Highs and midrange are very nice however I expected more bass (may be an ear fit issue).  I  also expected a more compact fold-up. Otherwise, I am very happy with them.",4
"...with a name like ""SportaPro"" I assumed they'd be pretty good for, you know, sporty things, like jogging.When in behind-the-neck position, they tend to drift a bit. You have to get the band EXACTLY right, since that's the only thing holding them up - the band resting on your neck.Also, I'm not saying these things need a manual, but a small piece of paper with little arrows showing which way the things can fold on the headphones will be nice. They're a lot more adjustable than most headphones, but it's not immediately obvious.For the price, they sound really good. Despite the drift I've been using them for over a year and have no plans on switching.",4
"These admittedly dinky-looking headphones give surprisingly good sound.  Bass is full and the rest of the frequency spectrum is nothing to sneeze at.  Since statistically speaking you are like most people, you'll be plugging these into either an MP3 player full of badly-ripped, low-bitrate compressed audio tracks or else a crummy portable CD player with an extremely noisy potentiometer for a volume control.  Buying better than these perfectly respectable headphones would be a waste of money.The Sportapros fold up too, which makes them great for a coat pocket.  Also, the headband can fold in such a way that the headphones look like &quot;street-style&quot; headphones that are oh-so-popular these days.  This makes them clamp on your head a bit more, but it can't possibly be any less comfortable than any other headphones in such a configuration.  I think it looks stupid that way, but hey, if that's your cup of tea so be it.As for noise isolation, these don't offer much.  If you really don't want to hear the subway along with your gangsta rap, you should be looking at a pair of noise-cancelling phones or better yet in-ear headphones such as those made by Etymotics.  (The latter are a few times the price of the Sportapros on the bottom end, mind you.)It even comes with a fake leather bag that I keep laundry money in.  (Keeping a set of headphones this inexpensive in such a bag is just screaming &quot;I have OCD!&quot;) Bottom line, this is the best pair of portable headphones you can buy for the price.  They don't sound worse than the low-end Sennheisers in this price range, for example, and they are quite a bit smaller.",4
"I have been using SportaPros for over 10 years.  I have gone through 4 pairs (I'm pretty rough on them.)  The sound response is excellent for the price and they fit great (and tight) for when you're training/working out/etc.  Also, you don't look like one of these fools with huge DJ headphones on their heads.",5
"They stick to my head pretty well while working out at the gym. The foam is a bit coarse, so it's scratchy. I don't think I could wear them all afternoon at a football game, but the bass is excellent, great motivator when doing those situps during a 90 min workout. I would buy them again.",4
"For the money, these are the best headphones you can get. They have strong bass, are loud, and the sound quality is great. They are pretty sturdy, I have owned 3 pairs, and they have held up to gym use and throwing them in a backpack most of the time. The only thing I suggest is buying some extra pads, they tend to get sweaty and I like to change them out so they can dry properly. I have ripped one, but replacements are cheap. Don't waste money on more expensive headphones, buy these and enjoy them for years to come.",5
"I love these headphones in behind the head mode (especially now that I know the earpieces can rotate). In over-the-head mode I find the band a little tight. It works, but the earphones barely cover my ears. I have a large head, and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in over-the-head mode. But I'll likely be using it in behind the head mode even when I'm not outside wearing a hat, just because it's more comfortable.",4
"I am not an expert as much as the others posting here, all I know is that my original iPod earbuds were quite uncomfortable. I replaced them with this Sportapro and played Joni Mitchell's ""Hejira' on my iPod and it sounded STELLAR.Do be careful handling these as they seem less than rugged.",5
I bought these on sale and took a chance after reading some reviews on them.  They really sound great for their size.  My main headphones are a set of Grado SR-60 which sound amazing but these sound very close.The headband is adjustable. The fit is good if you use the band over your head.  The behind the head use seems to not fit too comfortably for me and when I put it on that way the bad ripped a hair out of my head.I use these with my 40GB Fourth Generation iPod. They have a lifetime warranty and I use my headphones for working out and go through a new pair every 6 months. Save your receipt!They can sound a little bassy but I like that in a work out headphone especially since iPods really lack good bass. Excellent for almost any kind of music except classical.,4
"I've always preferred behind the neck headphones and have been willing to sacrifice a little sound quality for smaller headphones. With these, there is no trade off. They sound great with excellent response and rich bass that isn't overbearing. They weigh almost nothing and are very comfortable on my somewhat oversized head.As for looks and styling.. they sound great!  Then again, if your headphone purchase is based on &#34;fashion&#34;, the help you desperately need won't be found in product reviews.",5
"I do like the sound, and the fold-up and tuck-away design is handy. I have trouble getting them positioned comfortably when I'm wearing glasses, though. It can be done, but it's troublesome. I think I'll get used to them. Yep, they're ugly, but we know that from the photo, and I didn't deduct stars for that.",4
"got the original portapros back in the early 80s and been using the successive variants ever since.  nothing beats these for performance vs. value.  I'm a picky listener (mostly classical) and have gone through way too much money buying stereo equipment of all types since the 1960s but these little headphones from Koss have been great ever since the type was introduced.  get some, you will be pleased.",5
"Koss does it again- I'll never purchase another brand's headphones, ever.  My last 5 have all been Koss and these have held up great.  I also got a set of PortaPros for casual wear.  Love Koss!",5
"These $20 headphones sound as good or better than many that cost much more. I also think they will be more durable. Only two downsides* They're not pretty* They don't really fit in the included caseStill, they're my favorite portable headphones.",4
these are possible some of the best knock around headphones i have had! if there is a contender for the Port-a-Pros it's the Sport -a - Pros!!!!!! these headphones are GREAT and very versatile!!!!,5
"I've been using these for years.  Excellent sound quality for the price -- far, far better than other portable headphones I've tried.  Excellent midrange and treble clarity, with pretty accurate bass.  A lot of cheap headphones in this price range have horrible, boomy bass.  Not these.  Sound quality degrades a bit at extremely high volume; if you want to listen to music THAT loudly, get earbuds instead.Can be worn with the band either over-the-top or flipped back in a wraparound configuration.  (This looks a little goofy, but does hold the headphones in place just fine.)  If you don't like the looks, the ""PortaPro"" model has the exact same drivers.The only real problem I've had is that after a while, the little foam pieces that help hold the headphones in place can tear off, and they're not easily replaceable.  KOSS has a lifetime warranty and will replace them under RMA, but it's a bit of a pain shipping them back.",5
"I wanted these phones because they are supposed to work as behind the head or on top of the head. Turned out that when used behind the head, they were a little uncomfortable, so I use them with the band on top. Not exactly what I expected, but they are OK and the sound is good.",4
"Very comfortable with good sounds high through low. They do cut out at anything 40 hz or below. So Hip Hop will be thin in the lower range. Jazz, Roxk, Classical, And more...they are very comgfortable and snug. Great for walking, beach with Tablet or Phone",5
"These sound very, very good.  Most ""mini"" headphones are lacking in either lows, mids or highs.  These have all frequency ranges covered.At first I could not figure out how they were supposed to work in behind-the-neck mode.  I tried it every which way, but they were always either awkward or loose.  I couldn't believe they promoted these as behind-the-neck headphones when they were so ill-fitting.But I did some googling, and discovered something that is not shown in the packaging or the enclosed manual:  The headband pivots.  So what you do is, put the headphones on the top of your head so that it's comfortable; hold the ear pieces in place on your ears; then push the headband toward the back of your head with your index fingers.This way the ear pieces fit exactly the way they do when the headband is on top of your head, except the headband goes around the back of your head instead of the top.  It's very comfortable and they fit securely.  (They're actually not behind-the-neck phones, they're behind-the-head phones.)This may be common knowledge, but I didn't see it in any of the reviews I read, though I did see complaints about how they don't work behind the neck.",5
"The Sportapros along with the KSC35's and the Portapros all use the same wonderful drivers.  You can expect very nice frequency response in an affordable comfortable form factor that does not stick into your ear like buds (no ear canal fitting issues and you are still able to hear what's going on around you depending on volume for safety).  I have all three of the models listed above and love them all.  The Sportapros are by far the value item of the three because they sell for 50% less for the same sound quality.  I've had the KSC35's and Portapros for years with no issues what so ever.Register your phones for the lifetime warranty!  The other day my little kid busted the ear clicp on the KSC35's.  I call Koss and explained I need to ""buy"" the ear clip part because my kid was rough housing the phones.  They said ""no we don't sell the parts... will will just ship them to you for free"".  The whole call took 3 minutes of my time.  The clip arrived three days later.",5
"I got a pair of portapros, KSC75s and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver. And to be fair, I was confused. Each headset has it's own distinct feature and advantage. Very frankly speaking, the portapro's price is what I believe Koss cashing in on the hype, since frankly speaking I do not see the 50% increase in any way.That being said, the portapros do sound the best of the lot, because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage. I guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers, hence kind of ""closing"" it up a bit. The KSC75 have it in them to sound as good as these two, but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out, hence the huge drop in bass. Press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you'll get what I mean.Comfortwise, I would say the KSC75s win by a mile. You won't even feel that you have a pair of earphones on. The pads are good, comfy, and the same for all the three, but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the KSC75s.Sportapros definitely look odd. The KSC75s look uglier. Love the design idea of the sportapro though, the conversion to a behind-the-head fit is genius, and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it. The portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch, in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in. the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3.5cm to 1/4"" adapter as well. Packaging wise, portapro is miles aahead of the rest (well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros!!). The KSC75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack, but then again it's almost 1/3rd the price of portas.The only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the KSC75s, which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it, make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection.But seriously kudos to Koss for making some of the best headphones I've heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on.",5
"Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance.  High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.",4
"These are great!  Many over the ear phones don't allow for much adjustment for head size, but these can accommodate a wider range than most.  In addition, each ear cup can swivel independently.  I've used them for many years now, primarily while running.  They fold up somewhat for storage.  I've owned several of them, and only once did one go bad--a wire going into the cups came loose.  Hours of sweat on the foam cups hasn't hurt them.  I can't speak about sound quality, because of all the noise I generate running and breathing gets in the way of fine discrimination.  They fit, they last, they are comfortable.",5
"Much sturdier than the porta pros, which I've had and used for a couple years. To me, the sound is exactly the same as the porta pros, but I admit I do not hear very well. That doesn't mean i can't tell the difference between a crappy pair of headphones and a good pair, but between the two pros there is no discernible difference to me in audio quality. These however look much nicer I think, and appear as though they will last a lot longer too. Of course they come with lifetime warranty, so when they break down (which my porta pros often did) just mail them to the company on the box with $6 and they'll send you a replacement pair pretty quickly.",5
"I have the PortaPro, which I bought when it was selling for $50. The sound is incredible for something in this price range, but I feel embarrassed using it in public, even though savvy audiophiles know it's cool. So I got the SportaPro. It's sounds as good. But it's not quite as embarrassing to wear.UPDATE:After nearly a month of use, I can say that not only am I pleased with the SportaPro, I favor it over the PortaPro. While the sound quality between the two is about equal, I find the SportaPro to be more comfortable, especially for wearing for a long duration. I've addressed the aesthetics, but I'll reiterate that I feel a bit embarrassed when I wear the PortaPro, in contrast to the SportaPro.",5
"I did lots of research before I purchased these headphones. Many of the reviews said the SportaPro offered great sound, deep bass, and wide range. Well, I have not been disappointed.Although I'm not an audio expert, I am impressed with the range of these headphones; the sound is as good or better than headphones costing $60 or more. They're pretty small, comfortable, and they're collapsible, so they're easy to carry when on the road.Some reviewers have remarked that they're ugly. I don't wear headphones to make a fashion statement, and frankly, although these aren't great looking, I don't think they're that bad either. Also, there's no longer a mute switch on these headphones. Apparently, they were causing problems (a short) so Koss removed this feature. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.",5
"*** UPDATE 1/21/11 ***  I've found that the design is not a problem at all with my workout.  I've change my rating to 5-star as the sound is absolutely terrific.  Compare very favorably if not better than my PortaPros and Sennheiser HD238's.I should have read the reviews more carefully and I would have seen that these are in face a double cord input and not single like I wanted.  The picture does not indicate this at all, nor is it specified in the description.  Dual may technically be better for sound than single, but for my purposes it is awkward.  I primarily use a rowing machine which means I place my player down on the floor next to me while using, then the rower has quite a bit of forward/back motion.  The dual cords hanging down in the middle make this very cumbersome, and the cord also winds up being too short, I will at least need an extender.I haven't played much with the fit, but it does seem that over-the-head is much more comfortable than trying to wear these behind the neck.  That's ok with me but I would have preferred the other.They seem to sound good, and for the price I haven't risked much, but had I known the design I would have kept looking.  I'll try these for awhile but I may not be able to use them for my purposes at all.",5
"Strait out of the packaging I hooked them up to my HDCD Denon player. Overall, they've got good highs and mids.  The 6khz treble region could be a little more pleasantly recessed than it is, but the high-end never gets  fatiguing at normal volumes - only when loud.  I must say that the bass is  a little exaggerated. It is noticeably overdone in the 30-80HZ region --  the lowest you can pretty much hear with headphones. This never *seems* to  muddle the mids, which is often a problem with bass-heavy phones. It  doesn't seem excessively boomy and there are oodles of low-end dynamics,  which I did not expect. They remind me a lot of the Denon 950's, but  without the Denon's tissy-fit highs. When I hooked them up to my Panasonic  361C portable, I was surprised even further. With Curve: Doppelganger, the  bass didn't seem even the slightest bit exaggerated. Unfortunately, when I  moved over to extreme low-end intensive music like Massive Attack:  Mezzanine, there was still a little too much bass, but slightly less than  on the Denon. Econoline Crush: The Devil You Know kind of had too much  bass, but most people would probably prefer it that way. Yet, on many CD's  bass is noticeably overdone.  Spatially, the SportaPros have a nice open  sound.The SportaPros fold up and this is where the other caveat comes  out. When using the headband behind your head, the little fold-up hook can  start rubbing against my head, behind my right ear. This only happens when  the band slides too far down, though. All Koss had to do was have the hook  facing the opposite direction to avoid this. They're still the most  comfortable headphones-that-press-on-the-ear that I've ever tried, and I do  love how they fold up; it returns them to a nice, taught shape. The Koss  has a good, short length of cord for portable use that also has a mute  button on it.I'll keep the SportaPros as a portable and bass-y  alternative. If used with bass turned down a tad, they would be even  better.P.S. Single-entry wires are not superior.  They allow out of  phase cross-talk to enter the opposite ear through the shared ground wire,  which is why audiophile headphones are almost always dual-entry.  The  classic Sony V6, for instance, has a cross-talk problem and is unsuitable  for binaural applications because of this.",4
"I like the Koss SportPro headphones.  They sound very good for this price range.  They are well made and comfortable. At this price, they are a great value.",5
"These are great for running or doing outdoor activities without being bulky. They sound great and are easy to wear and to store. I highly recommend for lightweight headphones, and they don't fall out of your ears like ear-buds always do. Good product!",5
"Worked and sounded pretty good for a few months, then the sound became distorted and every bit of bass was missing.  I am now shopping for a QUALITY replacement for them.-Very Disappointed in Koss",1
"This Product Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones, is excelent, sounds great and it,s very affordable for the price that I paid for it, I recommend it very much.",5
"I took a chance based on other reviews, and was not dissapointed.These provide great sound, especilly for the price.I may consider the closed ear type for noisy coditions, now that I know the sound is great.",5
"I use headphones for running outside (not treadmill).  I am a big fan of neckband headphones, (don't use ear buds) as I have used Sony's discontinued G57's and Philips discontinued headphones as well.  First, these are sold to be versatile to be worn as neckbands if you want but they are uncomfortable, and are NOT neckband replacements if that is what you truly want.  I wear them over my head, and when I put them on, the metal pinches my head when it adjusts for size.The reason I kept them was for the sound.  They are awesome.  They are more bass-y but great for outdoors.  even though they are bigger than most neckbands, they are still light weight.  If Koss would get these on a traditional neckband frame, I would give it five stars easy.  My old Sony's almost had as good sound, but the neckband and comfort (light weight and snug fit over ears) still make them my favorite compared to the Koss.",4
"We researched many head phones and decided on either Bose or Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones. While shopping on ebay we found a pair of Bose at a reasonable price. We purchased them, but even though we paid immediately, the seller chose not to ship the product. We did recover our money, but in the meantime thought we would give the SportaPro a try. I never did get to compare the Bose with the PortaPro, but these head phones give an awesome sound. Not being an audiophile I simply enjoy a great sound. They work well with a Lenova laptop without a sophisticated sound card, and the sound is much better than my Sony Rack system.When I use these headphones, the sound is very strong and all bass and treble notes are both clear and well balanced. Recommend these and the comparative price makes a good value. You don't really need to spend $200 when you can get a high quality unit like the Koss. Am buying some more of these for some Grand Kids.",5
"I have tried many other types of headphones, all more expensive, but no others come close as far as comfort and value for exercise or travel. Lifetime warranty on these also. Can't go wrong!",5
"I bought these phones based on the large number of very positive reviews here; I just received them, and am not disappointed.I got them to use with my Rio 500 MP3 player, which came with unuseable Koss earbuds (the foam coverings fell off every time you put it in your ear. They were also innefficient -- not loud enough).The Sportaphones sound excellent -- very smooth highs, efficient enough for good volume, and deep bass. My only complaint is a little overemphasis in the mid-bass, but this can be fixed with the Rio 500's EQ settings.The Sportaphones are pretty comfortable, although I can't see ever using them in the back-of-the-head position. The spring-type band forces them against your ears which will always help bass reproduction in phones. On the down side, this could cause fatigue after long periods.They fold up, quite ingeniously, to a very small package, and the leatherette bag plus gold connectors are nice extras. I don't know what the fuss is about their looks -- I don't think they are particularly ugly, and least on my head. I guess if you are ugly to begin with, the phones won't improve your looks! ;-)In conclusion, they are a great bargain for the price. I hope they hold up; maybe I'll get a spare pair just in case.",4
"Great portable headphones for the price. Well balanced sound, nice mix of treble and bass, not too much of either, just right.  Build quality is okay, I am not a fan of the metal headband, but overall they seem like they will last for a good while.",5
"I have bought 3 pairs of sporta pros during the last 3 years. (Nothing wrong with the quality, just I like to have one pair at home, one pair at office and another pair stuffed in my backpack)It looks fragile and sometimes ugly. But what really counts is the sound. The characteristics of the sound are: clean, warm, dynamic (overs a wide range from low to high), very good sensitivity (very loud at normal volume setting), lots of bass (although a little boomy at times). The first time when you hear it you will be surprise for its powerful bass. I hate the mute button but I heard recently Koss had taken it off. For protable use it's probably the best in its price class. Some people complain about the comfortability issue, I have no problem wearing it for hours though.For more serious listening, I would highly recommend a pair of Grado SR60 (open style). It's about $70 and I couldn't believe how much pleasure I had taken from listening to it. The highs are crystal clear, the bass is good but not boomy at all (you can feel it), the warm, open mid range is simply seductive. The transparency and spacious of the sound stage is amazing. It stirs up your feelings and emotions when listening to most vocal, classic and pop music. It's pity that Amazon.com doesn't carry this headphone, truely a gem in the protable headphone family.Another pair (closed style, around $70-80) I could recommend is Sony's MDR-V6. Good frequency range, very good bass, very clean sound and very little coloration of sound. However unlike the grado, the sound is flat although maybe more accurate. I will describe the sound as ""scientific"" comparing with grado's ""emotional"" and ""liveness"".",4
"These are by far the best headphones i have ever used. Agreed they look kinda awkward and arent marvelously comfortably if worn for extended periods of time, but the sounds completely makes up for all that. The bass is perfect.. great treble and mids.No complaint what so ever.",5
"I bought these from an affiliate seller as I live close to them here in NYC and I was able to save a few $$.  These are great headphones but if you are expecting to block out all other noise, forget it.  The way these are designed you are still able to hear what is going on around you which here in NYC is a good thing.  You still hear the music which comes through loud and clear.  I was hearing subtle notes and tones with these even through the surrounding street noise which I never did with my cheapo Colby headset which did a good job of blocking out noise when playing music.There is good tension on the metal headband but the way this is designed with foam rests make for a very comfortable fit.  I have worn these for a number of hours straight with glasses without any discomfort.This has a straight plug which I like as it does not interfere with the case for my iphone 3G.  When a call comes in I just unplug the headphone and move the speaker off of my ear.  I do not have to worry about breaking these as they are of a solid construction.  Even if they did break, Koss provides a LIFETIME warranty though the cost of shipping is about 25% of what I paid.  If these ever do break I may just buy a different pair but who knows.To sum up, these are probably the best bang for your buck for over the head phones.  They are not pretty though so if you are more concerned with looks than with good sound go buy something else.",5
"I bought these based on good reviews like above. The treble detail is good and the bass is solid and warm. Not tight and detailed based like from my Sennheiser 580's but those cans cost ~$200. Only issue I have with them is that the earpieces swivel on a small plastic joint that tends to get looser over time. Eventually, they start falling out a lot. Nice sounding phones but won't take huge amounts of abuse.",5
"I loved these headphones from the very first day. I can't say I ever really needed to use the band behind the head trick, but for the sonic quality they deliver, the warranty they offer, the flexibility to switch the headband position, and the price you pay for the deal, these deserve 6 stars!I own these since around 2000-2001 and I just recently started hearing some rattling in the right ear channel. No problem - sent them out to be repaired by KOSS, for a marginal cost of shipping they were returned to me with new membranes, a new cord, and new cushions, plus a thank you note!These beat a lot of other headphones I've owned.Plenty of kickin bass and pure crystal clear highs. good mids too.A word of caution: the headband is not for giant heads, but should fit just fine for most.Recommended.",5
"I purchased the Koss Sportapro headphones to use with my IPod Nano.  I was surprised with the overall sound quality.  The sound responsiveness is very good.  The main reason I did not rate them a 5 is they are not quite as comfortable as I would like.  I use them while I exercise, and I find that I have to adjust them for comfort long before I am done.",4
Excellent sound quality. Fits well over the head or from behind. Lifetime warranty also.,5
"Koss is still making great products.  I have been buying Koss for over 30 years, and I have no complaints.  Got these for my college son.  He says they work great. They go on top of the ear, which my son likes that better than the ear inserts.  They fold up into a neat little case.",5
"The SOUND: better than many portables, but a bit bassy with a corresponding loss of treble. Still not the perfect phone, especially when I am used to the full-size Sony closed-ear MDR-V6/MDR-7506, which emphasize the treble slightly while having the full sound you get from a good headphone. My Sony's are also more efficient--they're louder. PS, I wish I could find the cans that came with aiwa portable tape players a few years ago. They were great, and you could hear the cymbals dancing clearly.The LOOK: somewhat ugly plastic form.The HEADBAND: can be bent down to go behind your head to keep your gel in style. Still stays on. I liked the Sonys for this and their great look, but their sound was atrocious and they were less comfortable.The PRESSURE: the extra pads just above your ears take most of the pressure holding them on your head, so they stay on and don't press your ears too much.The BUTTON: yes, it has a mute button on the cord, but it's too low, at the waistband if you're 5'-6"" and sitting in your chair, and when you cross your arms the music cuts out.The PLUG: has a quick-connect regular and mini combo plug.The BAG: You get a leatherette bag to put them in.The SIZE: They close up flat into a 6"" x 4"" area for storage.",4
"I did not expect much. I thoight to myself, what should I expect for less then $25 a pair. Oh my God, with the correct persoonal ajustments to your MP3 player, the sound is NO LESS THEN AWESOME. THE SOUND IS CLEAR  AS A BEEL RIGHT ACCROSS THE SPECTRUM. If you are not careful, the bass wil completely blow you away. I have ear phones that cost upwards of $300 + and they do not come close. They are comfortable and stay on your head at the gym not matter what part of the circut you are on. Buy them and then buy some more!!! I am not kidding After I finish wring this review, I am going to order two more pair. Oh yes, buy the extra foam ear-pieces.",5
"I bought this unit from amazon over ayear ago and the reason was I felt the price was good and with al the tapes I make I wanted some control over the sound quality.  The unit is okay but has some klitches.  Currently I am running my MD player/recorder and my dual cassett deck through this unit to my receiver.  It allows me to do this because it will acommodate two tape decks as well, I might add, tv or audio visual.  These are important features if you are using last years model receiver with no MD input. You can really impact ont eh bass midrange and the high notes with this unit it has the goods what is difficault is that the buttons stick and as a consequence you have to manipulate them to make sure they are all the way in or all the way out.  Before I figured this out I thouhgt the unit was broke and put it in the garbage.  I couldn't just pitch and it is a good thing because when I got an MD recorder and realized I needed a way to attach it to my stereo I started playing around with the unit and discovered the stiky button problem.  Now I am just recording away and am pleased.  Like anything in this life there are ups and down points.  If you have some patience and want great bass or more difined midrange or aweet highs even playing with annoying buttons makes this unit worth the price",3
"If you are looking for some eye candy with your music or audio, then I recommend this EQ/Meter. It is really alot of fun to watch your music and/or movies come to life. It is definitely a conversation starter.That said, the audio input and output to analog only. Therefore if you have digital audio, you need to get a converter.Overall, a fun purchase if you are looking for a light show.",4
"I just received my unit - purchased directly from the manufacturer at a better price than Amazon.  I was a bit apprehensive based on all the reviews that I've read on Amazon but I also didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on my Pioneer stereo (circa 1985).It was easy to setup and connected my CD and turntable within minutes.  I was puzzled the lack of sound from my turn table but thankfully I had an turn table amp that I purchased from Amazon (see that review) a few years back, connected it and records play wonderfully.I do not have issues that others have reported, like I said, it sounds great and it was easy to setup.  I would say this is a great buy.",4
"It looks a bit more expensive than just a cheap analog 10-Band Stereo Graphic Equalizer. No audiophile quality here, just an easy EQ solution for your power amp.",4
"I decided to get the AudioSource EQ 10-Band Stereo Graphic Equalizer in spite of the many reviews expressing dislikes from unhappy customers. I wanted one, especially after my old Technics graphic equalizer had given up the ghost!The sound was ok, but it just wasn't sounding like it did before the old equalizer died!With this new unit, it helps give the sound coming from your headphones and speakers that extra kick which also give a tremendous boost to the bass & highs!! The dazzling Spectrum Analyzer Display give the appearance of dancing Christmas lights!  You can just sit and watch the display lights dance across the whole spectrum as you listen to your favorite kind of music!My old Technics unit was good, but it didn't have the display. Just the buttons that light up in red. There are buttons near the bottom on the front panel for power, Tape 2 & 2, Audio/Video, EQ Bypass, EQ Record and Line/Tape. Two small knobs for adjusting the sound level for left & right channels.When the unit is turned on, the power button lights up in green. In the off position, it lights up in red and stays that way until it is pressed again to turn the unit back on.Getting it hooked up was like the major obstacle course! At first there was no audio for about 3 or 4 tries. Then I thought about sending it back until I hooked up the audio cables, and then, the audio worked perfectly!!All in all, I think that it's a great addition to anyone's stereo system!! I just hope that no problems develop with it.~Daquan13.",5
"This equiptment does require a solid speaker/amp set up.  This will give you the capability to blow out cheaper speakers due to a lack of internal limiting circuitry.  Not a complaint at all though.The range on this thing is very good, also allows you to EQ recordings you make to CD, Tape or MP3 if desired.  Made the music sound much bigger and sharper.  Especially feeling my CD's were flat in sonic output.  If not desired, the bypass button will stop this effect with a single touch.Mine was built a year or so ago, sat around in it's box and yes, got ""sticky"" before it was sold.  I quickly resolved this by blowing dust with aerosol out while pushing the buttons in and out.  Not a problem since.Smooth operation that doesn't impart a ""click"" onto your recorded media when reproducing and fine tuning things live.  Plated plugs and a turntable ground wire in the rear all plusses aswell.  Quite pleased, gonna buy another.",5
"This product does not work. I purchased this product to replace a Faulting ADC 215 Equalizer. This was the only choice on the market. After getting the unit I was able to connect it quite simple in to my system. I have a DBX unit for my Reel To Reel and had to connect it directly to the Reel To Reel, not much of a problem. But then the problem started to unfold. First the buttons, They are confusing, and don't work half the time. Then I noticed that I could not monitor tape recording output from Three head Deck and DBX record monitoring. With the EQ connected to a deck that monitors it seem to short the input to the output, causing the input level control not to respond, not distortion but not good for you tape deck. After that I started tested a different configurations. I have a 2 Head deck, So I connected it to the EQ 200 and it worked okay, but still had problems with the buttons happened again. I then connected the Reel to Reel without DBX, direct bypass the monitor loop and it worked okay for the first few times, then all of a sudden I could not record on the Reel To Reel, the input controls didnot work and the signal to the meters were pegged, not good, then I losted the 2 head deck. Powered off everything and tried again. After several reset everything worked again. So I decided to give this unit one more try, by adding one piece at a time and testing one piece one piece at a time. I added the Three Head Deck (Teac V711), to Tape1, then tested, worked okay for a while and then things started not working. Remember this is just 1 TAPE DECK !!!!!! connected. Powered off all components and things went back to working. I said okay maybe it is me let me read the manual more closely. Figured out the button (Tape 1>2/Tape2&lt;1) button depends on the setting of the (Audio/Video) button and also the (Line/Tape) button so to listen to Tape Deck 1 you must have Tape1>2 + Audio/Video + Line/Tape LED Green. Okay that worked, only for about and hour and then same problem happen, input controls stop working and meter pegged and again this is just 1 TAPE DECK CONNECTED !!!!!.What I have found out after opening the unit and putting it on a Oscilloscope, I found that the contacts in the switches are very poorly made and are solider to close together and are causing electrical interference. When a button is depressed and testing the contacts on the Oscilloscope showed a little ambient noise -75dbm level, which is okay, but as you use the switch the noise level increases until it shorts, that is why when you power off and let the unit sit and power back on it works okay that is kind of a electrical discharge so to speak and the ambient noise is back to around -70 ~ -75dbm. The open circuit test fluctuated from inf to 10K ohm resistance. Closed circuit test revealed from 0 ~ 1 ohm resistance on average but fluctuated to inf at times. That why the sound cuts out and the input shorts to the output.So all in all the unit went back for a refund. Please don't buy this unit. It is low quality and poor craftsmanship that it will not last more than a month or so. It does not support tape monitoring, and don't try to connect a Three Head Deck it will short out your Deck. The buttons don't work and short constantly. Tape to Tape dubbing is limited to only monitoring source, THAT IS CORRECT, when dubbing you can only list to the source Tape and not the dubbing tape to insure that the deck is recording okay. This is a very poor design!!!",1
"Buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days, but I still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again.Used to have one years ago...now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer.The equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer.It allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer.",4
"I read another review on here complaining about the ""sticky buttons"" on the Audio Source EQ 200. After reading another review saying their unit worked fine with no button problems, I decided to take a chance, hoping that the other reviewer's button problem was an isolated incident. Wishful thinking. I've had the EQ 200 for about a week and the same problem showed up on mine. I was listening to an old album on my turntable when one of the stereo channels just cut out. At first I thought it might be a loose cable, or worse, a problem with the cartridge on my turntable. Then I remembered the review about the ""sticky buttons."" Sure enough, I went to the EQ and jiggled the buttons, and the sound cut in and out as I did so. After jiggling them a few times the problem went away for a while, then it out of nowhere started acting up again. It's not so much that they ""stick,"" as it is that they just plain don't work properly. The have a ""cheap"" feel to them; all the switches appear to be mounted to a single flimsy bracket. When you press one switch you can see the adjacent ones move. Besides the fact they don't work, they are confusing and limited the way they are formatted. They don't let you monitor the tape deck's output when recording; something that should be a standard feature of an EQ. The buttons on my old Radio Shack/Optimus EQ made a lot more sense in how they operated for dubbing/monitoring. There are a couple other annoyances on the Audio Source, too. The analyzer display has no sensitivity adjustment; when I play my CD player, the display is just maxed out. You can adjust the display by turning down the input level knobs, but I only want to turn down the display, NOT the volume! The ""0"" line on the EQ should be a different color for easily identifying the relative position of the sliders, but it is simply white like all the lines, which makes it difficult to easily identify the center line. If I were keeping the unit, I would take care of this problem with a magic marker. There are also no scale markings on the input level control knobs, leaving you to guess as to when you have the left and right balanced. The sound quality seems decent when it works, but what good is a stereo component if the sound cuts out while you're listening to your music? The illuminated sliders and spectrum analyzer look neat, but hey, I don't buy a stereo component just for looks. Seeing as other people have complained of the same button issue, I'm sure Audio Source has to be aware of the problem. Obviously, they are not going to invest the resources to correct the problem on something as obsolete as a graphic equalizer. It's too bad, since this model seems to be pretty much the only EQ left on the market for a home stereo. The only other EQ I found other than professional models for rack-mount systems, was a TEAC model which doesn't have as many inputs as the Audio Source. I am returning the Audio Source for a full refund; no sense having them send me another one when undoubtedly it will have the same defect. I guess I will try my luck with the TEAC, either that or put up with the muddy sound my stereo has without an EQ. I will just have to do the old cable swapping routine if I want to do any dubbing with the TEAC.",1
"Had this and now have an ART 341 EQ for $99.  No comparison!  ART is actually DJ/real quality with unbalanced RCA jacks for home use as well as the balanced jacks for pro use.Ultra-quiet, high quality potentiometers, discrete 2-channels with output control, clipping indicators, 6 or 12 db scale select for each channel.  Ground lift select for possible source grounding problems.Just need to buy 4 rubber adhesive feet for home shelf mounting, rather than rack mounting.  Comes without feet and rack ears for 19"" rack.  Much nicer EQ than this Audio Source junk, and I've owned both.",1
"What an AWESOME camera -- I can't say enough good about this camera.  It is so user friendly that we purchased it for my 70+ year old parents for Christmas, and they are already using it to sell things at online auction  sites.  Resolution is EXCELLENT, ease of use is exceptional, and you cannot  beat the convenience of just popping a disk into your computer and pulling  up the images -- WHY would anyone waste their time (and more importantly  their money) on those digital cameras with dumb &quot;smart cards&quot;  that require cabling into your computer and all kinds of fancy software.  The Sony comes with respectable software, but I HIGHLY recommend purchasing  PICTURE IT software -- it is ideal for use with this camera.  If I had one  criticism it would be about storage space - the floppies don't hold as many  pictures as I'd like, but it's really not a big issue unless you're going  out somewhere with the intention of taking a lot of pictures and plowing  through them later (in which case you just need to take some spare floppies  with you).  Truly a camera you will buy and be enjoying immediately.",5
"yep, it's big and heavy. but this is the camera i keep coming back to after having it 6 years...i have owned an HP and a Casio. the HP stunk and the Casio is a tiny delight. but the Sony was my first.it simply works. well. simply. competently. not every computer around has card slots and having a camera that uses floppy disks has been helpful.it is especially good for pictures for eBay and email. good quality photos with a small file size.so, if you see a good looking, working specimen go ahead and buy it and give digital photography a try!",5
"This camera has a lot going for it.  The first picture I took turned out great!  The camera is very user friendly which is good because the manual that Sony provides is not very well organized or well written.I find  the floppy disk storage to be easy and convenient. The camera allows you to  make a copy of the disk right in the camera so you can share copies of  photos with friends on the spot.The Mpeg movies are a fun little add  on.  I am taking the camera to England in April and I think it will be fun  to capture little movie clips over there.The rechargeable battery seems  to be adequate. I am planning to purchase the more powerful one that  provides longer charge.The video and audio cables provided allow easy  viewing of the photos on the TV set.The only  negatives with the camera  are the difficulty holding the view steady when the zoom is on (but no  other digital camera maker provides a zoom this powerful)  Also, the light  that leaks out of the window at the top of the LCD screen.  This can be  annoying in a dark room.Overall, this camera delivered the features  that I was looking for.",5
"I cannot tell you how wonderful this camera is!  You have to have one!  It will change your life in so many ways--the photos are wonderful with great resolution, movies are exquisitely wonderful!  The sound is just fine.  I love using the diskettes.  The lithium battery is great also--lasts a long,  long time prior to recharge!  All problems of older digital cameras have  been solved with this lovely piece of technological work...",5
"After carefully studying the features, using them inside thestore, and viewing the pictures on one of their display PCs I washappiest with the high resolution photos that the FD-88 produced as well as it's special effect's capability. I also appreciated the lack of legacy adapters and wires. Its use of standard 3.5 floppies is great. You'll be hard pressed to find a computer without a floppy disk now or in the future.I worked up the courage to buy it, I've been using it for several months now, and I have NO regrets. A couple friends have some of the newer Kodak, AGFA, and Olympus models and they're all disappointed with theirs compared to the FD-88. The disk writes pretty fast and you can get usually 10 or 12 highest quality photos per disk.  Movie resolution is good for PC and Web use, but, its 15 sec or 60 sec recording limit can be a little limiting.  END",5
"I bought this camera before leaving for a long stay in Japan, where I did lots of backpacking, hiking, and traveling by train or hitchhiking.  I liked the light body - it was easy to carry around and didn't weigh down my bag much at all.  Naturally the camera got banged around quite a bit, and I even dropped it in its bag a few times.  However, even though it was abused enough for the filter to crack, and I had to re-align the view mirrors when I returned, the camera kept working with absolutely no problems, through all of the 600 photographs I took.The pictures quality was excellent.  I didn't have problems with graininess, and I'd guess that the reviewers used 800 film.  Automatic focus was plenty fast.  Actually, I ended up being lazy and using the automatic features most of the time, but with few exceptions, the results were about what I'd expect.  If I had to do it again, I'd get a lens with more zoom, but that's more personal preference than anything - the included lens worked fine.I strongly recommend using a non-obtrusive filter, to protect the lens from scratches and damage.",5
"I have had such a great time learning to use this camera and taking photos. I used it immediately, switching the dial to automatic and letting it do everything. It was exactly like a point and shoot. But when I learned how to adjust aperture and shutter speed, I took even better photos. I highly recommend this camera. I took it to Alaska in August and people said how beautiful and crisp my photos were. If you have the money, also invest in a telefoto lens. Sometimes 80mm just isn't long enough. But you can always add that later.",5
"Great Camera, great condition LIKE NEW. It takes amazing photographs and is easy to handle and work with. The price was very low considering the great quality photos I can take with it. I couldn't be happier and I take it everywhere. The only disadvantage I can find is that the battery that this camera needs to work is very hard to find, and maybe the seller should have specified it with the information regarding the camera. It works with 2  CR2 2 V Batteries.",5
"Had I waited, this would have been the one.  I have the Rebel G, and it has been a great camera.  Having worked in larger, non-automatic formats, I really felt kind of like a &quot;cheater&quot; when I got my new Rebel.  One roll of film was all it took to make a convert of me.  I have rarely been disappointed with my photos.  In fact, the only time I have been, I was really stretching my photographic wings, and had I read the manual more carefully, would not have been disappointed had I followed the directions.My sister-in-law bought the Rebel 2000 this spring, and I didn't think they could improve much on the one I have, but they did.  Trying to focus on confusing images, such as framing wildlife with nearby foliage, can be challenging. The 7 point automatic focusing is a real plus in this respect.  I have learned to work without it, but the advantage of the system allows for quicker capture of images without the need to compose and then re-adjust to the frame you want.Because the camera is so well-made, I will probably not need to replace it for another 20 years.  But---if it should somehow meet with an early demise, the improvements in the new Rebel 2000 would be very welcome!",5
"The Canon Rebel EOS 2000 is really one of the best buys in 35mm film cameras. The autofocus 28-80 lens works for all but the longest shots, and telephoto lenses are readily available. It's user friendly and takes fantastic photos for the price. It would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality. I've owned Nikon cameras all of my life(and still do) and love them, but Nikon doesn't really have a comparable camera to the EOS in this price range. This camera is comparable to the old AE1 Program(a great camera also), but with more features and even easier to use. A lot of &quot;Bang For The Buck&quot;!",5
"This camera is a quality product and takes excellent pictures, especially in outdoor lighting.  However, at the cost, I can't give it an exceptional rating.I use this camera to take action sports photos.  If you're close to the action, the camera does a good job.  But, $400 seems so expensive to me, even if that is what the market will bear.",3
"This camera is very similar in features to the Minolta STSI, in about the same price range, but I was still impressed enough with it to make a few comments. One thing the STSI offers that the Canon doesn't is predictive autofocus. This can be quite useful when doing action shots. It also offers a panorama mode, which the Canon doesn't offer. I've enjoyed using this mode quite a bit on my little Fuji Tiara APS camera. Both cameras have similar F ratios for the lens and both have 1/2000th of a sec top shutter speeds. Two things the Canon offers that are nice are the 7 selectable autofocus points, which some advanced users might find useful, and depth-of-field preview. Even the Elan II doesn't offer the latter capability. One last thing to be aware of is that the Minolta camera will usually be offered with a 3rd party lens. If you want a Minolta lens you'll need to pay quite a bit more for it. However, the Canon comes with a Canon lens but doesn't cost any more. All in all, this is a pretty feature-packed camera at an attractive price, which should serve the needs of the vast majority of photo buffs.",5
"So much better than the Rebel X!  It it lightweight, takes fabulous pictures, and looks good to boot!  Having used my mom's Rebel X for years, I finally bought the 2000 in September of 2002.  I love the fact of having it!  In the bag, it doesn't break my shoulders like the X did, and takes beautiful photos.  I am into SLR, however, my first digital will be a Minolta DiMage 7i (non-SLR).  I *will* be keeping this one, though, for the long distance shots with the other lense I have for it and teleconverter.  Worth having for anybody!",5
"I bought my wife one of these to replace her aging Pentax K1000. She is very happy with the features and the light weight, as well as its ease of operation...you can run it as a point-and-shoot camera, fully manual, or any of a number of modes in between. The only negative to this camera is the standard 28-80 lens, but if you are a casual photographer you won't mind its mediocure optical performance. Remember, this is a relatively inexpensive camera and it has a lot of features for the money. If you want to spend more on the lens, get the excellent Canon 28-105 lens, or for more flexability get one of the third party 28-300 lenses (which aren't great optically but again are a great value).I own a Canon Elan IIe, which is a better camera in some ways but I would certainly recommend the Rebel 2000 to anyone wanting a superior point and shoot, a photography student, or a traveller needing light weight and do-it all capability, or even as a second body for someone with another Canon camera (I'm thinking about this myself).",5
"My child is a black and white photographer, this unit was a great gift to produce black and white pictures.",4
"But the fact is, I use the automatic setting 99.9% of the time. It is a nearly a fool-proof camera that takes perfect pictures almost every time. (I own the Canon Rebel G - very similar to the Canon 2000, but purchased in  1998)And I hate to confess this too, but...I take photos professionally.  (people pay me for my photos and they are published in the print media and  on the Internet)Shameful, I know, but it's true. With my little Canon  Rebel, I put the little thingie on the automatic setting, point, pause (let  the camera make its best decisions) and then shoot. I then drop the film  off at the local camera shop. (first few times, I had to take the whole  camera in because I wasn't sure how to unload and reload the film, although  that's pretty easy too)When I pick up the photos, they are just  beautiful. Now, I have had to learn some hard lessons about camera flash  and shadows, but that is hardly the camera's fault. Experience has taught  me a lot, there.In summary, I am not a camera person. I don't *want* to  be a camera person. But my Canon Rebel has paid for itself many times over  from the photos I've sold. It combines the best of modern electronics with  photographic excellence.And it has a dazzling display of options for  those who want to play with all the fancy features. But for me - I'm  sticking with the automatic thingie.I would highly recommend this camera  to others.THREE different people (that I know of) have bought this  camera, after watching me use it and then seeing the end results. (under  the &quot;good grief, if she can take good pictures, anybody can&quot;  philosophy.)They were all astonished that someone who knows so little  could take such incredible photos.Only downside - it is a delicate  camera. No forgiveness factor on dropping it. I use the STRAP faithfully.",5
A+++++++,5
Just started exploring the camera. I love the light weight and the auto focus/flash that pops up when required.My only disappointment was that when I got the unit I didn't realize there was a slightly different model available that lets you time/date stamp your photos. If I had known about  that other model I would have ordered it.Bought this camera after  having used my sisters. Can be as simple or complex to use as needed.,5
"I have had this camera for about 4 yrs now - I take it on all my business travels.Whenever I get a chance to go out on on the weekends, I take this camera and my Sony camcorder in my backpack, roam the streets of the new city and shoot pictures.  The pictures that I shoot from this camera are just awesome - no matter whatever experiment I do with it.Most useful features:1. Aperture control with Depth of field preview- Lets to focus the foreground and blur the background2. Shutter speed control upto infinity- Lets you control the amount of time for which the shutter can be kept open3. It is pretty rugged, dont try dropping it :) I have used it to shoot pics from 'Maid of the mist' in Niagara falls and I almost thought that I was going to lose it.  But it worked liked a charmNegatives- Bulky, but you will get used to it, it always gets attention- Cost of developing film - What I do these days is to just get the photos on a CD, then develop only those photographs that are good.Why is this camera better than a Digital Camera ?- If you are spending $200 on a Digital Camera, I feel that the SLR is way far too ahead of any Digital camera in that price range- If you are spending $1000 on a Digital Camera, a Digital SLRs are very mature today - worth buying.Ideally, I would buy this SLR, take this whenever I really want to take good photographs, then I would also want to have a $100 Kodak Digital Camera for casual shots.  This would mean an ideal combination.If you are buying this SLR, you can also consider buying a Film/Photo scanners (available for less than $150 now) - which lets you scan the negatives/positives without even going for a cheap CD print.  From the reviews what I read on amazon, these scanners must be amazing.",5
"Both camera body and lens appear to have been made in Japan.  But in using the equipment, will entail a lot of guess work, though.

So, please provide instructions on how to return everything.  The merchant, GLOBooks does not even have a a mailing address.  But nonetheless, I would like to know how I can return everything.Thanks.mike caguin5909 Panorama Dr. SE - #3-102Auburn, WA  98092",2
"I've been using Nikons for over 20 years, starting with my first used and battered Ftn. Over that time I've a accumulated a dozen Nikkor lenses and numerous accessories, as well as an assortment of bodies.One thing  that's been missing in recent years from the Nikon line is a reasonably  priced entry-level manual camera. The cheaper Nikons have tended to be  fully automated cameras, and the cheapest manual Nikon still being made  was, until recently, the FM2 at well over $500.If you work the way I do,  you need a manual camera  and don't have a lot of use for automation and  autofocusing. If you own an old Nikon and some old Nikkor lenses, you may  want a simple manual camera body that can accomodate them. If you're a  student starting out, or an artist on a budget, you need a manual  camera.If you fit into any of these categories, the FM10 is a great  choice. It may not be as rugged as a $1200 F3 or a $2500 F5, but it's well  made and should last many years. I'm not a fan of zoom lenses for my own  work, but the included 35-70 is a good quality lens with a useful range,  and you can add more lenses if you need them.All in all, a good value  and a long-needed inexpensive entry into the Nikon system.",5
"This 35mm is pretty much the perfect college kid film camera.  It wont spoon feed you when it comes to learning, which will really help you in the long run.  In the age of ""press this button and you're focused"", this camera is one of the few 35mm's left that doesn't have AF.  Also wont change exposure levels to what the camera suggests(such as AV or TV mode some cameras have), this gives you the freedom to be creative as some shots have a whole different mood if underexposed a stop or overexposed a bit.  As for manual focus, it's something you need to be able to do as a photographer.  Sometimes the computer in your camera just doesn't focus perfectly on that eye you want in focus, or for something as precise as macro photography which has very shallow depth you're going to need pinpoint accuracy that a computer can not do for you.This lens is great because it's like the vintage 35mm except you don't have to worry about the light meter or any other small part inside of it being broken.  Nor do you have to worry about the image quality.  The kit lens in this camera is very sharp.  It's a bit limiting considering it's f/3.5 so that rules out really low light(but grain can be good, unlike noise in digital; grain has an artistic quality), but considering the price and the quality of the whole kit it's great.Sure you can get a used one from the 70's or 80's for way cheaper, but chances are something is broken in that thing and you may not know until you've invested 2 hours developing the first roll in your class...So shell out a little bit extra and get this, it's worth it.edit 12-9-10:I still like this, shot some street photography with it since it's really compact compared to a big DSLR, but one big con I've found is build quality. It's got a lot of plastic, and I did drop it once which resulted in a huge dent. The silver parts look metal but they aren't, they're some sort of chrome paint covering more plastic. I don't baby my gear so this thing's starting to look kinda ugly.  It hasn't completely broken yet though.  I said the kit lens was sharp in my review, but really I now know it's not as good as I made it out to be, I recommend a used nikon e series 50mm 1.8 ais which can be had for cheap on the used market.",5
"Like many online reviews and even Wikipedia describe this camera, the FM-10 is a entry level film camera. Still, even though it lacks any kind of automation and (more important IMHO) a ground-glass pentaprism viewfinder (extremely important for depth-of-field preview with lenses faster than f/2.8), I believe that this camera is as good as any other SLR film camera. Furthermore, I doubt that any beginner or even more serious amateur photographer who would choose film over digital, has a desire for high automation features in such a camera. The FM-10 (manufactured by Cosina in Japan and sold under the Nikon brand) has a built in light-meter that requires two small batteries (provided with the camera) and is operated by a separate button on the slightly upper left side of the lens. Operating the meter button does require a shift in what would be the most natural and safest left hand grip of the camera, so that holding the camera in a steady position while using the light meter button becomes a bit uncomfortable, but that probably only goes for people with smaller hands like myself. Since most modern light meters suffer from a  biased factory calibration (meaning they would fail the grey card test), I am yet to run some appropriate tests as to check the accuracy of this light meter's calibration. On the positive side (and the right side of the camera), the depth-of-field preview button/lever, although not useful through the entire aperture range as mentioned above, is in a comfortable position and does fulfill its purpose at apertures starting from f/4 up. Although built on a metallic frame, the camera's body is mostly plastic. Personally, I don't think it feels cheap (no squeaky noises during handling) but I do feel like exercising caution at all times when handling it or placing it on hard surfaces, and I will think twice before taking the camera out in the rain, mist or extreme cold weather (I wouldn't care with a 35 yrs. old Nikon F1), rolling in the dirt or sand for nature close ups, etc. The camera case, although not made of quality leather as you might expect from a Nikon camera (but again, this is NOT a Nikon built camera), does provide a reasonable level of protection, except maybe for the top edges of the camera, where the attempt to leave the strap hooks come thru, has left those areas exposed to dust and other possible external damaging factors. It is also a bit awkward to remove and put back on because its edges always rub harshly agains the focus ring of the lens, which in time might create marks or even damage, especially on a plastic built lens like the one that comes with the camera. I would suggest looking for an older (much tougher and better built) leather case. The lens that comes with the camera is rated one of Nikon's worst lenses (check out Ken Rockwell's reviews for more info), but that doesn't mean you cannot take any pictures at all with it. A lens choice is always a matter of personal taste, as well as an educated choice for some users. The day I ordered my FM-10, I have also ordered a Nikkor 50mm f/1.2 manual focus lens, a mechanical and optical masterpiece suitable only for fully manual film Nikon SLRs at an unbeatable price compared to similar lenses built for digital or automated cameras. I have removed the bundled lens without even removing the lens cap and replaced it with the 50mm (much heavier as it is all metal built). For those who are not willing to &#34;waste&#34; $6-700 on a new fixed lens, I would suggest the older Nikkor 70-200mm AIS lens. You probably won't be able to find a new one because they don't make them anymore (as opposed to the 50mm above that you can get brand new), but you should be able to find one online in very good condition, anywhere between $100 and $400 depending on the seller. I got one for $220 in mint condition on eBay. Remember, the lens is the most important part of your camera and the decisive factor in the overall quality of your pictures (apart of course from your aesthetic and artistic feel). It remains to be seen how the not-so-high-quality of this camera will hold over time, but unless you want to go for one of the much older, bulkier (but better built) genuine Nikon SLRs, then the FM-10 is a good choice for the money, even if I consider the lens completely useless (that's just me). The reason why I didn't go for an old Nikon is because I couldn't find one from a reliable source. All sellers claim their old Nikons to be in perfect or good condition, most of them actually being completely unaware of any possible problems. Unfortunately, the slightest mechanical issue in an old Nikon SLR is very hard to detect, even harder to fix or re-calibrate, and ultimately renders the camera unusable (i.e. a slight shift in exposure time). With the money I'd pay for a defective Nikon F1 (rated in good condition) and having it fixed, I'd get a new FM-10, a leather case and some lens filters. Overall, even if I don't feel the same confidence (yet) as I used to with my old Zenit 11, I am happy with my new purchase and will try to get the best of it for as long as I can. I hope this helps you make the right choice for you.",4
"I ordered this camera for the sole purpose of using it in my black/white photo class. And so far i have been able to do everything required with this camera. The lens that comes with the camera is a great starter lens. you have the 35mm setting for to take some pretty good wide angle shots, and u can zoom in any where all the way up to 70mm. its a very versatile lens! some people think this is a ""beginners"" camera and while it is a great camera to learn on, even my photography teacher who has been shooting for over 35 years still owns one of these cameras and loves it. the body is not made out of metal like a lot of earlier nikons, but that doesnt mean this camera wont last you a good 40+ years if treated correctly.but i do however have some concerns.. My first issue was that the lens has a little bit of movement up by the focusing barrel. as in its not 100% tight. im not sure if all lens are like this or if its because this nikkor lens is maybe cheaper quality than other nikon/nikkor lenses. its not really anything big but i decided to exchange it and the next one i got was the same.also for a night photography assignment i had to do, i decided to shoot without a tripod but instead use some 3200iso film. my instructor said that i should be fine with 3200 because its very sensitive to light, hover i found my self only being able to shoot at f3.5 and with a 30/100 shutter speed! and i did set the cameras iso to 3200. dont know if thats normal or not.and finally one thing that was confusing about purchasing this camera on amazon was their very confusing product description that says these camera are ""refurbished"" yet when you look at the sellers and their listings, all of them are listed as new. my camera appeared to be new but i dont think there is a way to tell for sure.",4
"I have an Embroidery Machine that I purchased at the end of 2004. I did a lot of reading before using it and found out that SanDisk brand flash cards were highly recommended to use when storing purchased designs. They are the ONLY brand of compact flash that does not lose any of my designs (I had this happen years ago on a different brand of compact flash).I have bought almost 3,000 designs over the years and I always trust using a SanDisk Compact Flash card over anything else on the market!",5

"The most common application for this type of memory card is a digital camera, but these can also be used with a number of electronic devices, including the HP Jordana, and even your laptop computer with a PC Card adapter.  You can store any type of data on the cartridge, and they can be quickly changed between devices.  I have never had a problem with any of my SanDisk Compact Flash Cards.",5
"Though this card, 32 megs is minute, you still may only need that. I picked this up (about 4 1/2 years ago), when it was state of the art & about sixty bucks or so. I still have both cards! Well over 4,000 photos & bazillions of files!! Never a read or write error! I've never lost anything with it. Unlike the Lexar!If you're looking into compact flash cards, go with who started it. I have a 128mb sandisk, & am now looking into their 2 gig Ultra card, for my new camera. Because I want speed, & need the space for 8MP photos.The write/capture function is slow, it's not meant for speed. But for swapping & transferring it's faster than from cd (with the right reader/writer)!SD cards & micro drive are inching in, but Sandisk keeps imporoving the CF (they also make SD cards).There are cheaper & less expensive cards out there, but how important is your data/photo? You can't always retrieve your files, with the flash memory programs. I know. I used three of them on my Lexar, & NEVER got all of the images. But that just may be the cards I have, who knows? There isn't any quality control any longer, who cares? Sandisk is the most accurate.",5
"Commend added in December 2002: this review was written when 2 megapixel cameras were top of the line, and a 32 MB card costed over a hundred dollars. Now, the prices have dropped so much that the same review would be more applicable to a 128 or 256 MB card. - A.I.Nobody would argue that the more memory you have in your digital camera, the better. The question is what the reasonable compromise between the price of a memory card and its size is, and how to predict how much memory you actually need before you paid for it. I looked up some literature on the image compression techniques, and made some experiments with printing out pictures with different resolution and different compression ratios, and came to the following conclusions.Most cameras offer a choice between several picture resolutions and several image compression modes. Low resolution is good for on-screen viewing, while high resolution is better suited for printouts. It is not uncommon for digital photographers to take pictures at a resolution lower than the maximum allowed by their camera, although there seems to be no point of buying an expensive high-resolution camera to take low-resolution pictures. A probable reason for that is that their camera was shipped with a very small memory card and did not upgrade it yet. Unfortunately, high resolution images require lots of storage space: an uncompressed image taken by a 3 megapixel camera can be as large as 10 MB. JPEG compression, which is based on an algorithm specifically developed for image compressing helps to store large pictures in relatively small files. Specifically, JPEG compression algorithm divides an image into squares 8*8 pixels each, performes two-dimensional discrete cosine trasform of each of these squares, and compresses their frequency spectra by removing the high-frequency components or by decreasing their accuracy through a ""quantization"" procedure. While this review is not appropriate for a discussion of technical details of the JPEG algorithm, it is worth saying that JPEG analyzes each small ""brick"" of the image individually and adapts the level of smoothing/compressing to the image to be compressed. In fact, you determine not the size of the compressed image, but the level of its quality: the final size of the compressed file varies depending on each particular image. This ""adaptive"" nature of JPEG makes it very efficient: it takes advantage of the smoothness of monotonically colored parts of the image by achieving great compression ratios in those areas without significant losses in quality, and it is also good at rendering sharp contrasts in the image. Since JPEG standard was optimized to take into account the specifics of our perception of visual information (like mp3 compression of music files takes advantage of the way how we hear music), JPEG compressed pictures are almost undistinguishable from the originals up to the compression ratios of 1:8 to 1:12.Therefore, a combination of highest possible resolution of your camera with the ""fine"" (or ""best"") compression mode is a good choice for a digital photographer. If this combination of resolution and compression is used, a 32 MB memory card would be sufficient for about 36 pictures taken by a 3 megapixel camera, or for about 48 pictures taken by a 2 megapixel camera. This is equivalent to one or two rolls of film, which is not a lot, but usually suffices for a day of occasional shooting. Hence, it seems to me that a 32 MB memory card is a good buy for the most of us.Just the last comment: note that there are two types of memory, flash and SmartMedia. Check you camera manual which one you need. SmartMedia memory cards are slimmer, if I am not mistaken.",4

"When I purchased my digital camera (Kodak DC280) I included one of these for extra space.  The card works properly and was at a good price.  What else can you ask for?Not much, unless you find that you sometimes take lots of photos.  I guess that includes me.  In which case you'll wish that you purchased a larger card.  I bought the Viking 128mb card, and now feel completely prepared with the combined cards providing enourmous storage.  Unless you are going to be away for an extended period, I can't imagine needing more space.The bottom line is that this card works, but you need to really consider what your storage requirements will be so you can select the right size.",5
"I have a 32 MB Sandisk Compact Flash card for my Nikon Coolpix 950, a 2-megapixel digital cam.  This card will allow you to record about 50 pictures at the standard (640x480) resolution, so if you find you're not a  'power user' of your camera, it should be plenty - and the  dollars-to-megabyte ratio is right!However, if you regularly shoot at  higher resolutions such as 1600x1200 (i.e. 8&quot; x 10&quot; photo  quality), you won't be able to fit 20 photos on this card.  In that event,  you might want to think about going for their 96MB card (also available  from Amazon!)With this size card you might also want to think about  going for Sandisk's inexpensive USB card reader - it's up to 50x as fast  and a lot less hassle than hooking the camera up to the computer!",5

The MemPlug module, by PiTech, allows a Handspring Visor to use a CompactFlash (or SmartMedia) card as if it were an extension of the hand held's own RAM. I made the mistake of initially purchasing a CompUSA CompactFlash card but had to return it when it proved to be incompatible. The SanDisk is a winner.",5
"At 1024 x 768 resolution, this memory card holds 200-390 images on my  Polaroid PDC-700 camera (that's like 8-16 rolls of film).  The price and  capacity are just right for weekend trips or special events.  **Go crazy**  and take pictures of anything and everything that catches your eye!I  took 89 pictures in 5 hours at my company's &quot;Relay for Life&quot;  event on Friday, and really enjoyed not having to &quot;budget&quot; my  photos or worry about running out of film.  The image quality was  excellent, and downloading was quick &amp; easy with a digital film  reader.I'm planning a 2-week trip to Spain this fall, and am considering  an additional 32MB SanDisk memory card just in case I get **Too Crazy**.  Does anyone know if they make a storage case for spare memory cards?",5
"Makes my camera not obsolete.  I had a hard time locating this memory cardfor my old, old, old camera.",5
"Initially, when I bought my Creative Labs Webcam 3, the button was stuck. But after replacing it, I have had no physical problems since.This package includes a manual, the webcam, webcam software and some image  editing software. I never used the Image software so cannot say much about  it. The Webcam software is excellent, it includes the regular Video and  Image capture software but also has a motion detector program. This allows  you to capture images any time someone or anything passes the camera, great  for detecting if people are using the computer when your out.The quality  of the camera is great. 640 x 480 video capture is quite jerky, at about 12  fps average but at 320 x 480, the image is quite smooth sometimes exceeding  30 fps. The focus is a little dial on the lens, easy to adjust (Autofocus  would be nice though)This camera works well on Netmeetings and Cuseeme,  I have had no problems since. By the way, installing was quite easy, all  the programs installed from the installer, I had absolutely no  problems.All in all, this is a very decent package. I only once had to  talk to tech support and their service was prompt and helpful.",4
"I must say that this was a breeze (under 5 min) to set up.  I do not know why the others had problems. Pluged it in, Win98 picked up the new device, pointed it to the drivers on the CD, cranked up net meeting, and I was off!If you want fast top notch quality video, then spend more on a better  web cam, but if you just want a basic (with some cool features like zoom) camera for a very low price, then this is the camera for you.  I do not regret  buying it, as it was a great, cheap, way for me to get my feet wet with video conferencing, among other things.Enjoy.",5
"I bought this camera about 5 months ago and was really excited, considering this was my first web-cam.  It has worked reasonably well throughout this time.  The only complaint that I have with this cam is that  when I activate the camera software it deactivates my Internet connection.  Other than that it has been a great camera for not only the advanced user  but also the novice.  The picture quality is not bad and for the price you  really can't ask for much more.  As for the software it was also easy to  install and to use.",4
"Setup/installation of the camera wasn't perfectly smooth.  The instructions weren't 100% in line with the choices in Windows 98. Once installed, camera works easily.  Picture is not great, but clear.  The  manual focus is not that meaningful. The web update and &quot;watch&quot;  functionality work well.",3
I found this camera to have a very easy setup and great picture quality. I am running it on a Windows ME machine and it works wonderfully..,4
"I bought this because it was in my price range.  The quality isn't great, but it does what I need it to do.If you need a still or video PC camera for school, don't get this one.  Spend the extra money and get a really nice one.  If you just need a PC camera for instant messageing and sharing photos, this is a good camera.",4
"This is easy to install, easy to update (online), and very very easy to use. Don't expect super high resolution photographic excellence, but if you want to talk via video chat online, take snap shots, or send recorded messages this is the business.More than enough for the avergae computer user, highly recommended.",4
"This camera performs excellent under bright daylight.  The picture is clear and if you set the contrast right, images look great.  The only thing I dislike about the QuickCam is that it's very difficult to set it on a table, on top of the monitor, anywhere without it toppling back or falling sideways.  The round camera comes with a rubber base to put it on.  The round camera has something like a metal hook or screw on the bottom, and the base has a slit on top.  You're supposed to slide the screw back and forth on the slit in order to point it where you want to record, but once you get the angle, the heavy cable pulls the camera back and it goes toppling to the floor.  Very frustrating at the least.  I found myself moving towards where tha camera was finally pointing.Otherwise, the software is pretty easy to use, even though it takes very long to load.  I have Windows ME.  You can record videos of unlimited length.  I've had so much fun with this thing!",4
"Even if you just want this camera for casual use with your computer and are flexible about picture quality, you will probably have headaches installing the drivers.  I gave up on their mouse years ago, and I suggest avoiding this product as well.  I got it as a gift, and I found that with respect to camera, software, and overall quality this product is a loser.",1
"this camera is incredibly easy to install, it really is just plug and  play. you'll need to have video conf software like netmeeting or cuseeme -  the included software isn't worth installing, and the drivers on win98 cd  are fine. won't work with windows NT unless you've installed a usb hub and  drivers especially for NT4. win2000 seems to function ok with it. rotating  focus wheel is cumbersome if you're trying to focus the camera and aren't  standing right next to it. get the latest drivers from logitech (3com)  online. the image is not crystal clear, so don't expect the same quality as  you get from a digital camera, but if you are looking for cost, your  friends will be able to see you just fine with this one. the mounting stand  is a little wierd, and the camera cable makes it shift back and forth. i  had to tie down the cable so i could position the camera and it wouldn't  move. it's not worth investing in a stand for this one because of the  picture quality.",3
"I bought this camera to replace an older model of quickcam which looks the same and is also USB. I replaced it because for some reason Windows XP doesn't like it and it can't be used with XP since the OS upgrade. This camera installed easy but I had to D/L the XP software off the web as the software it came with is old. I expected at least the same quality as the other since it's been years and I now have the best OS available. NO!!! The picture quality is crap and can't be tweaked. There is this total grainy appearance to the images and the DPI seems much less even though its still 150DPI. Don't waste your money.....I don't see any resolution/quality differences with the more expensive models either....good luck,Mike",2
"Hey it's 30 bucks(roundabout). For that, the setup was trouble-free, and using it was a cinch. But personally, I wish for two things: that it wasn't colored white, cuz it get's dirty real easy. U leave it on top of your monitor, the dust collects and......Also, when I used Netmeeting, no matter how much I tried to focus, the pciture wasn't entirely clear. But again, for it's price, this camera is a sweet deal, and pretty cool looking too!",4
"Total junk.  Installer shut down, forcing a manual installation.  Image is grainy, regardless of settings, colors aren't right.  Horrible, avoid.",1
"These don't stop working when I sweat, which all of my other ones would do. love the handy case and the sound is good. I bought another pair I liked them so much.edited on 1-8-12. left earbud stopped working.",3
"I've had three pair of these now, going on nearly 10 years.  The only reason I've replaced my previous two pair was because I lost them!  One in a seatback on a plane.  They're quite durable.  The winding case helps avoid the usual wire failures.  The sound is good, not great, but I'm fine with making the trade for durability and convenience.  I laid in a second set as a spare for when I eventually lose them again!",3
"I have run through a lot of earphone this past year so I am getting to be rather an expert on the problems.  This is one of the best.  The sound is THE BEST I have found no matter the price range.  I especially like the smaller ear buds.  Some of others were an ""areaness factor"".  They were so big I was constantly aware of their pressure.  I don't feel these.  They are so comfortable, I don't notice anything but beautiful sound.  Full range from highs to low with no fuzziness or distortion.  Just pure rich clean sound.The cord is coated and reinforced, so will take wear.Great item, great price.So put on Clannad or Silly Tinkers and have at it!",5
"I have had these headphones for over a year and am 100% satisfied.  I use them exclusively for working out and running.  They have pretty good sound, a nice carrying case, and have survived over a year's worth of running.  I have not had any problems with them falling out of my ears or the wire shorting out.  In fact, I use a tie on the wire so that the cord is not so long when I run.  Despite this, no problems.This is probably the best pair of earbud-style headphones I have ever purchased.  I am so happy that I am ordering another pair.",5
"Update:  Durability is not as expected.  After a few months of moderate daily use (MP3 player in my shirt pocket) during my commute to and from work the connection between the wires and the stereo plug is beginning to fail.  Regular body movements will cause a break in the connection and I don't expect these ear-buds to last to the end of the year.  Too bad since they produce nice sound.----------------------------------------------------Had these for a few months before opening the package and trying them on.  First tried to use the buds as they were packed - without the little spongy covers over the buds - and was totally disappointed with a loose fit, weak midrange, scratchy treble, and almost no bass whatsoever.Finally got the brilliant idea of putting the covers on and giving them one last try ... Wha?!?!  Were these the same phones?  The buds fit much better in my ears and I had a totally different experience with great mids, good treble, and very decent bass.These earbuds won't change your life but they'll make your MUNI commute more pleasant by allowing you to block out the miscellaneous grunts and chirps made by your fellow transit commuters.Just remember to use the sponge thingys.",4
"I always use ear-bud headphones when walking, for some reason the over-the-ear headphones give me headaches. So I've always also just assumed that I'd never have clear sound. No more! These headphones are wonderful.The range of music I like is very much varied. These sound great for all types, and most surprisingly is their ability to handle resonant bass in some newer songs. I'm really amazed, actually. It's weird having sound that's as good as a nice stereo when you're walking the dog.One setback is that I need to use the foam covers because the plastic buds along fall out of my ears at the slightest tug of the cable. It's a setback for me. Maybe my ears are getting bigger as I get older? This has never been an issue. Regardless, it's a tiny fault for the best, cheapest headphones I've ever bought.",5
"I purchased these for sport use, and compared them with a set of Sennheiser earbuds I use at the office. The Sonys are a little more expensive, but they have better sound, more bass response, and fit my ears better. Although I'm a fan of Sennheiser products, in this case the Sony product is superior.",5
"I bought these earbuds for my CD player (at the time) because the ones I had before died on the right side. They were a pair of RCA behind the neck headphones I bought at Family Dollar for very cheap. I would buy another pair but now I have an iPod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable. I was planning on buying a pair of Philips earbuds at Target because (I thought) these were dead on the right side and I dislike the iPod earbuds, but when I plugged these into my iPod they worked fine. After a break-in session they sound even better.Well, they are only ten bucks, so what can you expect? Not a ton, not a surround soundstage and great, powerful sound, but maybe something that has at least average sound, are comfortable, and will last a decent amount of time. And thatt's mostly what I got with these earbuds.They don't have stellar sound (that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about), but they have decent sound that's good enough for the money. Not a lot of bass, but some pairs at this price have barely any bass. The mids on this pair are emphazised (but not by a lot, props to Sony). And they do have a good, clean sound to them, so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end.For other aspects of the earbuds, they are very comfortable and fit much better than the Apple earbuds, but feel better with the pads. I have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time. Also, these are some durable headphones so far, and after a half-year of use they still put up nicely.Overall, not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables. Already got a better pair? Keep these for some useful back-ups. They don't have amazing sound, but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price. 4 stars.NOTE: This is a waterproof version of the MDRE828LP earbuds. These would be a better deal if you are using them mostly outdoors.",4
"Like most websites I've looked for these headphones on, they're showing you the picture of the (now discontinued) MDR-V900, but if you look closely at the model number below, it's the cheaper MDR-V900HD.  Don't be fooled.",1
"About a month ago, I decided to get some better sounding phones to use in my studio.  I bought a pair of Sony MDR-v900, and a pair of Sony MDR-7506 from their pro-line.The v900 sounds fine for non-critical listening, but the 7506 shows much more detail.  If you really wanna hear what's in the mix, the 7506 is the ticket.The v900 does favors for low bit-rate mp3 encoded stuff, and it's pleasant to listen to...with a bit of a bump in the 100-200Hz region, but there's just not enough detail to be able to use for critical projects.I bought more pairs of MDR-7506...that should tell you something.  There has been some talk that Sony may discontinue the 7506...sure hope that doesn't happen.BTW, the consumer MDR-v600 is NOT the same thing as the pro-line MDR-7506.  The v600 sounds much more like the MDR-v900.",4
"The Sony V900 Headphones have a printed frequency response of 5-80,000hz and I believe it.  They are very sensitive and require a small amount of power to drive and can be driven to deafening levels.  They have great imaging.  The only thing that is wrong with them is that don't fit my head the way that they were designed and I have to wear them backwards with the right channel in the left ear and the left channel in the right ear.  I can wear them hours on end.I listen to mostly classical music, but right now I have some Lords of Acid on which is dance/electronic.  The response is fairly flat, but because the headphones couple with the ear so well the bass response is almost felt!  My opinion is that the sound of these headphones is fairly neutral.  Someone mentioned the Sony model 7506 which to me has a more forward mid-range.If you can't afford these headphones the Sony DJ MDR-700 seems to be just about the same, but a tad less comfortable.  It has about the same response and sensitivity.But I would recommend this model for long term use and happiness.  The only problem I have had is the ear-cups have worn out and that is because I am in Florida and sometime when coming in from the outside I have gotten the earcups wet and obviously they could only stand up to so much of that.",5
"These Headphones have lasted 5 years and now the Cord shield is deteriorating.  These Sony Headphones do sound really good, but would have to make some adjustments with placing them over my ears to get the great sound.These Sony Monitor Headphones are very good for home use which is what I purchased them for.  The music I listen to works well with these nicely; Meditation and Environmental Music files, also Drum Music.Sony has a great line of products, but the Construction of the cords are very poor.  If the cord had greater quality, then these headphones would have another star in my rating.As far as my recomendation is for these, Well, I can't make one since they only would last for five yrs.  I have used them a lot, but have starting using my Sony earbuds more, and even those seem to have poor cord construction.So because of the Very Poor Cord Construction, I would now suggest another brand for Headphones, or Earbuds.",3
"I have had a variety of Sony Headphones (and others over the years - Sennheiser, Nady, Panasonic, Pioneer, etc.) including the MDR V-700, V-300, V-7506 and others.  These MDR-V900 Monitors though are the best!  I use them for monitoring music, movies, and most importantly, I use them when playing my Bass Guitar at church.  They have a great ""boot'en"" bottom-end as well as a excellent very high upper ambience reproduction...they simply kick! I paid much more for them than that advertized on Amazon right now and I am considering buying other pairs for my drummer, sound technician, and guitarist for our church group.  My opinion is you can't go wrong with these babies!",5
"Initially bought these phones for home recording.  At first they were a little tight on my wide head, but after a while they broke in and were very comfortable.For recording, I found these phones to accentuate the bass a little too much.However, for ham (amateur) radio, they are excellent for discerning weak signals.A short wave enthusiast would probably also like these phones.",4
"This is my second pair and I have nothing but good things to say!  Comfortable, good bass depth and very durable. Volume control is a huge plus, especially in the workshop which is where I am most of the time.",5
"Listening to music through these headphones is like listening to music through a blanket.  Everything sounds muted, the highs don't extend very far, the lows are almost non existent.  Their sound is anything but clear.  Dynamics?  Forget about itI'm looking for a $20ish pair of headphones to keep in my backpack at all times.  I figured these might do the job...but wow was I wrong.I found the Sony MDR-XD100, which is actually cheaper, sound much better.  Did I mention the build quality sucks?  The XD100s are a little more durable but still leave much to be desired.  Perhaps that's just low end Sonys in general?I'm thinking about just dropping the extra few bucks for a pair of Sennheiser PX100s or AKG K81DJs.My main headphones are the Grado SR-80 and BeyerDynamic DT990s...I know what good sounds like.  All my music is either FLAC or 192 Kbps VBR mp3s.I'm giving these headphones a two star because I've heard worse...and much better for cheaper.",2
Item arrived quickly and in great condition.  I am very satisfied with the headphones and will probably purchase another set in the near future.,5
"I have the MDR-150's and these have the exact same sound quality. I have bought several different brands in various price ranges (all the way up to $100), and these are the best bang for the buck. I don't intend to use the built in volume control so hopefully the sound doesn't go out like some of the other reviewers have experienced. The only problem with these Sony's is that fake leather they put on the ear muffs.. it rubs off eventually and it will stick to your ears. Would buy these again if they last a few years.",5
For the price the best.  I have 3 pair of these headphones for all my various listening locations?  The volume control works great and very convenient .,4
"These are the only headphones I use now. I have been so pleased with them that whenever I want a pair I simply go to my previous purchase, click on the link, add them to the cart, and as if by magic, they appear at my doorstep in two days. I use a set at work, a set on the boat, a set for the stereo, a set for the music gear, etc, etc. Love these headphones.",5
"Was just listening to Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor with these phones.I'd say they reproduced the recording pretty damn well!Not excessively bright and just right in the minor classical music phrases.The phones are plugged into an Onkyo TX8211 (one of Onkyo's rock bottom receiversas I type this) at 3\5th's volume.Also been using these with a notebook and a couple of portable players.They aren't difficult for the lower audio output (battery powered) devices to drive.Happy to know these work very well with a mobile phone for listening to music.I have a hard time with the ear-buds for extended periods, they driveme nuts...I try to rate audio stuff based on what is being reproduced.A preference for listening has always been the best recordings I can afford.At times streaming music and other processed audio will be such a disappointmenteven from the best audio gear.Spent more than a few bucks on Beyers, AKG's and Sennheisers over the yearsall of which we could pay homage to, yet those don't matter here in this review.I think Sony does a good job of designing and making audio things in general.No complaining here...Rating the MDR-250V headphones a great buy in the $20-$30 range.If you own these I'm hoping you enjoy them as I have been doing...",4
I use these headphones with my Avid mbox mini and since I have set everything up I have stopped using the speakers with my computer as these sound better.  They are comfortable for wearing long periods of time without any complaint.  My wife will steal them to use on her laptop when doing school work for the same quality and comfort reasons.,5
"These headphones are great at this price! I already have the previous model MDR-V150 which are without the volume control and I wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume. My only complaint is that there's a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than 4 hours! Overall, the sound is great and very well balanced!",5
"Excellent price and service.  I like the volume control onin the cabel, comeswith two size input jacks.  2 Meter cabel is just fine for PC Use which I purchased it for.  Excllent product would recommend and will shop vendor again.",5
"I got mine in nov 2002 and i have used them primarily at work, which is sitting in front of a workstation for about 8-9 hours a day.most reviews have been very accurate. these are a bit tight even if you have an avg sized head. after about an hour of listening your ears do pain. i just got used to them and probly they have slackened up over time.but they are even more painful if you wear spectacles.also the cushion is pretty cheap and really not very helpful.the sound is decent. from my experience AVOID ANY HEADPHONES that have a volume controller since this is the weakest link in the chain. my headphones having finally given up at exactly this point. all in all they served me pretty well for 2.5 yrshope they made some changes to the model...",4
"These Sony headphones are a great option for the price range. The ear cups are very comfortable, even when wearing for long time periods, and they provide a decent sound in a variety of uses. These were bought for my boyfriend to practice on his electric drum kit, and he says it works well for that. I've used them in-flight to watch movies on my laptop and enjoyed their performance then, as well.Other reviewers have noted problems with the inline volume control, but I have yet to have an issue with that and have owned these since 2009, I believe. I enjoy the extra long length as this makes it easy to stand up and stretch or move around a bit during a movie (or the boyfriend's practice session), and not worry about getting your head jerked from the cord being too short.There is a moderate amount of noise cancelling with these headphones, but don't expect anything excellent in that department. With heavy music going you'll know someone is speaking to you, but will not know from which direction or what the person is saying.I do feel that the audio quality is poorer than you'd get with a much higher priced headphone setup, but for this price and intended use, I cannot find any reason to not give these 5 stars.",5
These are great headphones for the money. I have a home recording studio and use these when I play. They are light and comfortable and have plenty of bottom end. This is one step up from the MDR-150. The only difference being the inline volume control. These also sound great with my phone or MP3 player.,4
"I do not understand the negative reviews.  I have had these headphones for years.  I wear them at work for hours at a time and can say from experience that they are comfortable. I really appreciate the volume control on the cord.  Unlike another reviewer, I have had no problems with it. I normally use these with either my computer or my iPod classic, listening to music, podcasts and audio books.  They sound pretty good for the money. They have also held up well.  Of course, they don't sound as good as my more expensive Sennheiser phones that I have at home.  They are just beginning to wear out, so I may be getting another pair just like them as a replacement.  There might possibly be better sounding phones for the same price, but I can say that these are comfortable and have lasted a long time and sound good enough for most purposes.  I don't think that you could do much better for the price.Update:I have had them for about 5 years and they finally broke. I am going to replace them with the same model. I use these at work and the in-line volume control is important to me in my work situation.  I can say from 5 years of experience that they are durable, comfortable and the volume control held up well for me.  The sound quality is adequate.  If you don't care about the volume control feature, as most people probably won't, you might want to spend a bit more on better sounding ones. For $20, I don't think that you could do very much better.  If you are after top sound quality, you probably aren't looking at these anyway, but I recommend the  Sennheiser HD555.  That is what I use at home.",4
"Perhaps I'm just used to real studio headphones, but these don't even sound as good as my in ear monitors.  I'd like to give them a break for only being $20, but considering the fact that these are practically unusable without a high boost and mid cut EQ, it's hard to justify the purchase.  I just do not know why these lack so much high end and boost the 250-500k frequencies so much.  After cutting these frequencies in iTunes, they don't sound bad, but you shouldn't have to run an EQ to get a decent sound.  Only thing I like about these is the inline volume control.Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks on a higher end model.  You'll be happy you did.",1
"-Lightwieght-Durable...so far-Excellent Bass-Good Treble-Very Crisp Sounds-Affordable-Cool Design-Fairly comfortable (I don't find it too hard on my ears even after 5+ hours of wearing them, but I have small ears).",5
"These are a great pair of headphones, very sleek and stylish. I'ved use these headphones for years and they have worked without any issues. The sound quality is not the best but is better than most headphones in the same price range. The extra long cable makes it perfect if you are connecting this to a TV in a living room.",4
"These are better than $20 headphones, and worse than $80 headphones.Pros:- Decent sound- Long cable, easy to plug into far-away things- Great as headphones for the gym, if you're not into earbuds. Lightweight, pretty sturdy, and stay on your head well. Best of all, they don't get too sweaty.Cons:- After a couple years of light use, ear pads will wear out and start shedding little bits of black crud. Replacement ear pads cost $6 to $12.- Poor at blocking out external sounds, since they don't cover the entire ear. They'd be lousy for office use, since they offer no real isolation.",4
"I've owned this product, bought thru Amazon, for about 3 months.  The sound quality is superb!  My Ipod tones are much louder and richer, and I have to decrease the volume on many songs instead of wishing I had more volume with those annoying Ipod earbuds.Please do not purchase this Sony headphone from the Apple website, or you will wind up paying about 20 dollars more for it after base price, tax and shipping.  Sony has another winner in these headphones.",5
The construction is on the frail side but the sound reproduction is superb. It is lightweight and comfortable for long hours.,5
"Pros: Good sound for the price, and nice long cord, and they look nice.Cons: They fit too tight, and I couldn't adjust it.",3
"I've had these headphones for about 2 years and are great for the average casual music listener.COMFORT:I primarily use them at work, and finally found these that are comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time. They are a nice mid-sized, not too big not too small, ear cup. They are not over ear cups, the padding will rest on your ears...but they are good enough to not be uncomfortable after hours of listening. The band is sturdy and the size does not squeeze on my head.STYLE:Nice and not overly bulky like the over-ear headphones. The ear cups swing in and up for portability, but they dont fold flat. The cord is VERY long. I usually keep mine bundled up with a rubber band so it's not all over my workspace.SOUND:These are no BOSE, but given that and the low cost...the sound is actually very good. Bass is respectable but not earth-shattering. Mids and highs are clear and seem to sound pretty good from my novice perspective. I listen to all sorts of music and haven't noticed any distortion at any range and only sometimes wished for a little more bass.",4
"I'm wearing my headphones now listening to music on my laptop, which is good.  The bad news is that my right earpiece is attached with shoe-goo because it broke and there was not enough surface area to just glue the stem piece.  That is to say, the whole earpiece is glued solid to its bracket so it doesn't move.  The over-the-head thing is taped together with packaging tap because it, too, broke when I put the things on my rather large head.  They sound fine and all, but I could make a more durable headphone set out of balsa wood.  Do not consider these things portable unless your bodyguard is willing to carry them in a padded suitcase.Maybe I should just glue to the earpieces to my head.",2

"As I was finding myself getting ready for a long couple of weeks of temporary duty in Guatemala and in need of a good set of headphones for a portable DVD player to watch movies while sitting in a tent, I went to the trusted brand name of Sony.  The Sony MDR-V300 Traditional Collapsible DJ Style Headphones fulfilled this requirement in the usual wonderful manner that Sony products so often do.As I lay in the tent watching movies with these outstanding headphones on, the audio tracks on the DVD's were played wonderfully, enhancing the movie watching experience to perfection, giving a theater style performance..  While these headphones do not drown out ambient noises completely as they're not advertised to do so, they do keep a majority of the ambient noises to a minimum making the experience that much better.For price and quality, one can hardly do better than to make the decision to purchase these outstanding headphones and I highly recommend them to any and all who find themselves in need of a good pair of headphones.  I expect to get several years of good use out of these headphones and have high confidence in the quality and high standard of performance in this, another outstanding Sony product!  {ssintrepid}",5
"I purchased these for my father several years ago as a christmas gift for use in his home studio.  He plays steel guitar, telecaster and records through professional equipment + pro tools.  These deliver an exceptional, above average sound quality that is markedly different than the lower model V150's (which we also have several of).  Over the years, my Dad wore these to bits.  The foam on the earpads was coming off completely and it was time for a replacement.  Unfortunately, the replacement model that is now available in the stores doesn't compare at all to these.  Thank goodness I was able to get them from Amazon marketplace.  I will probably buy yet another pair and put them away.  A great quality product at a great price!",5
"Looking for good headphones for my iPod I came across these. Sound quality (to my ears) is rather good and clean, with deep bass (very good for synthesized dance/electronic music or neo soul music which are usually bass heavy, but my Jazz and Rock sounds great too).Lightweight, it fits snugly over my head and onto my ears and in an office or home environment, blocks out most of the surrounding sound, leaving you to hear just your music. It doesn't block out much subway or airplane noise though.On the downside, the much touted foldability doesn't fold it down to miniscule proportions as I'd hoped, and I find I have to wind up and tie up the 3m long cord. Other than these minor gripes, I'm a happy camper!",4
"Real clean highs, and good clean lows.  Deep deep bass doesn't penetrate that loudly with these phones, they still are better than everything else in their price and size range.Most suited for portable digital music  devices.  Some of the other &quot;studio&quot; headphones suck up all your  portable player's amperage, this one needs less juice to give you louder  sound.I use them with a mp3/fm player, and have found that the mdr's  long cord makes for great FM reception, (even when most of its length is  folded up somwehere).These headphones have a weak spot on the headband  where two peices of plastic meet.  I broke it on one side, duck-taped it  fixed, and then broke it on the other side as well, (just for stuffing it  in to a jacket pocket).  So don't test the plastic.  It can't take  pressure.Before you get these ones, look at the Sony MDR-501LP  headphones listed in 'similar products'.  They look like great sounding  headphones...",3
"These provide excellent sound, comfort and they are fairly durable. A very good sound experience for the price.",5
"This is the best headphone I have found for watching TV or listening to voice.However, for music it is sibilant, harsh has too much treble. Bass is weak.  Extremely fatiguing.I own or have owned just about every high end headphone on the market.  Overall these are better than most $35-40 headphones, but both the Koss Porta Pro and Sennheiser PX100 in the same price range are vastly more musical, lighter weight and more portable.However, the reason I keep these around is because I have never found a better headphone for TV watching or listening to spoken recordings.  I can make out very clearly with little strain, exactly what is being said.  They are quite comfortable and the long cord is nice.",4
"I was super happy when I first received these headphones.  The quality of the construction is great!  For the price of the headphones, you are getting a steal!It comes with a 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; adapter, and all contacts are gold-plated.  The headphones can fold in for easier storage, and the cable is super long, just in case you use it to listen on a sofa(away from your stereo system).I am happy on making this purchase for this headphones, and I am very sure it will satisfy just about anyone in terms of sound quality.",5
"I've been using these at work for 5 years now.  They are sturdy, the sound quality is fine for the price, and they come with a really long cord in case you happen to be running them under a desk into a PC.  These are a great value if you are not looking for high quality sound.",4
"These headphones have nothing but boomy bass. Highly imbalanced sound. I am sort of an audiophile, but when i bought a $35 headphones, i did not expect the moon and the stars. Sad to say i was let down. the basic headphones that came with my discman sound clearer than these.Tried them out with my Dell Laptop, Sony Discman and Harman Kardon amp. Bad performance in every case. Allowed 20 hours of break in, still only slight difference. They sound as if the music is lost somewhere within and all you hear are muffled thuds. This is not at all expected from a respected brand like Sony. I would give a total thumbs down to this product.If all you want to hear is boom and dont care about clarity or balance in sound then maybe this is for you, else stay away. I am returning mine.",2
"Let me begin by saying that these headphones are advertised as &quot;for DJs/for studio use.&quot;  Given this, one would expect Sony to be targeting their DJ audience with these headphones.Which they most certainly did not!While the audio quality of these headphones is quite impressive for the price (surpassing the similarly priced v600s, if you ask me), the fact that these are designed for DJ use bothers me because they lack in volume.  Even with both headphone &amp; master volume maxed on my mixer (pre-amp), I find myself struggling to hear what's happening on the channel B while channel A is playing over the speakers.Kick in the extra cash and get the v700s, which outperform these in every way possible and are much better suited for live performance use.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for a set of headphones for home use, these are a reasonable consideration.",3
"1/2 the price of my neighborhood electronics store Bestbuy.  That sums it up, it would have been even better with a bag!",4
I love it!  Nice sound and noise reduction capability... and my friend says the girls them love it too.It got caught in a taxi door and it still keeps on kicking too so that is a plus.,4
"I'm going to start with the GOOD: The sound is OK.  Highs and mids are decent while bass lacks a bit.  Construction is really durable, I like how there's no exposed cable other than where it runs to the player.  If you fall asleep with headphones on like the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 that have an exposed cable above the earcup you'll likely form a break in the cable from sleeping on it.  Not so with these cans.  Also the cable is nice, thick, and it's coiled.The BAD:  It's almost impossible to listen at an enjoyable volume and be polite.  Even at just 50% volume on my Zune people across the room can hear what I'm listening to.  This is a big reason I don't like these.  If you don't care if you annoy people I guess it's ok.They can get uncomfortable in long listening sessions (like after 45 min or so), sometimes near the end of an album I have to take a break.  The headband or whatever that holds the cups to your ears is just too strong/tight for an adult head.  It's fine for short sessions.I actually had a pair of Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 before these.  I fell asleep in them too often and the problem I described earlier with the cable happened so I got these to replace them.  I liked the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 better than these even though they have that bit of exposed cable by the earcups making them vulnerable to break if you fall asleep in them.  They were about the same price, but they were much more comfortable and sound was better ten-fold.",3
"After talking to my brother about how much I love my Sony MDR 7506s and even letting him try them on he told me he wanted a pair just like them but I didn't have the money to order them for him for Christmas my dad went to Best Buy and bought him these DJ V500s. While half the price of the 7506s the V500s are probably the best headphones that you can get for 50$. I won't tell them this but I think that the 7506s,V6s and even the Sony V600s sound better than these and are more durable. However since he loves them and they're cheap it seems like a good deal for him but after reading how easily these DJ headphones break I really don't think these are worth replacing with the same model once every year especially when the 7506s sound at least twice as good and can last several years longer.If the V500s break every year I may just have to convince my parents to buy him the same model of headphones I own(which I saved up for and bought with my own money).",4
"Average at best, if you are using for djing, you might want to consider another headphone unless the mixer have a pre-amp. I am having to put both left and right sides of headphone on to hear the cue track. Hope that helps.",3
"Sony DJ version of the headset MDR-V500 and up has been great quality in terms of strong cabling material and durable ear piece. My first headset last me more than 10 years. That is with normal wear and tear. Its worth it. The price is not expensive and generally can't be compared with expensive Bose headphones or the higher headset from Sony.  It perfectly price for it purpose, not expensive and works better than the ear bugs piece.",5
You will be very pleased with the quality of the sound from these headphones.  Good cord length to.  Priced right.,5
"Well, I embarked on finding a new set of travel headphones after my last long plane ride.  The earbuds just weren't hacking it, even though the pair I have are quite good.  The jet engine noise finally got to me.I have an old pair of Sony MDR-M77 headphones which are quite good, but I wanted something new.  So, I studied what was available and settled on the MDR-V500DJ headphones.  After purchasing a pair, I regret my choice and I am returning them.When I got these headphones, I immediately plugged them into my iPod and picked a favorite cut from XTC (Mayor of Simpleton).  As I listened to the song, I kept wondering what was wrong,  Then, it dawned on me, the treble was entirely muffled.  I grabbed the MDR-M77 and did a A-B test with several tracks.  Same result.  The MDR-V500DJ has little or no high-end.  Just as a sanity check, I grabbed my Sony MDR-V6 phones and did the same test.  I consider the MDR-V6 one of the best headphones ever made by the way.  Yeah, the bass was definitely richer than the MDR-M77, which seem bright in comparison, but both were much closer to what I expected than the MDR-V500DJ.I thought it might be the iPod, so picked a coupled of CDs (MFSL Dark Side of the Moon & Bernstein in Berlin-Beethoven Symphony no.9) to try in my portable CD player.  Same result.  While the MDR-M77 was the brighest of the three, the lack of high end on the MDR-V500DJ made neither CD sound good.  Once again, the MDR-V6 was the best and most balanced of the three.Still seeking the perfect lightweight headphones, I went to a local Magnolia Hi-Fi to try a better comparison.  I tried both noise cancelling models from Sony, several Sennheiser models, the MDR-V600, MDR-V500DJ, and MDR-V300.  First of all, forget the noise cancelling models.  None of them sounded as good as MDR-V500DJ.  The MDR-V600 was the best of them all and reminded me of the MDR-V6 (which I understand they replaced).  The MDR-V300 is definitely better than the MDR-500DJ by a long shot, and I would say the MDR-V300 is comparable to Sennheiser HD-212.  I am going to try them side-by-side at home soon.Although many of the Sennheiser phones sounded good, they seemed over-priced compared to the MDR-V600.  The only one that was close in price and quality was the HD-280.  By the way, the HD-280 was uncomfortable and put a lot of pressure on my head.Unless you like listening to bass only, do not buy the MDR-V500DJ headphones.",2
I have been beating these around for 9 years now and they are just as great as the day I bought them.  Still intact no sign of wear and tear.  Love the fold up design.  Glad to see they are still making these.,5
"These sound awesome, and I am not a DJ.  I was just looking for some old fashioned, ear thumping headphones.  I love the way that they fold up and I love the strength in the cord.  The only negative thing that I have to say is the ear sweat you will suffer from having these on your head as you rock out.",5
"If it is music, gaming, movies, or whatever, these headphones are great.  Comfortable to wear with high quality music.  The swival ears are great if you need to keep one ear semi open to hear events around you.Only negative would be the ear pieces tend to fit on the ear as opposed to around them.",5
"Anyone looking to purchase these headphones should note: they were designed and advertised for DJ use specifically.  And by DJ, I mean the live-performance variety, not the studio-technician variety.And, for DJs, these headphones are excellent.The actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for DJ use, with easily folding, individually rotating cups for single-side monitoring.  They are also designed to rest close to the ear which, although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening, is ideal for DJs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes (I've used these in both a small party and club setting, and have found the non-electronic cancellation to be more than adequate for both).The actual sound styling is typical of Sony, with the quality generally reflecting the price.  I listen to a variety of music through these: in addition to hip hop &amp; house for club use, i listen to various other electronica, various rock, lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella.  The headphones perform admirably in all cases.  The bass is strong without being overbearing, the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercing.Please note my initial admonition again, however: these headphones are designed for DJs.  For your money, you can probably find a better set for home use by Sennheiser, or similar, which aren't geared torward performance/studio use.  In addition, other reviewers are right: the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use (I found that after about 30 minutes to an hour of home use, I felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit, as these fit tight and are a bit heavy).  The only reason I would ever recommend against these for DJs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time, because they are slightly heavier than the v600s and the extra weight, while usually unnoticable, can become an issue if you're spinning upwards of five or six hours.",5
"I'm an International DJ doing Trance, Rave, D&B, Ambient, and Dubstep. I've owned these headphones for 8 years and they truly NEVER fail me. No matter how hard the bass drop, No matter how long a Trance chorus, They've never popped a speaker and never quit. If you're a REAL DJ and you need a headphone that will last you past a decade then get a pair of these. Armin Van Buuren doesn't use them for no reason, and other Professional DJ's know where its at; Sony MDR-V700's.",5
"This is a professional DJ headphone that is seen on numerous DJs, even after having been taken out of commission from Sony (update model is the Sony MDR-V55/BR). The ear cups can be comfortably moved around on your ears as well as worn in a way that lets you listen in on one piece while hearing the output on external speakers. They can also be folded in for easy traveling and are light for their size. As for the sound, hip-hop and house music sounds great although I wouldn't use these for jazz or classical. And although these cans were not introduced as noise-cancelling headphones, they do a very good job at it anyway. I've used them while traveling on flights as well as on subways and almost never hear outside noise. Plus, they achieve this without making your ears feel uncomfortable. Overall, great product for recording/mixing or general listening purposes.",4
"This headsets retails from Sony for $149.99 which is not bad at all. The fact you can get em cheaper here is simply a plus. The cord is a 10 foot coiled cord that does carry some weight but is not to much to handle. The ear cup design is great, most sound becomes blocked out even before the music starts. The leakage isn't bad when the cups are over your ears but it does leak if a cup is exposed. The overall construction is pretty solid. They are plastic but seem to be pretty heavy duty. They flip up out and in nicely making a perfect fit for one under the chin or on the back of the head if you are trying to que up. You will hear sounds that you didn't know exsisted before. I'm not making that up either. These headphones are designed for DJ's to use while playing, that means they have to hear every line in the song. I've seen some people say that they aren't good for portability but I say their wrong. Yeah they are big headphones but no less portable than the over-rated Beats By Dre that take up just as much space. I highly recommend these head phones to any one willing to get rid of their ear buds.",5
"i'm a professional dj, and i've been using my mdr.4700dj for almost ten years.  they're the best dj monitor headphones i've owned.  i know many new products (such as the popular pioneers) have come out since; and to be honest, i haven't tried many of them; but these sure beat all the cans i used in the past.  when you first get them, you might get confused about how to fold them back up. i think i was confused for a little, but maybe i'm just not that bright.  the sound is great, and the construction is definitely solid.",5
"... and still going strong. I love these headphones. I've traveled with them a lot. I put them on and I'm transferred to a different world, a tranquil world.I'll buy another pair when these expire. :)",5
"I bought these in a local store probably in 2002 or 3. They've made it to/from many lans and halfway across the country. They are used on a daily basis and abused from time to time. Never once have I had a complaint about these. Great sound and great build, don't hesitate to purchase.",5
"The design is by far the best part of these headphones.  They are very clean and appealing to the eye - and they fit on your skull like a glove.  They seem fairly durable but who knows - they may break tomorrow... that would be a con.The sound is pretty clean and detailed at high volumes, but definitely distorts at very high volumes... especially with the bass up.Bass is not as impressive as you would hope for this price, but bass isn't everything.  The full-range acoustics are nothing short of a amazing in comparison to other the cheap sets I've owned.Pros - style, fit, storage, crisp full soundCons - semi-fragile, poor bass, tight fit on head, distortion at high volumes** UPDATE **(December 24, 2012) These haven't broken yet - guess they aren't as fragile as I though.  They still work great and have gone through mild abuse.",4
,4
"I bought these headphones for there great specs which they live up to. I listen primarily to classical music, but these are good for Rock and Pop as well. The bass is big, deep, and roomy.  Your amplifier doesn't need much power to drive these and you can drive them to deafening loudness levels with no distortion. Even with the remarkable bass there is excellent imaging in the midrange and treble.  The bass doesn't overpower the rest of the frequency range. Right now I am on the fence as which I would recommend: these Sony 700's or the Sony 7506's.  The 7506's just seem a tad more accurate.  If you are into Rock or Pop more and like beefier bass then I would opt for the 700's.  I have no long term use with either.  So I will defer to others as far as long term durability.",5
"bought this phone just for casual usage, to listen music and movies at home.on the plus side, the quality is awesome, excellent bass and good isolation from external noises.on the minuses, this thing is bulky and super heavy. It causes too much pressure on your head and hurts just a few minutes after putting them on. Also the cups make way too much heat, and you can barely stay with them on after an hour or so.It may be a good headphone for DJs (that are constantly putting them on and off), but for continuous usage there may be better options.",2
"I bought this item nearly 10 years ago in a supermarket for 375 Eur (~$450) when it was brand new!They're awesome headphones, about 4 years down the road the rubber starts peeling off, revealing the fabric to cover the ears.These headphones are quite loud, but 24ohms, so they're not as loud as a 4 ohms headphones, but make up for their sound quality.They are very neutral phones, sounding quite even in the whole register. If you're mainly doing techno and house stuff, you might as well go with the much cheaper Sennheiser HD505, not for sale anymore.They have the Sennheiser 202 which are very close to the 505's. SOundwise they sound about just as good, little less mids, just as loud (if not louder), just as good lowend, crisper brights. I find the senheisers better sounding than these sony's, although these sony's sound more linear, less crisp, more evened out in sound.these sony's are better for overall listening, like a variety of styles ranging from classic,to jazz, to pop etc... The Senheisers are better for techno, house, pop, dance, r&b;, hiphop etc...If I can compare these 2 headphones (as they're all I have to compare eachother with),I'd go for the senheisers, because they're less than a quarter the price of these sony's and overall just as good.If you're an audiophile, wanting to get the best, obviously these sony's are better, but not by much. In fact, most people might not even hear the difference even if they had to A/B them.",4
"I bought these because they were one of a few Sony models that have 50mm drivers. My MDR-CD580 set has been flying colors all the way, so Sony may as well have already had my money for these. In hindsight, I should have shopped more or been willing to spend more money.I'm not a DJ but I selected these based on the specs for sound quality. Great sound they have in abundance, comfort they do not. My ears got quite uncomfortable and did so quite quickly. I had some foam padding handy, so I cut some foam rings and inserted them under the covers and now I can wear them longer. They still get uncomfy after a while but it's not as bad.My only other con is the cord. It would have been nice if it were removable and it would be more functional to me if it were not coiled. I'd rather have the slack than the tension.Since I have not owned these for a long time, I can't speak for the structural integrity issues that I've read about, but I don't really travel with them. With any luck I'll get more than a few years out of them.If you don't plan to use them for long periods of time, or if you have some spare foam padding lying around, you might have trouble finding better sounding headphones for the price. The 50mm drivers make a noticeable difference.",3
"These headphones are a must buy. They are very comfortable and have really good sound. I use them for music, games, movies, and tv shows that I play on my computer and the sound is terrific. They have just the right amount of bass, and are really good for games especially. I would recommend these headphones to anyone. In order for these headphones to last they have to be taken care of really carefully because the plastic that holds the cups on will crack if you're careless. Overall, these headphones are a great purchase and I will buy these again.",5
"I bought these back in 2010 and never get sick of them!Can crank them up full blast without 0 distortion!They make everything and anything sound so much better!And actually has a cord long enough so you can stand up, walk around, an dance, which they will make you want to do, when you are wearing them!The fact that they are that good and there must not be anything comparable being made probably explains why the price has skyrocketed since I bought mine.",5
"I have a set of the Sony MDRV700DJ Studio Monitor Headphones that I use for sound re-inforcement while playing my Bass Guitar. They are incredable and simply can't be beat.  I have used other so-called ""High-end Units"" from other manufacturers and nothing comes close!  I would recommend these headphones for fellow musicians, for audiophiles, for basic music listening.  They simply can't be beat for the sound quality, bass reproduction...",5
First off these Headphones have the same sound Technology as the Sony Professional Headphones!  The only difference is that these have a DJ style.  I also enjoy the slinky/coil type of cord.  I enjoy the headphones very much!,5
"I was looking for an upgrade from my tinny sounding JVCs. The sound quality is far superior to the JVC and the music doesn't sound like its coming from a tin can.My only complaint is as one other reviewer mentioned, the comfort. After a little while the phones become painful around the ears. This may be due to the weight or the design. Still, I will use these headphones as long as they last or I cant stand the discomfort any longer.As far as the cost, I bought mine for $36.00 direct from China via EBay. Not bad.",4
"It's unfortunate that these are being discontinued (if they haven't been already) because these are AWESOME.  I have long since let mine go, but I regret it everyday.  I recently got some skullcrushers and I think they're okay, for the price, but man.. I really wish I still had these.  I have to say though, some of these prices are kinda outrageous, but they hold up really well, so a gently used one is a very good option.  Good luck, and keep on the beat!",5
"These are fantastic. I'm a DJ, but now find myself toting these around everywhere because I just don't want to listen to my music without them. My fiance is not a DJ, but steals these from me all the time.- They can take way more volume than you can likely handle without distortion.- They are sturdy, have a coily cord that's only connected at the left ear, and fold neatly into a little bad (included).- They totally block out outside noise. At a gig, you can't hear what you're pumping over the speakers if you don't want to. At a coffee shop, no one can tell your music is outrageously loud.- Intense rich bass. Even when you really crank the volume, it's like the bass vibrates your head, instead of blasting your eardrums.A really neat little trick with these is to put them on full volume, and hold the ear cups together. You can barely hear a thing, but you can feel the bass thumping in your hands. When you open them, you'll be shocked at how much volume they're putting out.One last note, I bought the 1000's, was disappointed, and bought these. Definitely the way to go.",5
"These are the most bass heavy headphones I've ever used, and I've used and owned a lot of high end headphones, including Grado up to SR-225, Sennheiser, HD-535, HD-570, HD-580, HD-595, HD-600, and a high end Denon of which I can't remember the model number.For a bass enthusiast this set is what I'd recommend - Sony MDR-V700DJThey aren't as clear at the higher end Sennheisers I've owned, but they are at least in the same ball park of quality (they aren't destroyed by the Sennheisers as far as clarity, but they do have much more bass than the Sennheisers. Sennheiser prides itself on making a flat EQ (meaning, typically not much bass.) If you're a bass hound just sick with these Sonys. I had a high end pair of Denon's too and they weren't as all around good as the Sony's in my opinon. With the 50mm drivers you can actually feel them vibrating on your head with a good bass lick --- I've never felt that with any pair of headphones.  They are quite comfortable too!Use caution when buying these headphones used or on ebay. There are a lot of imitation chineese ripoff brands that are exceptionally cheap in build quality in comparison, but look like a very good counterfeit. Most negative reviews on these headphones have GOT to be from the chineese knockoff imitations sold new and used on ebay, because my set is over a year old now and work perfectly after being dropped a couple times even.  They are durable, and IMO of very high quality.",5
"I got this for a friend over a year ago & barely now they're showing signs of use. Sony deff made a good job on this one.The bass lines are so neat & clear...and no matter how high you put the volume, still sounds clean.",5
"Like other reviews, the swivel points for the ear cups are plastic and will eventually break.  Mine did.  Buyer's remorse scale: 9.5 (10 being worst)Don't waste your money!",1
"These headphones are very clean.  Highs are crisp and lows offer no distortion.  However, the low end response is not so good.  At normal listening levels, I would like a lot more bass response and it's not there.  If you crank up the volume, then the bass starts coming in.  But I don't listen to music that way.Hope this helps in making a decision.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought something different.",3
"I've tried a LOT of headphones and earbuds over the years.  I returned four different pairs of various brands before I bought these Sonys.  They blow the competition at this price away, and lots of more expensive models as well.  I've had mine for over two years and they are in pristine condition.  I use them almost every day and drag them around everywhere with me and they have held up admirably.  The balance and sound quality are exquisite, and I don't hand out compliments that easily.",5
"The bass is really heavy on these. The build quality is not that great. I think they look really cool. I had to adjust the bass on my stereo because my ears were getting fatigued and gave me a headache, after I did that I didn't have the problem again. These are designed for DJ's. If you want something to listen to at home and you aren't worried about sound leakage get some open air cans. The  Sennheiser HD600 ($260) are some of the best around. If you really want closed headphones in $120 price range get the Sony MDR-V600 Studio Monitor Series Headphones. Sony headphones are notorious for the ear pads falling apart. It took me a lot of time and money before I found the sound experience I wanted. Always listen before you buy, everyone has different preferences in sound. If you are serious about music check out the Sennheiser HD 650, seriously amazing. You might consider pairing it with a headphone amp (this is not a portable setup). I'd check out the Schiit Asgard, they have a 15 day trial or something, but there are many, many other ones out there and you might be happy without out it. I picked up an old stereo receiver for $30.",2
"Sound quality is amazing. Noise reduction is pretty good too, can't hear anything once I have these bad boys on.",5
"Forget what you have read, these are the best dj headphones in the market (I should know, i'm a dj). i've had the same pair for two years straight. i'm guessing that the people who say they're flimsy doesn't take care of them.  now for the review: they are very comfortable, they're loud (just the way i like it) because of their design, you don't hear the ambient noise at all (love that). if you're a dj, the single cup function is great. now the money maker:the bass, you just don't hear the bass, you feel it, they actually vibrate when the bass kicks in. in my opinion, these are the best headphones EVER!!!",5
I bought a pair at a box store at least 7 years ago. I think there great. I live in an apartment now and I use them a lot more than I did when I had my own place.,5
"I always order these. They seem to last longer for me than they do for other people. Maybe it's in the care, I don't know. I keep using these and they never fail me.",5
"For the price, these headphones are very hard to beat in terms of sound and comfort. I highly recommend them.",5
"I have had these headphones for more almost 2 years now. I am no audiophile but I can hear my 128 kbps mp3 files far better on these headphones as compared to my Creative I-Trigue L3800 (2.1) speakers. And by ""light user"" I mean AT LEAST one hour of use everyday. Because these perform better than my desktop speakers I have them plugged in pretty much all the time. The extra long, single-sided cord is useful even for home use (though its really a lot sometimes!). And I dont need to set my mp3 player volume greater than 25% of max (iAudio X5) to get excellent sound.Yes I agree they are not built that solid. Even though mine are in great condition, you can still feel its mostly plastic. But I have traveled with these headphones and I have also fallen asleep wearing them. I have also experienced no problems whatsoever with the ear cups/padding. Maybe I just got lucky!",5
"I have been using this product for about 6 years now, i both the first pair in 2005, and still used it until last year when one of the cups, died on me. I tried a bunch of headphones but after analyzing the price and what they offer overall i decided to buy another pair of Sony's MDR-V700DJ. they have not hailed me in in all this years, swivels are great sound is amazing, it is all a matter of taste, and sound and as a professional dj this is my choice, i would recommend it to anybody.At the time i have both this, it came packed in the original package and on time.",5
"Great bass... very comfortable even after hours and hours of listening. I use them for my studio work. Sound is completely isolated when they're on your head or cupped together, so there's very little bleed. They are a little tight, so if you have a fat head, these might not be for you. They look great, but handle them with a bit of care, since they are plastic and seem a little prone to breaking due to the many moving parts.",5
"I just purchased the Sonys and I'm excited to share the experience. First, I've owned several different headphones in past, the last being the Sony MDR-V6. I thought it would be impossible to improve on them...but Sony has done it.Comfort: The 700s are all-day comfortable. The earcups fit AROUND your ears, so there is no annoying pressure there. The headband is nicely padded too, so you simply forget you're wearing anything at all. They are 'hefty' and robustly constructed, yet that weight simply disappears once you put them on. They're attractively designed, too...with a professional style.Sound quality: Like I said earlier, Sony has worked magic here. The resolution and detailing these phones provide will have you hearing things ""for the first time""...you'll hear things in music you never knew existed. I am pulling things out of my collection and literally enjoying them for the first time. The bass extension is phenomenal...a concert bass drum-smack or pipe organ will have you giggling like a kid! But they don't stop there...the mids and highs are equally well-produced.The phones are fairly sensitive too...my small headphone amp drives them quite nicely to db levels that doctors would tell you ""no-no!!"" But they sound so good...you wanna keep cranking the volume!Sony thoughtfully provided a nice long cord, too...it's coiled so it doesn't get in the way.Oh, my...the kickdrum in Led Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks"" just about blew my eyeglasses off! Yeehaw!!Buy them...you will not regret it!",5
"I just bought my second pair.  It looks like the build quality is about the same as it was before.  I am a DJ who loves music, and use these for all my work, and these have awesome sound.  There are a few problems with them, however.  If you're a DJ who monitors loudly, and you forget to turn them down after mixing, the drivers can and will eventually blow!  In addition, the round plastic cylinders with the L and R labels at the top of them break, and that is why I finally had to buy a new pair, but not bad for 5 years of use and abuse!Sound quality wise, if you're not a DJ there are better headphones out there.  If money is no object, get the Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones, much better, and filters out all the sound around you!  But if you're a DJ, these headphones are a MUST!!!! I've talked to hundreds of other DJ's, and they all have bought the Denons, Technics, Pioneer, and other brands of DJ headphones that cost the same or more, and they have all told me that those headphones DO NOT HOLD UP as good as the Sony's did.  Too bad the DJ headphone makers don't take note of this and make a better quality product.",4
"I will keep it simple folks! I bought them, I tried them, I love 'em! Very versatile so far! I'm no sound expert, but I know what I like! And these Sony's are great! I also plan to try the Beyerdynamics 770Ts with 250 ohms and compare sound quality and comfort! Shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival! Thanks again Amazon!",5
"I DJ all the time and I needed something that I felt would not steer me wrong. So these are the headphones that were recomended to me from a friend who is a dj also. I can turn and fold in about any direction you think of, and gives you a great quality of sound at the same time. I dont think I'd be able to get the same satifaction with any other headphones. I mean, what else can I ask for?!",5
"quality...feel...sound..etc...all great...you'll pay a little more...but well worth it.....i hope they last!!  the sound quality, as well as the durability make this product a hit!!!",5
"I'm not exactly a headphone connoisseur but I can tell you that these headphones have impressive sound. I upgraded from the standard issue ipod earbuds. The bass on these things is quite strong (its actually rather painful at anything too high). However, if you read the reviews for these things you will find that the common theme is that they break around the swivel thing. I was determined to be the dude who takes good care of his headphones and doesn't break them. NOT SO. Although these are some of the sexiest phones around, THEY ARE NOT MADE TO LAST. The plastic on the hinge/swivel device is completely inadequate for its purpose. Mine lasted only about a month. The sound still sounds fine, but the swivels are in shambles. DONT BUY THESE IF YOU WANT THEM FOR LONGER THAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. FOR THE PRICE, THE LONGEVITY OF THESE IS A SHAME.",2
"I've had my headphones for 3 years.  I'm an amature DJ and could only recommend these for DJ use.1st of all, the major complaint about these headphones are the cracks that appear on the swiveling brace.  Face it, it's plastic and it can break.  And it's not the best design for durability.  But it's not gonna happen to everybody.  As a matter of fact, a lot of record stores with turntable sampling stations will have these headphones out for use.  A local record shop in HB had about a dozen of these headphones out for years of careless use.  I think, most people end up sitting on or packing them in heavy luggage.  I can't see how you can just put these on top of your head and break them.2nd, they're not designed for audiophile sound quality at moderate volumes.  They're designed to monitor the next song while listening to blaring 15"" club speakers.  A device with mediocre output voltage will not move these 50mm drivers well enough to get good sound quality.  So stay away from iPods.  They're just not gonna drive these headphones really well.  Imagine hooking up two 12"" subwoofers to your car and trying to power them with your headunit.  It's not gonna happen.  Like I said, these are specifically designed for DJ's.  I use a Vestax PMC-05Pro2 mixer and I get crisp, studio monitor quality sound.  Very transparent and smooth lows.3rd, as for the 50mm drivers.. these headphones are designed for accurate and distortion free playback at loud volumes assuming you have a clear and strong output.  There are other headphones out there that have 50mm drivers that are designed for moderate volume levels.  A lot of it is going to depend on the sensitivity of the drivers.  Usually, lower sensitivity will handle louder volume levels better but a higher sensitivity unit will sound more accurate at lower levels.  So if you're not using headphones to monitor songs at a concert or at a club, go and spend your money on something else.",5
"Update:[ June 2011]After the swivel joints broke back in 2000 (around three years of use), I was able to easily put them back using super glue. Since then, I have purchased and used other headphones but still occasionally use the v700 headphones. It's definitely very worn out--the (replaceable) padding is cracked and the fit feels a bit loose--but, they still sound great and the joints have not broken off again. Yeah, after it was literally broken-in, they prove to stand strong with some glue on the joints--I've DJ'd with them, slept with them, and dropped them and I am  still using them with joy. It's been with me for over ten years! I got it a few years after I graduated from college (DJ'd with them) and now I am almost 40 with 2 kids and, I still use them! Amazing. Now, I will use them with care.{Original ""review"" from 2004]When I first purchased these headphones back in 1998,I would have given these earphones 5 stars. But after around 3 years of use, the swivels broke. The swivels are made of plastic, so the first place that falls apart is the swivel joint that connects to the cups. Both left and right joints are cracking after approximately three years of moderate use. Luckily, it is still functional even with the cracks. The problem is that it is now a bit looser so it falls off from my head even more frequently. And we all know that these earphones (including the v600) are notorious when it comes to the deterioration of the padding on the ear cups. I just wish that it would last just a bit longer. I have been looking to replace these and I found the new pioneer hdj-1000 to be a possibility. It sounds just as good, it is definitely lighter and stays on the head steadier; and even though the construction is similar in that it is plastic, the swivel joints are built differenly from the V700DJs which makes me think they knew about this SONY's problem and they have found a way to prevent the joints from cracking.",5
"I brought these headphones for my son. He wanted a DJ type headphone. I compare it to my Denon AHD 1001S. The Sony sound presentation was ""GOOD"", however I was not engaged with the music and recording like with the Denon. The Sony does produce an accurate sound presentation. The sound didn't have a heavy colored bass or treble (Neutral). The Sony may not be an audiophile headphone, definitely it is a great studio monitor DJ headphone.",3
"I just purchased my second pair after neglecting to maintain my old pair. The old ones still sound GREAT, but unfortunately I didn't bother to maintain the leather part of the headphones well, so they started cracking, and after dropping them, one of the swivels stopped working, so they didn't stay on right.With minimal precautions, you too can make these last for years and years - just apply some leather protector once in a while, and take care not to drop the things carelessly on the floor. These things are the best headphones I've ever owned, and it was well worth another $100 to purchase a second pair. The first pair served me well, and actually sound great still - they're just not comfortable, due in NO part to the quality of the headphones themselves.They are solid, and it's nice to have a cord on only one side. It really gets in your way a lot less than the typical headphone design with a cord on each side.Highly recommend these even for those of you who aren't DJs. These are perfect for drowning out the sound of my coworkers at my desk. I can't hear A THING, and people are always waving their arms at me to get my attention.These have an amazing level of bass, better than any I have heard in any headphones before. It's an experience, these are.",5
I tested this in Sony showroom and even in the noisy atmosphere the sound quality was too good with big noise reduction due to the closed cups.  So I ordered one for myself and one for my friend.  The products arrived in good condition.I started testing it with many of my audio and video collections both from my laptop and MP3 player and the sound quality was top notch.  Like many other reviewers I too heard several new sounds from the same old songs!!  The bass is excellent and at the same time high end instruments are also heard very clearly.  Excellent purchase for the pricing (about $84 from Amazon) with free shipping except for the below issue.But then I found an issue with my head set and my friend's one too has the same problem.  It is the clicking noise which I can clearly hear in my ears when the cup moves if I move my jaw or my ears involuntarily.  And many times I hear that even when I move my head but not all the times.  This is fine during music but too annoying to me during movies.  I have a good sized head (!) and there is no play when the headphone sits on my head.  It is having a very good fit.Haven't seen others writing about this.  Can anyone share their opinion?  Mine are just 5 days old and I am worried if this will increase over period of time.,4
"Really good set of cans...very good overall...all genres.  These things need power to perform at there best, amp hungry.  They are not my Ultrasone PRO 550 or PRO 750...but they make an awesome set for a family set headphone.",4
"I just want to echo what a lot of reviewers have said...The sound is absolutely first rate!  Music no longer feels like it's around you, you're part of it.  Bass sounds absolutely crisp and clean, not muddled and washed out like some other headphones I've used.  Highs and midtones are well represented.  Pretty much perfect for any sort of music, be it electronic, rock, or classical.  I used to game with these headphones on my PC as well, which completely spoiled me.But like others have said, wear and tear seem to plague this pair of headphones.  I don't DJ, but I do use my headphones on a regular basis and my first pair eventually formed cracks near one of the earpiece joints which was the beginning of the end.  My second pair's demise was my own fault, having fallen asleep with them on and somehow twisting them in just the appropriate direction to break off a joint.Other than the joints, however, I'm pretty happy with the ear pads.  Given the amount of wear, the pads have held up quite well, where other cheaper headphones have eventually fallen apart due to heat and perspiration.Comfort-wise, I'd rate them a 4 out of 5.  They feel pretty much like what they look like.  Part of the great sound is because they pretty much cup your head pretty snugly and feel pretty comfortable for the first several hours.  However, after an extended period, your ears are ready for a break from being mashed to your head.  I don't rate them too badly on this, mainly because there are other similar-looking headphones which are pure orture compared to the Sonys.If you're looking for comfort, I would suggest the Bose Triport headphones which sells in a similar range or the more expensive Quiet Comfort 2 (which adds Noise Cancelling).  Although I can't speak for wear'n tear, I've tried out the Triports at my friends place and I currently own a pair of QC2 (mainly because I needed noise cancellation for work-related reasons), and these two pairs of headphones are unmatched for comfort.HOWEVER, for pure sound, I preferred the Sony's by far.  I'll probably pick up another pair of these Sony's soon, because writing about them make me miss them.So my bottom line?PROs:1) Sound - my favorite sounding pair to date by far!2) Portability - they fold up nicely and come with a travel pouch3) Comfort - reasonably comfortable for extended periods4) Durable Ear Pads5) Sound6) Sound7) Sound8) Sound9) Sound10) SoundCONs:1) Quick wear'n tear on the plastic joints, so careful with twisting the earpieces too much2) High price for such fragilityFor such an pricy pair, Sony should have constructed these headphones better, but at least for me, the sound is definitely worth it.",4
"This review is to address the issue of these headphones breaking, and only that, because quite frankly I could go on for days about how well these headphones work for DJing and everyday listening.  Stuff breaks, this is a fact of life.  Cars break, dishes break, and even people break, these headphones are no different.  Expecting them to last a lifetime because of the pricetag is simply naive.  There's also a difference between breaking beyond function and a simple annoying break like the plastic cracking.  These headphones will surely enough one day die completely as in loss of function, but up to that point they will begin to fall apart.  The swivel housings are the most common thing to break but from reading the reviews here on Amazon it is as if people have never heard of Duct Tape or they are so appalled by the idea of $100+ headphones breaking that they refuse to do anything but complain about it.  The Pioneer HDJ1000s break, the Senheisers break, and if you can find me headphones that don't break then I applaud your discovery of solid titanium headsets that don't exist.This all boils down to one thing and one thing only, how well do you treat your possesions?  If you're like me and you don't mangle everything you own then a $80-$150 pair of headphones is a safe investment, because it will last.  If you just play wild shows all the time, wear these skating/snowboarding, throw them in your backpack, or whatever then you're a moron to buy them and expect them to not break.  Nowhere in the description of this product does it say these things are as solid as a tank.  It states that they're flexible (they are), have a good bass range (they do), and they're comfortable (they are for me but that's a personal thing).Don't be deterred by reviews saying these things break, because everything does and every comparable set of headphones is equally flawed.  The HDJ1000s get loose sliding fixtures really quick, the Senheiser 280s sound overall better but they feel like a plastic toy and really aren't much better.  If you're a DJ your options are the V700s and HDJ1000s, there's a reason they're the industry standards.  They are time tested and proven.  If you aren't willing to buy a few good pairs of headphones then DJing is NOT the hobby for you because you WILL break your stuff MANY times, not just your headphones.Well there's my rant, these headphones do EXACTLY what they say they do and for that I give them a 5/5.",5
"These will break on you, very quickly - believe me - I'm a DJ that's given up and decided to go to the 280's!  What happens is that in a short period and even after taken care of these, the swivel cups/plastic thing will crack and break and the cups will no longer fit closely to your head....they will then be useless and since this usually happens shortly after a year you will no longer have your mfr's warranty!Countless other DJ's will tell you the same thing, save your money and get something better -- the HD 280's sound better, fit better, and give you more value for your money.  They are cheaper and parts are easily available and easily replaceable....unlike Sony's 700's.  Do the right thing, don't buy these! You'll be happy you listened to my advice!",2
"First off I'd like to say that these headphones are very nice quality. I'm not an audiophile but I do have a pair of headphones on during most of the day. Playing computer games (WoW, COD, Fallout, etc) and listening to music, watching videos I prob average wearing these headphones for about 4-5 hours a day. My beef is they are not comfortable wearing beyond a 1 hour duration. The combination of having the ear padding too soft/short and the pressure that they put on each ear I have to take them off after because of the pain they produce wearing for long periods of time. I still use them on a daily basis, mostly because they were so expensive to buy in the first place I can't just set them off to the side and use something else. But after using these for a few months I might have to second hand sell them and look for something else that's more comfortable. To your average user these will be a good set of headphones, but to the guy like me who wears headphones for most of the day, I'd suggest looking for a more comfortable set of headphones.",3
"I wanted to refute what I've read on here about these being for DJ use. I couldn't disagree more. I hate dance, rap and anyting to do with a club or DJ. These phones are excellent for rock or anything i've tested them on. Tried out Hendrix, Floyd, Zeppelin, Metallica, Megadeth, Marley, Janes Addiction, Maiden and more and I have absolutely no complaints. I can maybe notice a little about the mids being overpowered in a few spots but the base and highs sound so freakin' good it blows me away. I cannot compare the 7506's but may have purchased those if I had done more research first. You really can't go wrong with these. I can't speak for the durability but after reading the reviews I will not fold them up and plan on using them at home 95% of the time. The sound quality of these is astounding. Don't believe the negative rants....",5
"i've been buying these for over 10 years now.  this is my third pair.  no, they are not crappy.  i traveled to less than favorable places under less than favorable conditions and beat the ever living crap out of them.  a product can only make it so far.  i don't baby my stuff.  having said all that, i have no regrets.  i love these, they are so loud you can set them on the table in a room and still hear them on full blast.  i will continue to buy this headset even when the next ones break.  LOVE THESE",5
"I love these headphones, as well as the MDR-V600 headphones.  I believe the oil from your skin over time will cause the coating to slough off of the earphone padding skin.  However, since hygiene is of utmost importance, especially if more than one person is using the headphones, I have purchased some sanitary headphone covers.  This not only keeps the headphones clean, it also makes the headphone ear pads last forever.  Just an idea, but try using sanitary headphone covers on ALL your headphones.  I believe you can buy a bag of 100 on-line for about $18.00.  It's definitely worth protecting these wonderful headphones.  I use them in my home studio, and the frequency response is excellent, and I can hear every note, not to mention the exceptional large drivers (50-mm) that the headphones contain.",5
"No the Sony MDR-V600 does not compare to the Sony MDR7506 model at all. In fact the V600 model has much more quality sounding bass, much smoother sounding mid range, and a higher high end.In fact the Sony MDR7506 headphones are very flat sounding and I suppose they are made only for studio monitoring and recording and mastering. But I am sure the MDR7506 are not good for either purpose. Just look at the frequency response specs and they will tell you the real difference between the two of these headphones. One is for music and the other I am not sure what they are good for ? I own the MDR7506 and they sound completely flat and dull, completely lifeless.These headphones are comfortable but can get hot in the summer, its pleather and not real leather. I suppose if you are real handy you can make real leather ear pads for this and sell them too online ? Anyone here listening ?You can replace the ear pads when they wear out. But do not buy the eBay replacement ear pads, they do not fit right and easily slip off. Not even the same quality as the original Sony ear pads. I suggest getting them from Sony instead.I use to use these Sony MDR-V600 headphones for listening to all music, studio mixing, and for recording vocals etc. But now I prefer exclusively the JVC HARX700 headphones instead, they are the most accurate and perfect sounding headphones I have ever heard. The JVC HARX700 blows away anything Sony produces at any price, the quality of the build is excellent, and are more comfortable, and at 1/8 the price of these Sony headphones.",3
"I used to have these along time ago.  When I first got them, they were better than my other headphones I used to own.  These headphones have some serious bass and treble, and DJ's still use these headphones.  They are great for part 15 broadcasting, and hosting holiday parties when queing up a song.  They are good for remixing, shuffling music, and running a small FM or AM station.  Also these headphones are good for the shortwave radio listener and ham radio operator.  They are the best!  I hope I can get another pair soon.",5
"I've had my pair of V600's for at least 7 years and they still sound great.  There is a bit of wear and tear and I take good care of my things.  They were with me on many outings including packing them accross europe and they have held up.  the thin black stuff has peeled off a bit, but it does not affect sound quality or comfort.so lets see, 7 years at $70.  At $10 a year, I am very happy with this purchase.EDIT (6/14/11):I still have these though I don't use them very often. Too bulky and the cord is very long. They still sound great though after all these, wow 13+ years! These things are as old as my cat who is now on prescription food for his feline diabetes. In other words, they have held up better than a slightly neglected pet.",5
"Incredible headphones. I'm not an expert on sound like some of the other reviewers, but I love to listen to music. My office can get a bit noisy at times and these headphones do the trick.After a full 8 hours my ears are a little tired from the headphones sitting on them, but I usually don't wear them all day. The ear covers are soft and made from a very comfortable material. The sound is amazing! I think I can hear more music through these headphones than I do my stereo system at home.Cable has two adapters to fit most sized jacks. It is long enough to plug into my PC and still give me room to work comfortably and move around from phone to filing cabinet and back to PC with no troubles.Great buy, I am really impressed with these headphones. Highly recommended.",5
Wonderful wearing this headphone for long period of time ( I used it for more than two hrs most of the time).  Clear and has great bass when turned up volume.  Highly recommend this item.,5
"Although they come nowhere near the calibre of high-end Sennheiser headphones, the MDRv600s perform admirably for the amount of money they cost.  The highs are crystal clear, the mids unmuddy, and the bass is pretty good (although I personally found it a bit underpowered, which is why these receive only four stars, and not five).  Perhaps more importantly, these headphones are extraordinarily comfortable and fit snugly around your ears, making them ideal for home use and extended listening (unlike the v700s, which are designed to be used during live DJ performances, and therefore be worn mostly over only one ear).If you're an average home user looking for a great set of headphones to listen to your mp3 collection or your big, booming new DVDs with, these are the ones for you.",4
"This is my second pair of headphones. There is absolutely NO comparison with the first, because this one has to be approximately 284x better. The bass, like everyone said, is crisp and clear, but not exactly booming with the lows. In other words, it's not the same as car subs. The sound quality, however, is absolutely incredible. I'm able to hear certain noises in music and gaming that I haven't ever heard from my speakers.The headphones aren't technically noise cancellation, but I can't hear a single thing anyone is saying when they're standing next to me. I don't even have the noise that loud!There are a couple complaints I have about this product, but they are minor. First, the design of the headphones are shaped to fit ones ears. Because of that, it isn't possible to wear them the other way. Luckily, the cord is very long and coils up so it won't tangle up. The second complaint I have is that my ears become extremely hot and uncomfortable after just 30 minutes or so. To combat that, I just take them off for a good 10 seconds and it's fine again. It does get annoying though.I'm no audiophile so I can't judge the quality in comparison to other headphones, but I would MOST CERTAINLY buy this product again.",5
"I first bought the Sony MDR V6 over a decade ago and was so taken by their performance, that I invested in the V600 a few months ago. I have not been disappointed. If you are looking to combine your digital music listening experience (CDs, MP3s, etc) with a top notch pair of headphones or looking to enhance your movie watching experience (on a laptop for example) with a state of the art pair of headphones, look no further.The highs and the lows are captured perfectly, adding a hithero unknown dimension to your listening (and viewing) pleasure. You certainly cannot go wrong with the price either!Be warned, however, that these headphones are heavy. While, not a problem, should you be sitting in one place and listening to the audio, by no means will you be comfortable walking around in these headphones. (Hence the four and not five stars.)",4
"I have been in the entertainment industry for thirty five plus years .. Watching to pros around me use these headphones must have stuck in my head .. I just started a new business, needed headphones and the MDRV600s became the obvious choice .. They are comfortable to wear - Have a long cable and seem to reproduce a fine spectrum of natural sound .. I love these things .. I just wonder why I waited this long .. I should have had these to listen to my music a long while ago - There great!",5
"After owning these headphones for over 6 months I can tell you that they just don't compare at all to the Sony MDR-V6 model. The overall sound quality is muddy, flat, and lifeless. The bass tone these cans produce is more of an upper mid-bass rather than a smooth, tight, and deep bass. The mid-range sounds are muddy and offer very little ambient presence to the sound. Highs are more harsh sounding rather than clean and precise. If you're buying these mainly to listen to music I'd suggest you look elsewhere as these sound pretty bad. I currently use the Sony V6s (not the V600s) for listening to music and some studio work and the difference between them is quite dramatic.The build quality and comfort of the Sony MDR-V600 is about all that is good about them. But, if you want something that sounds accurate for studio monitoring than get the classic Sony MDR-V6 model (many studios and radio stations use the Sony MDR-V6 or the Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring sound). They fold up just like the MDR-V600s and are just as comfortable.If sound quality is important to you then avoid the Sony MDR-V600 headphones like the plague. They're horrible.",1
"While shopping for new headphones I just realized I bought this item as a kid--13 years ago (Thanks Amazon for reminding me when I've bought something)!I'm not an audiophile so I wouldn't be able to elaborate on the specifics of sound acoustics but I can tell you this: I've had loud neighbors in the past and these headphones were able to block them out. I've never had any complaints about the quality of the music playing through this. Listening to music with this is quite superb; the bass, mid-range and highs are all equally there.As for the build quality, these have definitely stood the test of time. The original fabric-like material that was surrounding the earpieces and headband have cracked and worn away--this DOES NOT affect sound quality. In fact, I think the extra material is on there to make it easy to clean when the headphones get dirty. The cord looks like the day I got it, the printing on the plastic has not worn away.The only minor issue (and this is mainly because I've read about it from others), is creaking sound when turning your head. The cause of this is the plastic twisting and bending. Again, I never really noticed it until others pointed it out.I haven't had to replace these for 13 years so gather what you will from that statement. I do not *need* new headphones, but I am window shopping should these ever break (and I hope they don't!). I originally bought these for $90 so I'm not sure why it's now $200+. If you can get them at a good rate I do recommend these fantastic headphones!",5
These ear phones are very comfortable and the sound quality is really good too.,5
I have had these for a long time. Excellent product. Recently my wife was telling me that I had black dandruff and would knock a few very small pieces of some kind of black material from the side of my face. It took 2 months to realize that the specs were coming from the headphone covers. They were slowly deteriorating.The good news is that there are replacement covers for just a few bucks. Should be here tomorrow.Update: Received the new covers and while it was a job putting them on I prevailed. The headphones look brand new.Still rate them as a 5.BillCape Cod,5
"Based on people's descriptions, I would guess that about half of these reviews were meant for the MDR-V6. The MDR-V6 is the one that is comparable to the mdr-7506, NOT the v600. If you are not familiar with the MDR line, I can understand how easy it is to confuse the model numbers. I own the V6 and my brother owns the MDR-7506 and i have directly compared these and found that are identical physically from what I can tell aesthetically and both have near identical sound. The MDR-V600 can be described as the black sheep in the family, since it looks, feels, and sounds very different than its more accomplished siblings.The MDR-v600 is much bigger and bulkier than both the V6 and the mdr-7502. While it uses similar drivers, It has a huge earcup and large foam paddings that color the sound. Most noticeable is overbearing amount of bass this thing gives out, which drowns out the mids. This would account for some of muddiness that other reviewers have described. So how this headphone got to be called studio monitors is beyond me. This headphone is more like a pair of v6 that was modified to meet the mainstream demands of bassheads. Whereas v6 was half metal/half plastic, the v600 is all plastic. On the plus side, the huge earcups do help isolate sound a little better than the V6/7502.If you want accurate sound that you can actually use as monitors, stick with the tried and true Sony models such as the v6 or 7502. Since the late 80's, these were among the most widely used monitor headphones in the TV and radio industry.",3
"My first pair lasted 16 years. Somewhere along the line, Sony decided to make the plastic film covering the ear pads thinner, that they would wear out after a year or so and need replacing. Most of their headphones are designed this way. After a few months, the ear pads come apart at the seams. Within a year, bits of black plastic will begin to tear off and stick to your face. Within two years, the ear pads will be completely shredded.These are low-quality, overpriced headphones. You will do better with other brands.",2
"I have had 2 pairs of these and they are the best.  Awesome sound reproduction. Very ""true"" reproduction for those of us who scoff at the BASS BOOST buttons.  I used both primarily for live sound mixing. But after these it is hard to use anything else in you MP3 player.  The size adjustment keeps them comfortable. The flip earphone allows you to hold it up to your ear for a quick listen.The first pair was a travel pair and went on plane flights, car rides, remote shows. After excessive abuse, one of the ear phone joints broke.  I repaired it once and that lasted about 1 year.The second pair sits on the Board at our church.  They have been there for years. The ear phone foam is starting to flake off onto those of us with facial hair.",5
"I've had these headphones for a couple of years now. They sound great and are VERY comfortable, with a silky-smooth earcup lining that means you can wear them for hours.UNFORTUNATELY, that same, comfortable lining soon began to crack, and is now flaking off in pieces about the size of a dime. The headphones still sound good, are still comfortable, but quite a bit of thin, black plastic came off before I noticed the problem. Walking around with stuff like that stuck to the side of your head is not a fashion statement.Is is not sun-induced, as I use them only indoors. I think it may be some kind of fatigue from putting them on and taking them off. So far, it's only happened to the right earcup. The left remains intact.Maybe I just have very caustic skin oils, on one side of my head? I think not.I really liked these headphones soon after I bought them, but now that this has happened I just can't recommend them.",3
My headphones are a bit worse for wear (my fault) but these are my go-to headphones when I really want to enjoy a piece. Good frequency response high and low. Very comfortable even with all-day use.,5
"I just use this for my amplifier on guitars and ukuleles.  guess what...it's ideal.  Comfortable, quiet for others, true sounds reproduction.  I've worn it for, oh, maybe an hour straight, and it's big enough to be comfortable on my ears. It has no funny hissing or such.I am not a earphone guru like some of these reviewers.  Sometimes too much tech knowledge can be a hindrance to good judgement  I, personalty, just wanted a middle priced quality headphone specifically for my amplifier for my high end guitars and ukuleles.  This is wonderful.  Love it.  Wish I could kiss it.  I think I will.",5
"Every night, I listen to a CD (Holosync by Centerpointe) while going to sleep.  The CD has a range of frequencies, from deep bass (down to as low as 20 Hz) to mid-range.  Also, since I travel frequently, the headphones need to be sturdy.When my previous headphones (by Sennheiser) died, I purchased these to use for the CD instead.From an audio quality standpoint, with my old Sennheiser headphones, I could hear some subtle nuances in the audio, at slightly lower volume, than I can with these headphones.  Then again, the Sennheiser headphones cost $250, while these cost $70.However, my Sony headphones serve me very well.  They produce good (but not great) sound, so I can clearly hear the bass and mid-range without turning up the volume.  Because the ear cups are soft and comfortable, the top is padded, and the headphones themselves are lightweight, I can easily fall sleep with the headphones on.The coiled cord is extremely handy, keeping the headphones from becoming too tangled.Beyond that, the headphones themselves are sturdy, standing up to a year of being put in a squished suitcase without a scratch.  Also, they are very affordable (about $70 from Amazon.com).The only issue is, if I wanted headphones to use while working out, these headphones wouldn't do because the padding would likely absorb my sweat.  However, for my non-workout needs, these are excellent.Although the audio isn't quite professional quality, these are an excellent set of headphones for the money.",5
"I use these at work when I'm busy and need to concentrate.  I work in a cubicle with people who like to laugh and joke LOUDLY.  That's great, except when I have a deadline.  I put these on and listen to a CD or the radio, and it shuts out the noise to the point where I can actually get some work done.  I think the sound quality is great.  The coiled cord is about 5 feet long or so and stretches out nicely.  Sony's page says the cord is 9.8 feet long, extended.  It allows me to move about a small area in my cubicle without it getting tangled.  They are the only headphones I've been able to wear all day long without hurting my head.  I'd buy them again, especially at this price.",5
"I used to think these are good but as I realized it was more a placebo thing because 1) I used to think Sony makes the best electronics so it would naturally include headphones 2) I was ignorant in the world of headphones.  Do your research, Sony is not even close to being in par with the best headphones manufacturers like Sennheiser, Grado, and AKG.  These brands are, in my opinion, the best in the business.  After listening to jazz with my AKG 702 and switching over to the Sony, I feel like just throwing this piece of garbage on the wall like really hard.  The sound coming from it sucks so bad in comparison with my AKG.  Don't believe me?  Read all the bad reviews in any review web site, not just this site, and you will hear the same thing: muddy.  Sony headphones sound muddy.  I own 3 Sony headphones and they all have the same characteristics: loud, muddy, and bassy.  Now 1 and 3 are not bad qualities, but 2 is just unacceptable for anyone looking for good sound.  Now these will for sure sound better than really cheap portable headphones or your ipod buds, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are any good.",2
"I think these are great headphones. I have tried the Sony MDR-V6s (bought a pair and gave them away... couldn't stand them), some expensive Shure in-ear headphones (I felt like my ears were going to bleed after wearing them), and some Sony MDR-7506s.In the end, the V600s work the best for me (so far). They have great sound reproduction, I can wear them for hours at a time (and I'm super sensitive... I could wear the V6s for about 1 hour a day before I had to take them off), and they are a great value. The plastics used in their construction seem to be good quality, and they are aesthetically pleasing (not incredibly so, but they are certainly not ugly).",5
"I asked an engineer that has done a ton of work w/ Dj Premier & w/ a ton of famous artists in rap & hiphop for a decently priced but still quality headphone back in 2010. He hit me back w/ a link to the MDR-V600 for $83.99 so i bought them. Now i see the price is over double that. I can definitely undertand why. They have a really great sound quality even at the 200 dollar price tag. The highs are crisp and the bass hits deep. I've used them soley for the past 3 years and wear them sometimes for up to 8 hours w/ very little discomfort & obviously taking breaks throughout. They are also extremely durable and made w/ heavy duty plastic, cordage & parts and can definitely take some hits and drops. The cord is also long enough to provided a great distance to move around and access other equipment around the studio. Considering how much i paid for them they were definitely a steal, but regardless they are some headphones i'll probably use for atleast 2 or 3 more years. I can certainly say these are some of the best headphones i've ever owned. Overall comfort, durability & superb sound quality made these the perfect pair for me.",5
"The headphone cup that goes around your ear is nice for the plane because it eliminates much of the ambient noise that causes jet-lag lethargy, but if you want a better audio experience buy the Sony MDR V700 headphones. They are a little less cuppy on your ear, but the sound is far superior.",4
"These headphones are terrific. I use them all the time for listening to music and watching movies. I have had them for a few years now, and they still work just as good as the day i bought them. They have a nice long  cord, so you don't have to sit close to your receiver or dvd player. If you  are looking for a set of headphones, these are one of the best for its  price range.",5
"I bought the Sony MDR-V600 headphones about 3 seasons ago, and have loved them ever since. I bought them refurbished from Amazon.com at the time, and paid $70 for them (including shipping). Mind you, those were used, refurbished headphones, but they and their packaging looked like new and performed (and still perform) like new. I am baffled to see them being sold for $200 on Amazon now, even though their traditionally more expensive and higher quality siblings (the MDR-V6 and MDR7506) are offered for $130 and $100 less, respectively. If you were planning to spend the stated $200 on the Sony MDR-V600 headphones, do yourself a favor and try the MDR-V6 or MDR7506 instead.With that said, I love my V600s and have never regretted the purchase. The bass is subtle but still obviously present, while the highs can get painfully high when paired with my MacBook Pro (2012 model, which has a good on-board DAC in it). This is reflected in the advertised frequency range of 5-30,000 Hz, and it surprised me since in my experience, Sony headphones traditionally sound a bit heavy on the bass, and muffled. In comparison, these headphones produce super clear sound.Best of all, the V600s are *comfortable*! So much so that I can wear them for hours on end during study sessions and never get tired of wearing them. They work well with my old iPod Video (generation 5.5, 30GB) and different computers, which means the headphones don't use a lot of power.Verdict: if you can find these headphones for $60-70, it is a deal you should never pass up. I thought they sounded better and more accurate than a friend's AKG 702 (which was admittedly more comfortable and durable, but still). Those looking to spend $200 on headphones and are interested in the MDR-V600 should save themselves $100 and get the higher-quality V6 or MDR7506 instead.",5
These are good headphones for the price. They deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum. I was really impressed by both the bass and treble reproduction and response and their ability to envelop my ears diminishing outside sounds. I use these with a Yamaha receiver. They deliver very good sound with this receiver. The receiver can play a factor on how sound and music is reproduced through these headphones. That is something you should consider when choosing any headphones.,5
"These are the official headphones for the Holosync user.  I have used them with some of the new audio 3-d sound that the higher levels of HOLOSYNC use and they were amazing.  The ""knock"" at the door and the ""whisper"" in one ear, on the demo CD, for the sound technology, I think it is called ""AudioPhonics"" made me jump thru the roof - the sound was SO REAL!  I think these headphones are very comfortable - they have the adapters - both small and large - that come with them, you don't have to buy separate ones, and the cord is long, flexible and coiled.  I thought Amazon had a VERY decent price for them, I've seen them at 2x or 3x the price.  No complaints at all - I really like them a lot.",5
"Comfy to wear, sound great, sturdy enough. Wrap around the ears nicely to keep ambient noise at a minimum, keep the good smooth highs and round bass in. About the same as the V6s I had for 20 years, but more comfortable.",4
"I purchased these three years and four months ago, they still sound as good as day one. All sound is crisp and clear.  They are comfortable for many hours. I got them for sixty -six bucks. The ear foam has started to wear out and flake off so I bought replacements, for eight bucks. Hope to get many more years service out of them.",5
"I'm pretty sure that I've had these headphones since 1992. I can't believe they still make the same model (mine look exactly like the model pictured).After fourteen years, the material covering the foam padding is starting to crack, but they still sound great.",5
"I paid like $70 for these. I should have bought a few but I didn't know they price would jump so high. I paid less than half of what they are currently going for on Amazon. They just happen to have a frequency response that my meditation CDs require. So, I bought them for that purpose. They do a great job and they're also high quality headphones. What more could I ask for?",5
"I had this head phone for 12 YEARS now i bought in 2000 when i was single and had cash and was looking for best head phone i could buy. i got in 2000 for $100 bucks thought was alot but has last for 12 years now and still sound as good as any head phone i have had.  my kids have used them too now days, i see these dre beat and other head phones and see people go through them head phone and wonder what they do to them, you pay for head phone that cost that much you would expect them to last! I went through whole decade with these, i saw headphone get smaller and smaller, now getting bigger and bigger. which is funny but i have had this pair and nothing go wrong with them,  can wear all day without problem.  i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding head phones that will last.  i see the price has double since i bought them last, but will being another pair whenever these go out if they ever do!!!",5
"I remember back in the summer of 2004 I was in the Muskegon, Michigan Best Buy and saw these headphones I bought them after hearing other headphones that were more expensive but went ahead and bought these because they looked durable and I've been satisfied with Sony's bookshelf speakers and figured that their headphones would sound even better. They were the first pair of V600s I've had. I thought the bass and vocals sounded really good but the treble was a little too thin and inaccurate in my opinion. They were still great headphones and I thought I couldn't find anything much better for the price or so it seemed back then. Then a couple of months later I was on vacation in New York  and accidently left these at a hotel and was disappointed that I lost these headphones. I went until January without decent headphones and then bought another pair of Sony V600s in Holland,Michigan but when I opened them at home I was disappointed that they weren't really the same. The cord was too thin compared to my original pair that was heavy duty and thicker. I had them for about 4 years until I got a cat and she chewed the wire right apart.I was pretty ticked off and gave up on this particular model of headphone and decided to save my money for the professional Sony MDR 7506 which I reasearced on different sites that said were  very durable and rugged headphones so I went ahead and bought those. I am a lot happier with the 7506 not just for their durability and thick cord but I also thought and still think they sound twice as good as the V600s (the treble sounds a lot better on the 7506s) for about 20 to 30 $ more and are a better pair.I keep a better eye on my cat and she hasn't even messed with my cords anymore.The V600s are decent headphones but the thin cord makes it so I just can't recommend them to anyone who owns a pet or little kids.",3
"i had to return these after one day because they were huge on the ears. there was no way to adjust the headband, so it kept falling off my head. i got irritated so i just returned it.sound quality was pretty good, but i didnt have them long enough to say anything else about this.",4
"These are the best headphones u can buy.  I got them, put them on on the way home and couldnt believe how amazing the sound is!!!  I have had nearly every headphone, been searching for the ""perfect"" headphone and i just found it!!!  They look really cool, use only a trickle of power for mp3 players, and give u great sound that covers youre ear unlike earbud or anything like that.  With these you get very very clear distinguishable sound from headphones that are light as a penny.  They are as comfortable as wearing a hat, and you bearly feel they r even on.  it is definitely worth the [price] compared to [price] headphones that break in a week.  And i get [price] a week so i value money alot!  BUY THESE HEADPHONES!!! they dont distort music, they just give it to you with awesome clarity and precision.  They sound so much better than even my awesome sony speakers!!Edit:I wrote this review many many years ago, and apologize for the awful grammar and spelling.  I still own these headphones, and they still sound great, but after becoming somewhat of an audiophile, I have noticed that these emphasize treble and bass.  They sound very punchy and clear because of this, so 90% of people will love them, however if you want to hear music without any extra bass or treble, you will have to get some more professional oriented headphones from Sennheiser or the very well known Sony models.The headphones are well made, but as with most headphones, the first thing to break down is the ear pads and head pad covering.  After so many years of use, the pleather material has seperated from the inside of the ear cups and head band.  This does not interfere with comfort at all, but they don't look as nice as they did when they were new.  That said, the drivers still work great, and sound quality is what it always was.I lent these headphones to a friend who was a fan of rap and other music (that I don't listen to) and he refused to give them back for 2 weeks, since he liked them so much.  If you don't mind getting headphones that are many many years old but still sound great for most ears, these are a great choice.  Please disregard my previous review, I was just happy to find headphones that sounded decent.",4
"These are good, blocks off all sound so you stay focused, so when I'm in grind mode in the studio I'm in GRIND MODE. Only thing is, if listening on high volume in a tight place, like the car, EVERYONE will hear what your listening to. EVERYONE. Just wish somehow it would stay within the headphones, and you.",5
"I""m just an average guy who likes listening to music.  I also use them for privacy when watching tv in a ""full house"".  I'll let the audiophiles give the specs/high & lows/bass & treble reviews.  I bought these to replace my jbl-610's (see my review of those).  Yes I understand those were bluetooth and these are not.  I really didn't care that they were ""wire only"".  These headphones are VERY comfortable.  The giant earpads engulf your ears.  The leather (or what i'm guessing is leather) is very smooth.  I'm hoping for some durability there but I can't attest to it so early after purchase.  They are big enough that I don't have to extend the ear pads at all.  The headpiece is soft but solid.  No worries there.  I use mine at the desk so the cord is plenty long enough for me.  I haven't had them on a plane so I can't say how they will do on blocking out noise but I'm hopeful..... I'll update on that as it happens.  One last common man observation, and maybe I missed it in Amazon's description, the plug is a standard stereo sized plug but you can unscrew is and underneath is a 3.5mm plug.  Anyway really like them and for the price, you can't go wrong.",5
"These headphones are almost indistinguishable from the Sony 7506 model, which may well be the most popular headphones in American recording studios. I have both. I think the V600s are lighter weight, so a little more comfy for long sessions, or wearing all day in an office or something.The cord attached to only one side is great. The phones &quot;seal up&quot; really well, with a true closed-back design. If you squeeze the cups shut together, you can just barely hear them, even if it's cranked up to bust your eardrums. This, in spite of the fact that they are plastic. You CANNOT hear the outside world when these phones are at normal levels.  When they're cranked up, somebody could be shouting in your face, and you'd think they were lip-syncing.Besides being well-sealed, and loud, these phones give a big, smooth sound that won't give you a headache or have you wondering what you're missing. As another reviewer mentioned, they're very efficient, producing a ton of volume with very little power - and it's volume you can stand, unlike lesser models that will hurt your ears at similar decibel levels.If you're looking for the pro version - it's the 7506, and only available at musical/recording outlets. Here, all you have to do is click that button, and soon you'll be listening to headphones that I'd buy again and again if I lost or destroyed them...",5
"I ordered these after buying several (supposedly decent) pairs (and returning them).I love these. The sound is so clear - they sound great even turned up very loud (they have the capability to go much louder than I could ever stand) Vocals are super clear, while the subtlety of the other instruments and little bell sounds and stuff on the tracks can be heard very well. Nice bass also.I am like ""the princess and the pea"" when it comes to comfort, and THESE  THINGS ARE SUPER COMFORTABLE!! I can hardly feel them. I wear glasses, and other headphones pressed my glasses against my head which hurts, these don't.I don't think they mention it in the product description, but they do cancel alot of ambient noise -- my phone just rang, and I totally did not hear it with these on my head. Soooo.... I highly recommend these.",4
"I have been using these headphones for nearly eight years, and they still sound incredible.  They catch the highest highs and lowest lows, and the construction is built to last.  I use these for DJing and I have hauled these headphones to countless clubs and gigs with nary a problem in all the years I've used them.  I also have a pair at home that sound great no matter what you're plugging them into, be it a stereo, an ipod, or a television set.  For the price, you simply cannot get a better pair of headphones for the price.  Buy with confidence!",5
"I'm not much of an audiophile, and I admit that I initially shuddered at the thought of dropping so much cash on a set of headphones. But then a friend of mine recommended these, said I wouldn't regret it. I'm happy to say that he was right. Watching movies and listening to music became an entirely different experience. Brought out the best in my CDs and DVDs and the worst out of my low-bitrate MP3s. Every little click and hiss became clear as day. Found myself re-encoding a bunch of my old stuff at higher bitrates, but it was worth it. Best of all, they block quite a bit of outside noise. Great for getting some peace and quiet in even the most chaotic of environments.And that's not all. They pack neatly--they fold and fit snugly in the included vinyl pouch, which is surprisingly durable. The headphones themselves have held up pretty well, but then I'm pretty gentle with them. The cord's plenty long and doesn't tangle easily. These little touches make all the difference.If you have more discerning tastes, you may be better served by something else more refined (and likely more expensive). But if you're looking to move up from cheapo $10 headsets, this is as good a place as any to start.",5
Sony headphones deliver great sound no matter if you plug it in a stereo or portable device. I love the crisp sound.,5
"I have used a pair of MDR-V600 headphones to fine-tune critical mixes and do any and all other client audio work for (I think) over a decade.  I have replaced the ear cushions once, which was surprisingly easy to do.  I cannot imagine what reviewers are thinking of when they describe the sound as muddy -- these have served me well as a reference standard for all the work I do.  I have tried several other pairs of high-end cans and I keep coming back to these.  I think I paid twice what you can find them for now, back in the day (I seem to remember a $125 price tag), and seriously contemplate, every few months, shelving a second pair for safekeeping.",5
"Good ""overall"" headphones for the (cost sold here) and for first foray into a better sound from the standard issue.For the price they have a better than usual articulation in the sound but...I bought them at a mall ($100) to get me through a ""quick need"" situation And I expected a little more from Sony. I've had many other cheap & high end ""cans"" as well thus seeing both sides of the spectrum, For my money.Price wise these Sony MDR V600's are pretty decent for someone wanting a quiet (closed-ear) headphone for not too much money ($80 or so). Like all ""cans"" they will sound better after you break them in about 30hrs. or so.I've used/tried these on both my desk/top computer (taking out the speaker jack & plugging these in after unscrewing the 1/4"" jack supplied) & on my ""High End"" Stereo system.Pros: Fit snuggly, adjust well, not too heavy; They work well (for large cans) and loud on a fair/low amount of energy; Decent amount of ""presence"" and spacial deffiniton; They have clear sound that won't show the immperfections of some recordings; A nice touch, one cord feeds both ears/speakers on the left side; Design style folds up small for it's overall size. Nice Length/design to the cord.Cons: A Weak bass response that becomes muddled if pushed (loud) at all. Mid range response is loud yet sounds ""flat"". And highs that sound ""clipped"" and not really distinct.(These comments may be a little harsh for the price range but I'm trying to steer you towards somthing better if you are willing to spend a little more)Anyone really wanting to dramatically improve their lisenting experience, and using/needing headphones on a regualr basis should spend a little more money and buy any sennheiser or a grado product. For the money, these are excellent headphone alternatives for whatever additional amount (more than this) your willing to pay.All in all, not a bad product solid good plastic construction in design, not a stand out (in sound) either.And for the money seemingly average. My advice is to spend a bit more and get somthing that you will really notice the difference in and say wow! Than you will have somthing that will last you for years to come...",3
"I've been in the broadcasting business for over 15 years and these are the best headphones I've ever used.  It took some convincing to invest in them, since I usually bought cheaper headphones.  But the cheap ones last a few months, and the Sony MDR-V6s last years.  You won't be sorry with this headphones!",5
"I am an audio newbie and for me, these sound great. I know that one can always spend more money, but these worked just fine for me, but only for about four years. The left-hand side of the headphones just fell apart. One day, they were working fine, the next they break on me and become unusable, hanging by a single cord. I didn't use these every day, but only on occasion. I would have thought that they'd have lasted me 5-7 years, but I was way off.",4
"From the start had to fiddle with plug to get good sound.At first, I thought it was the computer jack, but as timewent on it got worse and worse. Did some experimentingand determined it was definitely loose wiring in the plug.You spend this kind of money you at least expect it to bemanufactured well. I'm done with Sony. I've had other badexperiences recently, they just aren't what they used to be.",1
"I've owned the V600, the 7506 and the V6's.  I've been happy with all three, though if I had to pick, I'd take the V6s.  And I'm fairly critical when it comes to headphones.  Anyone trying to divine perfection among these three really needs to go audition all of them to see which they prefer.  They differ, but are comfortable, yield high-quality sound, and are well-made.  I wouldn't have a problem recommending any of them.  The differentiators are these: the V6 and 7506 are almost identical (though the 7506s are more expensive), are flatter in response and more suited to studio use.  The V600 is a mass-market headphone well-suited to general listening use with a sound that tends toward warmer and bassier.My current set of V600's is getting pretty tired, and I'll probably audition all three again myself.  To anyone reading reviews to figure out which to buy, my advice is to not over-analyze it - unless you already have a preference, buy whichever is the best deal at the time.  Chances are, you'll be more than happy.  Sony makes superb headphones.",5
"These are not the real deal. They are fakes. The so called 40mm diaphragm don't sound good at all. I've had a real pair of V600s, and they sound 300% better than these.Do not waste your time or money on this product..",1
"I've always gone the cheap route, and purchased $30 headsets that would last for a couple years and develop crackly sounds along the way.  Tiring of that in my middle age, I decided to spring for something a bit better, but first checked with Amazon's reviews.  This led me to the MDR-V600 headset, which was about $80.  Should have done it a long time ago...  Money well spent!  Excellent volume range, comfortable, covers my ears so well that it excludes all outside noise even at moderate output.  I used them mostly for listening to itunes on my computer while I do other things.  Occasionally to practice piano/keyboard.  Like I said, money well spent, although I have only had them a couple months.  Other reviewers give high marks for longevity, so I expect they will be satisfying for me as well.",5
"I use these for dj'ing, and have run them for several years.  The only thing that I had happen, is the thin covering over the earphones, and also on the headband will deteriorate and come off in little pieces.  I finally took some duct tape and used it like a lint roller to pull the remaining covering off because I would come home with little black pieces of material all over my head and clothes.  Since I use them in loud environments, I can't really comment on sound quality.  They do block some sound (a little less now that the covering came off), which helps in loud areas.  The cord is coiled, and long, it has stretched out over time, so it's really long now, just make sure you don't wrap the cord around the phones tightly.",4
"Let me just preface this mini-review by stating that I'm not an audiophile, so in terms of these headphones on a technical level, I can't say much.I can say, however, that I had decided about two years ago that I needed headphones for my computer, and so I went to J&R; Music and Computer World to try ones on.I tried these, and they sounded great to me, again, being a non-audiophile, and they were extremely comfy.Here it is, two years later, and the headphones still work fantastically, are still comfortable, and still sound great.They're not noise cancelling, however if you have loud music playing, odds are you won't be able to hear your roommate shouting at you from behind. In addition, since I can tell the difference between say, a 256kbps MP3 and a lossless version of the same song, I can still notice the same difference on these headphones. Yes, this is a matter of audio compression, but the point I'm trying to infer there is that even the small details of audio compression don't go unnoticed with these headphones.Very highly recommended.",5
"MDR-V6, MDR-7506, MDR-V600, MDR-EX71SL: I own all of these headphones, and I have to say that my 19 year old pair of Sony MDR-V6's, and especially my newer MDR-7506's, blow these MDR-V600's out of the water. While arguably a bit more comfortable for LONG sessions, the MDR-V600's sound thin and cold compared to the MDR-7506's. I gave my MDR-V600's away because I was even more disappointed with them once I bought the MDR-7506's. Kids, save your milk money for another week or two and buy some cans that are audiophile quality - the MDR-7506's. I have had mine for 5 years or so, and just recently replaced the ear-pads with Beyerdynamic velour pads and MAN oh MAN - the sound gets even better and the cans just got WAAAY more comfortable.  Buyer take note - do some reading on the ""can"" web sites and steer yourself towards a better Sony product than the mediocre MDR-V600's. Your ears will thank you, and you'll thank amazon.com for getting the MDR-7506's to you in record time. (NOTE: If you need something lighter and portable and it HAS to be Sony, try the MDR-EX71SL's - they sound decent, but they've had cord quality issues...)",3
I'VE BEEN READING  REVIEWS WHERE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WEARING OUT THESE  PHONES AND BUYING A SECOND PAIR. I BOUGHT A NEW PAIR OF EAR PADS FROM SONY ON LINE FOR LESS THAN $30 INCLUDING S&H AND TAX. JUST AS GOOD AS NEW!,4
"Headphones are highly personal devices, so don't be surprised to see wide variances of opinion.  In fact, I have yet to discover an &quot;all-purpose&quot; pair.  Imagine an equalizer board with 8-16 slider switches adjustable in any number of configurations.  Boost the treble and upper mid-range while cutting back on the bass and you have the Panasonic 850's, which are perfect for concentrating on Ella's voice or Tony Williams' ride cymbal but not on Nelson Riddle's orchestral arrangements or Ray Brown's bass.The Sony MDR-V600's may be as close to a &quot;universal,&quot; accurate set of headphones as you can get for under a hundred and fifty.  Compared to my MDR-6's, which my son &quot;borrowed,&quot; they're more comfortable and the sound is more &quot;flat&quot; (i.e. accurate, faithful, undoctored).  If your tastes extend beyond contemporary pop and you're serious about sound &quot;fidelity,&quot; beware of those &quot;DJ&quot; models, with the bass boost, brain-shaker and virtual-reality features.  And as a previous reviewer has pointed out, this model is identical with the higher-priced &quot;professional&quot; phones Sony is listing as model 7506.  Perhaps Sony plans to make the 700's the only available models (call it &quot;cost-effective marketing), because there are currently some great deals on the MDR-V600's.My only &quot;complaint&quot; is the extreme degree to which the V600's seal off all outside sound, making me feel like I'm trapped in a cocoon (they're ideal for anti-social or solipsist personalities).  These phones are a pleasure now and then, but I'm still happy with my Sennheiser PX-100's for 80% of my listening.",5
I am a freelance camera operator and sometimes I end up having to edit projects.  Since I don't edit often I did not want to spend lots of money on studio headphones but at least wanted something that would cancel out the outside world when I edited and this does just that.  I was so impressed I took it out in the field with me on sets and it's great.  I can't hear anything unless someone talks into the microphone going to the camera which is great.  I love these headphones.,5
The quality of sound on these things is amazing. Good bass and amazing clarity. I am hearing things in my music I've never heard before!,5
"I used a pair of Sony V300 studio monitor headphones for about 2 years until they became unrepairable.  I didn't realize that this was a blessing in disguise.  I purchased the V600 headphones as a replacement since they addressed my greatest complaint with the V300s: ear compression.  I use my headphones daily to listen to music while working in my cubicle.  This amounts to at least 3 hours of use, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year.  That's at least 780 hours of use per year.  I don't need my ears pressed up against my head by ill-fitting headphones.  The V600s have a circum-aural design that encloses all but the largest of ears.  They're comfy and sound super-fantastic.  I love these headphones!",5
"Best Sony product I have purchased lately. My 7 year old has Autism and we bought this for one of his CD sessions. It was recommended by the therapist group and they are very responsive with sound and fit my son just fine, drowning out distracting sounds around him while he is listening to his CDs. I want to get a pair myself!",5
"I first discovered these headphones by using the industrial version, the MDR-7506, for more than 10 years as a professional field video producer. I bought the MDR-V600's for home use, and they look and sound new after 11 years of occasional use at home.These are an over-the-ear headphone, meaning that they fit around the ears without touching them - they sit on your head but not on the ears, which means that your ears don't get sore. This also acoustically isolates you from your environment.  However, if you sweat heavily, they also tend to trap moisture.Sound reproduction is excellent and full-range, and due to the acoustic isolation of the phones, you will hear well and you won't hear much of what's going on around you outside the phones. They do slightly emphasize bass in comparison to other frequencies, but that's something that most people don't mind.The screw-on 1/4"" tip screws off to reveal a 1/8"" stereo plug, so the phones work with most playback devices. I highly recommend them as durable, acoustically excellent workhorses that you will use for many years.",5
"I've had these headphones for at least 8 years. They've been stepped on constantly, thrown around, used for countless gaming/music listening hours, and even had my dog chew on them for a bit. They still work fine.Great sound quality, reliable, durable, and so comfortable you don't know they're on sometimes. 5 stars.",5
"My wife and I have been using a meditation program for over a year (Holosync) and these headphones are recommended by the company to use if you want to enhance the listening experience. We had good results using just earbuds and more advanced listening devices aren't necessary until you get to advanced levels of the program, but we decided we'd give them a try. They were also much cheaper from Amazon than buying from Centerpointe.They really have improved the listening experience. I have some slight hearing loss and these headphones allow me to hear a greater range of sound without having to turn the volume up too high. The headset is very lightweight and comfortable for the bulk of it. The cord is long and dangling and is really too much for an iPod (which of course they're not really made for anyway), but it's easy to reign in when necessary.If you get them, keep in mind that the bigger connector plug can be unscrewed to reveal the more common mini plug.Over all we give them two thumbs up!",5
"There's so much personal taste involved when assessing headphones. There's always a tradeoff to be made in terms of what headphones have what strengths--but even at that, these headphones are pretty disappointing.These headphones have great depth (boomy) but in midranges they lack a lot of detail. The sound is full but very flat. Crispness is really lacking.  If you've heard some higher-end headphones, or are the sort of person that appreciates high-end satellites and tweeters when listening to a conventional speaker setup, you likely will be profoundly disappointed with these headphones.On the plus side, they are very comfortable to wear. They also do a very good job of sealing the sound in, so people nearby won't hear your music if you're wearing these. So they are a very good choice for work if you can put up with the sound quality.Worth serious consideration instead (for a closed/isolating headphone w/DJ functionality) would be the Sony MDR-V6--which are similar in construction but beat the V600 in every way, or the AKG K81DJ, which also produces far superior sound for the same money.  Those are not quite as comfortable as the Sony's--but sure sound better.",2
"I purchased this headphone last December 2007. I went through a number of headphones before getting this headphone. I have used KOSS headphones and Sennheisser headphones. The cheaper 30-40$ earphones I bought would always break down on me. Headband would snap or the quality was just getting very poor. I went to a local music store and decided to take a dive into more expensive headphones.I purchased these headphones without even listening to them. I asked the clerk to recommend a good affordable headphone and he handed me these. I bought them and had my mp3 player in hand to test these out. Immediately when I tried these headphones on it was a world of difference. They feel extremely comfortable and lightweight. The sound is real crisp and clean. These headphones sound beautiful with almost any sort of music. The only thing this headphone lack would be stronger bass. Everything else from mids to highs, it is very nice. I can wear these headphones for 6hrs straight before my ears start hurting. This headphone even comes with a cool leather carrying case.",4
"I gave these headphones a five star rating because the sound is very clear.  You get good separation and a feeling of spatial separation and distance.  They work great. They are comfortable.  It's just too bad I can't use them.I bought these because other reviewers extolled the virtues of these headphones for sealing out the noise of their busy offices.  Any headphone can drown out surrounding noise.  Be warned.  These are not well sealed. The Sony product manual packed with the MDR-V600 headphones cautions customers not to disturb those close by.If you also got the impression that these ""closed"" headphones would allow you to listen privately you will be disappointed.  I work in an office doing data entry.  I like to listen to wild profane and controversial stuff and I don't want people listening in. These headphones would disturb my colleagues if I used them at work.  You can hear them clear and loud even when pressed firmly together.Nobody I work with wants to hear The Sex Pistols sing The Good Ship Venus.  So as good as the MDR-V600's are the little headphones that came with my player are better because I can crank them up and only I can hear them.  Too bad because these are so much more comfortable.Also I should mention I got ""refurbished"" MDR-V600 headphones.  The screws that hold them together do not all match some are silver and some are black.  Then it probably goes without saying that they are made in China not Japan.",5
My oldest son had this model for several years and my other son  or his dog or some imaginary elf hadapparently ruined these beyond repair.......and &#34;Never to be found again&#34; according to the oldest son.  To savebloodshed I hopped on Amazon and found the exact model available and shipped home in a few days!Amazon &#34;IS&#34; the place!,5
"These are the best headphones I've ever owned. I recently purchased a replacement pair, as my original set died after 6 years of intensive use. They were repeatedly abused, shoved in and out of my bag and under seats on airplanes and generally not treated very well. They have stood the test of time and really performed well.I am a designer and I wear headphones all day long at work so comfort is imperative. While these headphones are large, they are extremely comfortable and block out my obnoxious coworkers.While the earpads will wear away in time as they did with my old set, the comfort and quality is not compromised. I have purchased these as gifts for fellow music lovers and twice now for myself. I couldn't recommend them enough.",5
"OK for the price and I like the design and fit so I keep buying them, but they break down quickly. I've been through several.",3
"In the last 15+ years, I tried a number of phone headsets by different manufacturers.  This one was the best --- lightweight, adjustable metal headband (not plastic), extremely comfortable, small unbreakable mic &#34;wand&#34;, easily accessible earpiece volume and mute control, and mic volume control, which is not common for headsets in this price range.  I used the previous headset for years until I moved overseas.  Now I'm back, I am delighted to have another one.",5
Quality of headset is good. Does not have standard 3.5 jack plug as adverstised. Would suggest only as replacement for other Plantronic product and not cross usage.,3
I ordered two different headsets from Amazon so we can have one upstairs in my office and one downstairs where my other half works when he works from home.  I just took this one out of the box and so far is working as it should.,4
"It broke before 6 months of light use, however Plantronics replaced it for just the cost of First-Class postage to return the broken unit after receiving the prompt replacement. Just Google ""plantronics quick web service form"" (without the quotes) and fill out the form.",3
"I've been a full-time telecommuter since November 2005, so I am on headset most of the workday, all week long.  If you don't need background noise cancellation, and you prefer over-the-ear with boom microphone to stick-it-in-your-ear buds  :-)  then this is a very good, reliable bet.  A quick and easy mute switch / volume control is essential for conference calls, and this design is perfect for that.In November 2007 Amazon said this model was currently unavailable, so you might have to find the new model number.",4
"This is the most comfortable headset I've had & really love it. It has volume & mute controls & I can wear it for long periods without any discomfort. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is, it just doesn't last long. I think it is in part that the cord gets yanked a bit here & there, catching on something as I move about, perhaps pulling connecting wires. I've tried other headsets that are not anywhere as good and don't last either. I just pay for this as I need it & accept it as the way it is.",4
"I work from home and use my home phone at least 3 to 4 hours a day. I have Panasonic and have used Panasonic headsets previously. After I cycled through two of them, I decided to give this one a try. I just got it in the mail and it has 3.5 mm jack. My home phone takes 2.5mm jack. There is no information in the product description about the headset jack size so I relied on some of the reviews where people used it successfully for home phone. I also had someone comment that they also received a jack adapter 3.5 to 2.5 mm. I did not get that so this is useless for me.I will be contacting the vendor for a return. Disappointing!",1
"I have been using for daily for one week, with a 900MHz cordless home / office phone.  When my old headset died, I actually tried a cheap $20 brand-X replacement headset.....mistake.  Returned it, and decided to try the mythic Plantronics name.PRO:- Excellent sound quality sending and receiving- All day comfort in headset mode.  Have actually forgotten to remove it a couple times already.- Useful control features (mute, receiving volume, and sending output volume)- Good industrial design  (i.e. cool looking + mike boom is not too long)CON:- Concerns about durability.  The cable thickness and lack of robust strain relief looks like a potential for sudden failure.  Considering this the top of the line, I would have expected better from Plantronics.- Value (paid $45 locally).  Cost more than the phone itself.If it lasts awhile, I expect to be a happy customer.  For $30 on Amazon, I see little downside, and probably no better product for the intended use.",4
"I had a Plantronics headset before, and they've definitely improved on what I already liked:  great sound quality--most people say they can't tell I have any background noise even when I'm in the car, and comfortable headset.I use the over-the-ear version of it so I can hear best, and they've added a mute button on the headset cord, as well as the volume control.A great value for the money, and hard to improve on for any price.",5
The sound quality is the best of any home headset I've ever used. I bought another brand at a RadioShack and it sounded HORRIBLE.But the manufacturing quality is bad. It only lasted for a year before it broke and I had to buy a new one (I guess that's how Plantronics makes extra profits).,4
"This purchase was for a backup of one I had bought previously that has worked very well. After reading other reviews where people had stated that it only lasted 4-6 months before breaking I bought another one for back up. I have found it to be very comfortable and have used it several times for 1-2 hour conversations. I have put my phone in my shirt pocket and roamed the house while talking with no loss of clarity. I may have to buy another one as my wife is thinking of using the backup. I don't think the unit is that fragile, but some people are hard on things. I don't know if I would recommend it for continuous all day use, but if handled with reasonable care it seems it should last a lot longer then 6 months.",5
"Product arrived in time and worked successfully. It came with no documentation, although it was fairly easy to figure out.",4
"There seems to be some conflicting information about using this headset with the iPhone among the existing reviews. For the record, the jack on this headset is not the right size for use with the iPhone 4.",3
"Finally, I have found a headset with a 2.5mm plug which actually works and with which the folks on the other end of the phone can hear me.  I bought this for my corded office phone, not a mobile or cordless phone, and it works great.  I really wanted a headset with the 2.5mm plug, and this is the ONLY one I have found which works well enough for me and has adjustable mic input.  Not sure about durability yet.  Quality seems okay, cord does seem somewhat thin.",4
I have used this very model headset for many years and yes after several years they do wear out as do many things but when I had to replace the one I had I found it here at Amazon.com and not only were they new but they were the least expensive I could find anywhere. Some site were asking as much as 4 times what I paid here.. Thanks once again Amazon.com,5
I've had this model for years. I'm happy to keep buying them when they wear out because the sound quality is good and the mute button on the cord is a lifesaver when office interruptions happen in the middle of a phone call. I've used this model for over 8 years with a Radio Shack headset amplifier and the Nortel and Polycom phone systems. Love it.,5
It is nice that it gives the option to use either over the head or over the ear. The padded speaker cover is comfortable and will not wear out like the foam kind. I used the switch to turn the the mic on and off a lot and has made it much more useful to me.,4
"This is the third time I have ordered a Plantronics product. I had to return two of them. Ist set of earhones just didn't work and the latest was the Plantronics Over-Head/Ear Headset, M175C. Out of the box the headset had a loose connection. The slightest movement caused it to cut out. Returned the product to the seller.",2
"After trying dozens of headsets for my phone I was a little hesitant to try another one, but I've heard good things about the Plantronics brand so I thought I'd give this a try. Most of the headsets I've used suffered from poor reception or poor design (or both). I was both pleased and surprised that the M175C excels in looks and function. Calls received were crisp and clear with no static or noise of any kind. The headset can be used over the head or folded to place behind the ear. It comes with a nice cushy ear piece if you decide to use it over your head, which I did. The volume control on the cord has a clip above it so you can attach it to your shirt or pocket and easily adjust the sound with the small thumb wheel. This works remarkably well and I find myself using it more than the volume control switch that's on my phone. Because the headset is so light even after wearing it for a couple hours I can hardly tell I have it on. It's so nice to finally be able to move around, make a cup of coffee, wave my hands in the air, or whatever.I highly recommend the M175C to anyone who wants a decent headset for their phone.",5
"This headset is my favorite. I've used them for years and they wear out from use, which is to be expected. I hope they keep producing it. If the headband is too tight for you, just bend it a little. It also comes with an ear loop. Great incoming and outgoing volume controls.",5
"For the price, you can't beat this little headset.  The mute switch sets it apart from other headsets, which is a must-have feature for conference calls.It is also comfortable, and in my expererience, fairly durable.  I've used this headset for 2 years with no complaints.  In fact, I'm listening to a conference call on it right now. :-)",5
"I find these headsets perfect for use on my home telephone.  It allows me to make phone calls while I'm doing other things, whether it's doing dishes, or typing on the computer.  The party on the other side never knows I'm using a headset, as the voice quality is perfect.",5
"My only hesitation about buying this product was that, while the bluetooth and other wired devices keep getting smaller and sleeker, this one looks like something from 10 years ago.  Nonetheless, I recommend it and would buy it again because it gives the best sound quality of the devices I've tried, it's very comfortable (I don't like ear pieces that hang onto my ear for support), and it has volume and mute controls at a decent price.  When you find a good price, I recommend buying several so you can keep one in each car, one by each indoor phone (I use it more for hands-free indoors than with my cell phone in the car), and because they will eventually break.",4
"I paid a little more for these than another pair, thinking the Plantronics brand and the boom would enhance sound quality for those I talk to. Actually, I've been told the sound of my voice is slightly less clear than the piece I had been using at half the price. So would not recommend.",1
"This headset is worth every extra penny. I've used this model and its siblings for 3 years and attest to the quality and value of Plantronics equiptment. I've bought three of their phones (2 as gifts) and have never  had a problem. When one of their products eventually wore down from high  use, they replaced it promptly with no hassle. They make most of the call  center equiptment in the world and it shows.This is a great product made  by a great company.",5
"I've had this gadget for a while now.  It was well thought out and it works well.  I'm completely pleased.  I made my decision based on the comments by Amazon reviewers.  Thanks for the good advice, people!",5
"The headset fits the standard 2.5mm jack found on many cordless phones. The fit is comfortable and the sound is fine, both incoming and outgoing. However, mine broke just shy of two months after I bought it.",2
"I enjoy this over-the-head headset.  I have tried over-the-ear and earbud hands-free units, but this is by far the most secure and comfortable hands-free style.  The volume control is easy to use and it has handy mute on/off switch.  No more finding the mute button and adjusting the volume on my Treo 650 anymore (pretty dangerous while driving).  My only complaint is the volume is a little low if you're talking to a soft-spoken person.  But it's tough anyway to listen to him/her without the headset, plus you can detach the cushion on the earpiece so the receiver is a little closer to your ear.",5
I have hearing aids so I needed one that just laid on the ear.  This works fine even with my iPad.,4
"I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset. I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset. It is clean. No scratches. No faded labeling. It looked to be brand new. Oh yeah...it works great, too.&#128077;",5
now that I have used it for sometime now I can say that it holds up to what I put it through so I would recommend it to my friends and the time it took to get was right on time and now I just put my headset on instead of having to hold the phone up to my ear so I can have more of the long conversations,5
"This is a great product.  I was able to purchase it from Amazon for only $25.00, and definitely got my money's worth.  I like this model because it has volume controls for both your voice output, and your hearing input.  I use it as a headset, and the only complaint I have is that the speaker has a lot of bass.  There are not any highs in the voice you hear, so your friend's voice always sounds emotionless and flat.  I guess it is this way to protect your hearing.  The sound is quite clear, just a limited frequency response.",5
"I am in a job that requires me to be on the phone all the time.  I have been using this same exact brand of Plantronics headset for years.  It lasts about 1-2 years, but that seems about the norm with all the headsets I have had, or have heard about from others.  I like that there is a mute option on the wire and it is very comfortable.",5
"I've had this product for about a year and half.  I've had no problems at all.  People can hear clearly on the other end, the Mute switch doesn't make any noise, volume control seems adequate.  It's been very durable too, I've dropped it on the floor a bunch of times and it has been unaffected.  Most importantly, the sound reproduction quality is excellent.  Other headsets I've used in the past have degraded the sound quality noticably.",5
"This is a great unit. I've had it about 3 weeks now. I use it with my GE 5.8 GHZ cordless home phone and it works fine.  I work from home 2-3 days a week and attend or host conference calls about 2-4 times a day.  My coworkers tell me I sound loud and clear.  The set is comfortable; lightweight but not flimsy or fragile; with padded ear piece. I especially like the mute switch/volume control on the cord.  The cord is long enough to give me plenty of slack with the phone clipped to my waist band and I'm 6'3"" so that's important.  I would highly recommend this unit.",5
Made it to the junk tech drawer. Not worth the cost of return.  Not really the worth of completing the minimum word number for the review. Generally I don't pan a product but tested this on two phones. Keep looking.,1
"My biggest problem is the SO keeps borrowing this when she takes conference calls at home.OK - second problem. Now I have a USB headset for skype/etc, and a wired headset for cell phones and when traveling (I usually don't bring the USB headset - too fragile). So now my nest of wires has gotten a little worse. Generally I don't like the quality/reliability of bluetooth, but I may try again in the next few months.",5
I replaced 3 of these and then finally bought a DeCT 6 phone system and a dedicated all in one vs a cord like this. Cord and connection is a weak spot.,3
"I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money.",4
"I bought this headset to use with my cordless phone system which I use with Skype.  I have a Bluetooth headset on my left ear, and I keep this one on my right so I can answer my cell phone and the regular phone simultaneously while I am working on my computer.  I use only Motorola cell phones and Bluetooth units, and previous cordless phone headsets left a lot to be desired.  The Plantronics unit is wondeful; it's light enough that I forget it's there, and even half-deaf me can hear it well.  The adjustable hearing is great, as is the adjustable volume on the microphone.  I heartily recommend it.",5
"Works fine, we have bought multiple models of Plantronics headsets and due to rough duty in my wife's purse, they all eventually fall apart. But while they survive they work great. Have tried ear buds, ear canal, blue tooth etc, but keep coming back to this style Plantronics for overall functionality.",4
I purchased this headset for use when on the cell phone. The sound quality and way it fits is excellent. The headband could be a bit sturdier but I am careful when expanding or shortening it so I think it is fine.,4
"I've been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through.",5
"Love this type of headset.  I use one at work every day, so I got one for home too.  I hate things &#34;in&#34; my ear, so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Doesn't even mess up hair.  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it.  It converts to an &#34;ear hook&#34; type also, but I don't find that very useful.  The inline volume control and mute is nice, although a bit large and heavy.  Great sound quality",5
"This headset works great! I've been using it for several weeks now and the sound is clear and the fit is comfortable. I spend several hours a day on the phone, so comfort was a biggie for me.",5
Convenient and easy to use - allows you to carry on a conversation and still listen in on conference calls.,5
Very good headset. The first one was damage due to improper use. But this is a headset that we use everyday for work. 6 hours per day on average.Not perfect but very good and excellent range.,4
"I bought this headset to plug into myPhilips VOIP841 PC-Free DECT 6.0 Wireless IP PhoneandPhilips VOIP 321 Skype Dual Phone Single Handset ( VOIP3211G/37 )to let me call into teleconferences whilst still having my hands free to type.Pros:- Compatibility: Worked without issues with both my cordless phones.- Features: The headset allows adjustment of earpiece and microphone volumes which allows the headset to be tweaked to work optimally for the phone and user. Also, having a mute switch on the cable control module is very useful.- Audio Quality: Incoming voices come in loud and clear and I've never had any complaints about my voice being unclear.- Comfort: I wear this for at least an hour at a time and have never felt uncomfortable wearing it. There is the usual adjustable headband, the microphone boom can be moved and the earpiece can be worn on either ear.Cons:- A version with two earpieces rather than just one would have been preferable.",4
"This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I'm guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor.",3
"Bottom line, Plantronics makes the best headsets.  I've been very happy with this one.  People say they can hear me very clearly, and it's very comfortable to wear on long conference calls.  If it breaks in the future I'm sure I'll buy another Plantronics headset (this model or a comparable one).",5
"I use a headset every day. The first one stopped working within a month, got it replaced (I have to pay for the return shipping) and the second one stopped working in a week (still have to put a warranty claim in). Decided to spend a few extra dollars and purchased the Plantronics HW261N Binaural Headset with the Plantronics 18straight Cable - Quick Disconnect To 2.5 Mm Plug,",1
Someone told me that Plantronics was cheap but I beg to disagree!  Yes; the price was quite reasonable but the quality sound is great.,5
"I bought this for its durability, but the sound quality was pretty low/poor; volume was low too.",4
Works exactly as advertised.  Great for conf calls at home to keep hands free.  Mute button works great.  Use it on my home cordless phone and my blackberry with no problems.,4
"I spent many hours searching for a good headset for my Clarity XLC 3.4 Cordless Phone for the hearing impaired and settled on this one as the most bang for the buck. I was hoping for a headset to improve my hearing even with this phone, which it did, but only marginally so. It is convenient not to hold the phone to speak into it. The best about this headset is its very low price of $17.48 through The OEM Shop. For that low price, what can one really expect. (I did note many similar offerings for this headset from other suppliers ranging to several times what I paid). At any rate, the image depicts two ear hooks; I received only one size which seems too large to be useful. I received with the package a short adapter cable to convert the headset's connector from 3.5 mm to the necessary 2.5mm for my phone.  The assembly is a bit clumsy when connected to my phone. The ear cushion is rather small (the image shows two). The entire headset construction is a bit fragile, and I don't expect it to last very long, so treat the unit with kid gloves. No instructions were supplied to convert to the ear hook, and I hesitate to try to adapt fearing to break the plastics.",3
"I had bought several of the wal-mart variety headsets and was getting pretty frustrated with their quality, lack of mute feature, etc, so finally I decided to spend some real money.  I have a Plantronics headset at work that is decent, so I bought this one.  It's even better than my headset at work!It is convertible from headset to earpiece (for those who like that sort of thing.  The little padded thingy for the earpiece (when used in headset configuration) is very comfortable.  I don't notice any discomfort even after 3-4 hours of usage.  There is a mute switch on the wire, and both the earpiece and microphone volumes are adjustable.I have only had mine for a month or so, so I can't comment on the durability issues yet.  Apparently, I'm not as acrobatic as some reviewers, so I don't expect problems.I really can't think of anything that I do not like about this piece of equipment.",5
"This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i.e. very good). The 2.5mm jack means it won't fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it's great (both 8820 and Pearl). As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming. Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around. It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference. I'll buy it again if/when this one finally dies.",4
Plantronics is always a dependable brand and the quality of sound both incoming and outgoing is just as I expected.,5
Awkward to use and the pieces  were difficult to put together (the padded ear cushion would NOT go on ... and no instructions were provided).  Uncomfortable on my head and basically more trouble than it was worth.  Will keep trying to find a good &#34;plug-in&#34; headset for my iPhone as an alternate to bluetooth.  My biggest problem was that it wasn't clear from the description that I HAD TO ALSO ORDER the 2.5 - 3.5 adapter in order for the plug to work with my iPhone 4.  Went all over trying to find such an item to no avail (even Best Buy didn't carry anything).  Trying to return it.,1
"By trying to be all things to all people, this headset is a compromise.  If you just want something to wear over your head you'll find Plantronics M214C to be better, and half the price.  Get that instead.(Just to be clear, I do own both this and the M214C).",2
"I got a Panasonic KX-TCA60 and this Plantronics M175C.  The Plantronics M175C is definitely better.  It is more comfortable, and the microphone is more sensitive and has better sound quality.Scott",5
"Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality.",2
"I had been looking for a good headset to use with my cordless phone at home. I have tried many headsets and none worked well enough for the people on the other end of the call to hear me. With this headset I can hear everyone clearly and they can hear me clearly. The price was great as well, under $20.",5
"I love Plantronics headsets. The one I use for Skype and for my computer has worked flawlessly for over 9 years. The one that my boyfriend uses for his cell phone has worked flawlessly for the past three years on a daily basis. When I needed a headset for my Samsung Brightsides, and other cheaper brands were failing me, I decided to shell out money for the Plantronics Mobile Convertible Headest.The sound quality on this headset is clear without any fuzziness or distraction. However, and this is a huge however, even on the highest volume setting on both the phone and the headset, the person on the other end of the phone has a very, very quiet voice. You are constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said, and for me, that's a problem. I tried fooling with the settings. I have had everything from ear buds to headsets with the Brightside and the Plantronics Convertible Headset has the lowest sound of any of them.The convertible feature is nice. You can use it as an over the ear headset or a headband style headset. I was not interested in the over the ear headset offering, so I immediately made it into a headband style headset. The little &#34;ball&#34; that the headband attachment seats into is not very sturdy and the constant swivel makes it easy to break if you aren't careful. I do like the swivel motion, so that you can adjust the ear cushion to fit comfortably on your ear. One note about the headset in headband mode, even though the height adjusts, it doesn't adjust far, either that or I have a really tall head, because I couldn't get it to adjust high enough to fit comfortably near my ear, it was always slightly above.Another complaint about the headset is the side that does not have the cushion is a very weird shape with grooves, and I have long hair, every time I removed the headset, it would get caught in my hair. I put a spare headphone cushion over it, but there was nothing to keep it in place. I would literally have to yank my hair, or cut my hair around the headset to remove it from my head. This is while sitting in one place, with the headset placed on carefully and not adjusting it all day. I tried both with my hair down and with my hair in a pony tail and both ways the headset would get caught in my hair.This headset really defeats the hands free portion of a cell phone headset. You cannot answer a call without touching the answer button on your phone. If you are driving, or multi tasking, this can be a pain. I have a Samsung Brightside and I was having difficulties hanging up after a call, I would hit the end button, nothing would happen. I would hit the unlock button and then the end button, and nothing would happen. It was so frustrating. I eventually would have to remove the battery from the phone after every call and put it back in to end the call, not a whole lot of fun. This could have been eliminated had Plantronics added a simple hang up/answer button to this headset. I know it's not a difficult thing to add, because every headset and ear bud set I have ever owned has one, even ones that cost a third of the price.I had a lot of problems using these headsets with the Samsung Brightside, the sound would cut in and out and make it difficult to hear, the sound would have an echo to it, etc. I know the Samsung Brightside isn't a great phone, but I've had cheaper headsets with better quality with the Brightside then this headset produced.I did not try the over the ear mode, as I am not comfortable with that kind of attachment on my ear. Maybe if I wasn't dead stuck on a headset that goes over the head, headband style, I would have had more luck with this headset, but I doubt it. After three days of using one, the microphone snapped off. I decided to return both, while I could, to Verizon, and ask for a complete refund because this is definitely not what I thought I was purchasing.",2
"I purchased this headset because my old Plantronics headset fell apart. I do like this headset but I have been told that people can sometimes barely hear me when I am talking, so I have to move the mouth piece a little closer which sometimes causes my ear piece to move away from my ear.  Overall I am please with this purchase.",4
"Good sound quality. Good price. Convenient in-line mute, mic and earpiece volume controls.  Versatile.  Will get uncomfortable for all-day users. IMO better than similar Panasonic (with the silly foam covered boom mic).",5
"They fit, they are not tiresome, the sound is clear. All of the features work flawlessly. People are very satisfied when I am on them, there is no strange sound to my calls. It comes with the short cable I need to use with my Panasonic handsets. It is light weight and having the controls on the line make it perfect for my use. If I needed another set for another location in my home, I would buy the same product again.",5
These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties. The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time.,5
"I have had no trouble at all with this headset.  By the way, I recently bought a Panasonic KX-TCA98 headset and it's almost exactly the same, but a few bucks cheaper.  The difference is that the Panasonic does not have a microphone gain adjustment switch.",4
"Not many sources to buy floppies these days, got it to copy DOS software for old application on Virtual Machine.The labels included are of very low quality, won't stick, and got caught in the reader, had to be removed with a tweezer.Otherwise, it is what it is--3 1/2 floppies.",4
"With so few sources remaining for IBM formatted floppy disks, I was relieved to find them available on Amazon. With old computers still in use, and with Sony Mavica floppy disk cameras still in circulation, the demand for fresh, new disks, however rapidly dwindling it might be, is definitely still there.The quality may have slipped a bit over the years, since of the many boxes I purchased, each had one or two defective disks that would not read or write, regardless of the efforts to reformat them. Even so, it was still a bargain.",5
"They work just fine, I forgot how slow and noisy these are! Packaged well and shipped fast, not really much more to say about them.",4
"The floppies work just fine for storing data with vintage music gear like the Yamaha EX5 or Akai S-series samplers. The only negative is that Sony is kind of stingy with the labels - they are only half size.Considering the price of SmartMedia cards these days, I'm tempted to buy a few boxes both for my own future use and as an investment. There is a lot of 1990s-eara music gear that relies on floppy disks. Workstations, samplers, grooveboxes/sequencers, etc.",4
"Good product.  The floppy disks worked fine as advertised.FYI, I bought an External USB floppy drive to write these disks in the modern PCs(mostly for reprogramming BIOS on old motherboards).",5
"I bought a pair of headphones from another company for ... way more money.  I stumbled on these as I didn't want to leave such expensive headphones in my desk at work.  Turns out, I never should have bought the more expensive pair.  I'm sure there are better ones on the market, but for my ears these are more than enough.",5
"I order these headphones in May 2012 and I've been using these since on average about 6hrs/day up until about August, and have been using them on and off since. These are GREAT headphones! They produce quality sound, provide great comfort (even for giant Dumbo ears like mine), and they're super sturdy. There are my first pair of headphones of this quality so I don't really have anything to compare to other than Beats ear buds, but these are two very different products. In all, these outperform the Beats earbuds in every aspect except for portability, comfort, and sound cancelling ability.These headphones will take some time to get use to if you're not used to wearing bulky headphones; they weight about a pound or so. With the weight, the band tends to sit on the top of head, regardless of how I adjust it, and it caused a little pain initially but it's no longer a problem because I've gotten used to it. The headphones are completely over the ears, so that took some time to get used to as well because that can also cause a little pain initially as well; I've also gotten used to this. One other problem is the adapter, the 3.5mm adapter is massive and sticks out of my computer like 2-2.5"" so it's nearly impossible to use it with the computer at an incline (ie: on a laptop chill pad, or even watching it on your lap).Even with this all said it's still the best pair of headphones I've owned and it seems like it'll continue providing quality sound for many years to come.",5
"Got these to monitor my new sony nx70u video camera. Like everyone says, they don't color the sound which is important when monitoring the sound from the camera. You don't want any unnatural enhancement that isn't really there. About the tightness, for me they are perfect.  They are not tight at all. I have an average size head for a 6'1&#34; 250lb guy. The cord is long too and it has a tight spring to it so that if you walk away from the camera forgetting that these are on your head you wont pull the camera off the tripod.",5
"Idk it the faults i find are just because its supposed to be a certain way but these headphones dont make me bob my head and feel the music when im listening to it. Buts its probably because it doesnt have that warmth a lot of people mention about. It picks up every single freakin detail though like the reverb from Tupac's song (Who do u believe in) i've never heard such clarity like that in any headphones ive had, even from the KOSS portapro, which are also freakin amazing. The bass in this isnt outstanding either but its probably intended to be like that so all of the things i knock it off for is probably because they're not intented to be that way. So in conclusion, these head phones, to me arent really my option to listen to tunes but are mainly for recording, which is why i bought them. So =DOh yeah and its a bit sensitive in my headphone jack on my Macbook pro, a little staticy sound, very very faint, is noticeable when u move the jack.",5
"After not many hours of use, the entire ear pad on one side became detached from the plastic base plate. The synthetic leather covering was either press fitted or glued over the edge of this plastic part. It looked like I probably could have stretched the thing back over the plastic lip, although it would have taken some time. But because it would certainly have happened again with normal use anyway, I ended up throwing the whole thing away. What a waste. Overall, a very poor design in my view.",2
"Perhaps my ears have been sullied by 'augmented' headphones in the past, but these particularly 'phones feel flatter and more lifeless than any others.  I'm not talking about a lack of thumping bass... that's fine by me.  But rather... well, it's hard to describe.  No warmth.  No resonance.  Just sterile.I suppose this'd be fine or perhaps even desireable for studio monitor work, but when I'm trying to enjoy folk tunes, classic jazz, orchestral music... it's just disheartening.",3
"Best headphones I have ever had. These are also the most expensive headphones I ever purchased. So, I can't really compare them to more expensive brands.I find that it is much easier to distinguish between different instruments and musical notes with these headphones as they provide much less blurring together of sound that other cheaper headphones I have owned.The only problem I had was that the headband started to cause the top of my head to hurt after about 1/2hr to and hour.- To fix this I just cut out a piece of memory foam from my beds mattress cover and used rubber bands to strap it to the headband.It looks ridiculous but works great.",5
"Just love them. They are loud, a lot. Sound crispy and the bass is great. I use them for my desktop and the long cord let me move free. I recomend these a lot. ps: they get a little warm on your ears.Update: After using them for one year, I have to say that all my other headphones sucks :P . The sound of these V6 are way wayyyyy better than any other I ever had. Watching movies with dts and my V6 it's just awsome. I'm very glad I got them.",5
"I purchased this pair of headphone around four years ago.  I used it from time to time - much less lately.  At the very beginning, I first ran it for at least a hundred hours - leaving it plug to a CD player or PC and keep playing a few different kinds of music.  I found the headphone reproducing high frequencies and low frequencies quite good.  However, it lacks mid-ranging; resulting that the music reproduced felt a bit &#34;thin&#34; and not warm enough (but not harsh).  I mostly listen to classical music, easy listening, Jazzy, vocal, instrumental, etc., but no hard rock.Also, it's not comfortable for wearing long times -- more than 30 mins -- you'll feel too warm to your ears; also the headphone is a bit heavy.",3
"As the title of my review implies, I am a former ""Koss-Lover""...was not necessarily a ""Sony-Hater"" since I've been buying their earbuds for years... However, although I've heard Sony headphones previously, purchasing the V6 was still a chore since I had never actually bought a pair...preferring the Koss TD-80s and TD-65s over the Sony offerings... However, Koos has ceased those models and have adopted lesser engineering. Thus, Sony was a breath of fresh air.I've allowed these headphones to fully break in before using them for any recordings... I recorded with them yesterday. Damn! Wow... Damn and Wow again. The quality of the sound--the true full range of the sound--was stunning...almost made me forget what I was recording. Excellent pair of headphones! At this point, I want to purchase another pair, but I'll wait until I have a surplus of funds since it seems the price keeps going up on them...If you're ""on the fence""...stop playing...get these!!If you're not using these for recording, or not going to use these on a more amplified source (Such as a home receiver or headphone amplifier of some sort) don't fret... I've listened to these on my T-Mobile MyTouch with sufficient sound and quality sound reproduction...So, I'm sure your IPod will do fine. :-)Enjoy!",5
"I bought these after a lot of research and I am glad that I did, one of my co-workers actually got the more expensive MDR 7506 and we ended up doing a side by side sound test.  We played some FLAC files through VLC using the Focusrite USB 2i2 DAC and though they both sound good on their own, you can clearly tell that the 7506 is coloring the sound significantly.  Also, the bass response on these seems to be better as well.Some people have complained about the comfort of these and I have worn them for hours on end while working and have found them to be incredibly comfortable.  I might enjoy the new ear pads because they supposedly help improve the sound quality, if/when I do I will update this to see if the combination is worth the hassle/money.All in all amazing headphones especially considering the price, you cannot go wrong with these.",5
"My husband loves listening to music when he goes to bed, and I hate it. He suggested I get these for him so that he can listen and I can sleep in peace. I think I love them more than he does! He used to use just ear buds and I could hear what he was listening to plain as day. I can't hear anything when he is using these headphones. He says that the sound with these are fantastic, like you're in a home theater. We both think they are worth the money.",5
"I'm taking a digital music course this semester, and so the class requires a pair of high-quality headphones in lieu of a textbook. Being a perpetually poor audiophile who then had an excuse to buy nice headphones on somebody else's dime, I settled down to research. After hours and hours of looking and reading ratings and trying on different styles in the stores, I finally settled on the Sony MDR-V6, having been warned away from the newer Sony model that was supposed to replace them. Obviously the ear cups haven't died yet, but I know they will in a few years, and I don't mind at all.I just got them in earlier this afternoon, and I haven't taken them off since without it being absolutely necessary. I've been listening to music for hours now. The biggest fear I had with buying new headphones was that they wouldn't be able to reproduce both sharp highs and smooth lows with clarity and without sibilance. After about an hour of listening to Emilie Autumn's electric violin, which has both in abundance, I have to say that my fears were laid to rest. I then moved on to the rest of my music library, and so far - with only a few hours of breaking-in - it all sounds amazing. Metal, rock, classical, reggaeton, electric, jazz, trance, everything. There's a touch of bass that I can't usually hear, and I'm not sure if that's enhancement from the phones or just because I can actually hear better now, but I like it.All in all, one of the best not-a-textbooks I've ever bought, and I see myself loving these way after this class is over.",5
"I can't stand those tinny earbuds. I bought the best ones I could find for my Droid 2, and they seemed ok, for awhile.  Then I purchased the FIIO D11 and paired it with these headphones. What can I say...it's awesome.  The FIIO on low gain, with EQ set to zero, my droid volume as loud as it would go, makes these headphones loud. Really loud. At high gain, they're too loud. But even then, there's no distortion. None. The sound is crisp and clear.  Drums sound like you're standing in front of the drummer. It's like you're on stage. Just like the other reviews say, you can hear things in the music that you don't even notice using the headphones mortals use.It comes with a nice carrying bag. The bag has a drawstring. It's a nice, leather or faux leather bag, but with the drawstring I can't put the extras in without worrying about them falling out in the wrong place. But I didn't expect the bag, so who cares? The phones fold up easily, and quickly, and won't take up much carry-on space.These phones are really comfortable. I was worried that they would sit ON my ears, but my ears fit nicely inside the cups. And it's easy to adjust them for a perfect fit.I have a trip coming up in a few weeks, and I'm looking forward to putting these on and rediscovering my music collection. I wish I was leaving right now!I highly recommend you get both items in this review, if you have a droid and want quality sound.  Without the FIIO, these phones are probably loud enough for most people. Even on an airplane. They sound as loud to me as my tinny headphones did, but without sounding crappy. Like I'm sitting in my living room listening to a quality stereo.",5
head pad part  can be folded easily and save lots of room.and it came with extra adapter for big hole. so my daughter can use it for her digital piano and listening music from regular MP3 player,5
"I don't remember how long I've owned these headphones but it has to be close to 20 years.(The only maintenance I have done is replace the foam earpads) I have treated them with care and kept them from any type of abuse. They still look almost new and still sound exceptional. More recently I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD590 phones thinking that perhaps I would get even better quality sound. Indeed, the 590's sound very good but frankly, though they sound slightly different than the v6's, I don't think they sound any better.The v6's have a presence and clarity which is very compelling. They can thunder the bass if need be and sail through through the high treble effortlessly.The mid-tones are clear and mellow. Distortion is inaudible. If you are wanting to step up to audiophile quality headphones for a very reasonable amount of money I recommend the Sony MDR-V6 headphones.",5
The sound is good but the design has a flaw and that is  the connection between the line cord and the ear piece lose connectivity.,2
"I bought these to use when playing electric guitar, so I don't disturb  my wife and neighbors with my bad playing..  I wanted something comfortable, durable, with a long cord.  These fit the bill perfectly.  They are well built, fold easily, and fit in a durable bag easily.  The sound quality is excellent.  I've heard static a couple of times when shifting the guitar, but that's not the fault of the headphones.  I have a medium sized head, and they fit me snugly but comfortably.  I can get a bit of nausea when using them, but not nearly as bad as some other headphones I've tried.I'm very satisfied with these headphones, they are well worth the price.",5
"I love these things. Incredibly flat response, great for mixing live or in the studio. Great for listening to music on my mp3 player. Excellent build quality.",5
"I've had these phones for 15 or 20 years, can't acctually remember.  I use them daily for long periods of listening and then I'll leave them for a while and go to the stuido speakers.  They still look like the same model they sell now. They are extremely accurate.  Will rip up a bad recording and make a good one sound everything it should.  The ear pads are vinyl, but under that on my was a terry cloth so I peeled the vinyl away about 15 years ago and they are more comfortable.  I haven't heard any phones that sound any better than this in my looking around.  If they give out after 20 or 30 years I'll get another pair in a heartbeat.  But this pair are like old blue jeans to me.  You won't be disappointed with this.  I think you would have to shop long and hard and spend lots more to get this quality in any other model or make.",5
"These are some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned.  The sound quality is good--everything comes through clearly and cleanly.  Unfortunately, I'm running into the same problem a number of other people here have mentioned.  Static from the plug end.  I'm not sure if it's the plug itself or the wire but the slightest movement can cause static and even cause one of the speakers to cut out.  It's bad enough that my android devices think I've disconnected the headphones and helpfully pause the music.  I returned the first pair but the second pair had the exact same problem.  I've tried them on multiple devices--phone, tablet, PC, even on a home stereo with the adapter it comes with.  Same problem everywhere.  I'm not sure what happened at Sony but I'd advise staying away from these headphones until they fix the issue.",2
"When I saw recently in SONY's on-line  store (store.sony.com/over-the-head/cat-27-catid-All-Over-Head-Headphones;pgid=m2lmcD9xx_pSRp3Bc5rNsKM_0000uLEOXrV1;sid=JA3P7quxLCbd7vj0oz9r6jO77TaBK2KKasjJt9Lj) that the MDR-V6 headphones have been re-issued as ""new"" in 2014, and that Amazon is an authorized dealer, I ordered a new pair to back up my original ""Made in Japan"" V6 cans that I've had forever as a recording engineer.The current ones are ""Made in Thailand"" and the box carries a 2014 copyright. The new 2014 version sounds close to my excellent Japanese originals that I used for monitoring/mixing/mastering in my recording studio. Evaluated using original lossless digital masters from my recording studio as the source, and measured against my studio reference AKG Austrian made K701s, I find the new V6 are not as well balanced across the audio spectrum as the K701 headphones. The 2014 V6 has a noticeable boost in the low bass - educated guess, about +4dB or +5dB centered broadly around 70Hz - making them a bit less suitable for studio work (monitoring/mixing/mastering) than the K701s, and about +2dB or +3dB higher in the low bass than my vintage MDR-V6 headphones were when new. The 2014 V6 has excellent mid and high range reproduction, has very good image placement/sound stage, and no audible distortion, but does not  reproduce the low end of my master recordings quite as faithfully due to the low bass boost.The fit of the new V6 for me is snug without being tight or uncomfortable. Leakage is minimal, if at all, at anything less than levels that will damage hearing; and the isolation from external sounds is very good. Fitment is good, and the stitching on the leather headband is well done. But physically they seem just a tad ""different"" somehow. The originals have the feel of solid construction. Although the new ones look to be put together well, they just don't give that same sense of being as solid and durable.Earpads look like the pleather that's been problematic in the past for flaking. Another minor gripe - the cable of the new headphones was so tightly packed into the box that the coils are deformed in several places - but I was able to get the cable back in shape.So I've knocked off one star because of my subjective feeling about the physical qualities, and being a bit less suitable for studio monitoring/mixing/mastering than the AKG K701s. I'd have to determine exactly where and how much low bass needs to be EQ'd down to use these as highly accurate reference cans. That shouldn't be with headphones billed as ""studio monitors"", and it's a departure from the signature of the original ""Made in Japan"" V6 headphones, which, when new, were essentially flat over the majority of the audio spectrum (+/- 3dB between 25Hz and 10kHz), as true studio monitor headphones should be.This 2014 version of the V6 is still very good for home listening enjoyment (they also sound darn good with my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone), but some may want to turn the bass control down a bit (about 3dB or so) on the sound source. Consider looking elsewhere if you need a tool to do critical, highly accurate analytic studio monitoring/mixing/mastering.",4
"I was hesitant to spend $75 on a pair of headphones, since I had always had pairs for under $30. My $25 Panasonics were great for the price, and gave excellent service until the inline volume knob started having a flaky connection.After reading the reviews on this item, I went ahead and bought a pair, and I am blown away by the difference in quality that extra $50 buys. The Sonys feel very well made, and they use metal and high quality plastics that make the headphones feel sturdy. I have no doubt these will last as long as the other reviewers are claiming.As for the sound quality, these are phenomenal. I am sure headphone purists will point out that their $700 Grado pair blows these away, but I haven't heard anything in this price range that even comes close.I play my bass guitar through my mixing board, and it is a 5-string model with the low string tuned to a low B. My old cheaper pair of headphones would always distort when I played full volume on the low end of the B string, and I thought I was overdriving the preamp on the mixing board, but after plugging in the Sonys, I discovered it was actually the headphones. The Sonys give extremely deep and clear bass reproduction all the way down to the lowest note on the bass.My only complaint is it takes about 75% volume on an iPod to get a reasonable listening volume, compared to about 55% on my old headphones. However, if you plug them into an amplified source (such as a mixing board, headphone amplifier, home stereo receiver, etc) you should have no trouble getting good volume.",5
quality is heard here. nice fit and doesn't smash my head.  I wear glasses and have a hard time finding headphones that don't hurt.  sound with great and drowns out back noise well.,5
"Love these, Light weight, excellant high, mid and low ouput. good frequency response. No fatigue. Never realized quality of the Sony MDR-V6 until you buy them. Oh! these are refurbished a steal!! Look new, sound super!! Happy, Happy customer",5
"I've sampled nearly the whole Sony headphone line, but the V6 is notable for its flattering sound and good value. While it's unlikely to meet the requirements of a seasoned audiophile, it will delight most everyone else with its ability to render many types of music well.The pads are extremely comfortable. (However, continued use may cause the rubber to flake after several years; Beyer makes fine replacement pads.) As you'd expect from closed headphones, the sound is a little ""closed-in"" -- but detailed enough to do justice to anything from classical to punk. These are fun headphones capable of a nice dynamic range.The V6 doesn't try to emulate the sound of a concert hall or a studio; rather, it offers a pleasant musical experience of its own.-- It's reasonably priced-- They play many types of music-- They're easily driven by iPods or CD players-- The V6 is (aside from the pads) an amazingly sturdy performerIf you're picky...-- The sound is ""colored"" (that is, not completely accurate)-- They have a closed-in sound -- a result of their being closed phonesI've since graduated to the Beyer DT880s, a notably better phone. But the V6 has legions of fans, for obvious reasons. Even people who hate Sony headphones concede the V6's attractive sound. They've served me well for over a decade.",5
"Several notes (mostly negative):1.  The cord is unbelievably heavy.  And the jack is massive.  It may very well be designed for durability, but these headphones are not portable in any sense.2.  The headband just is not well designed.  It is made of very wide metal, with a vinyl padded cover.  The headband bows out tremendously -- I mean like 2-3 inches wider than your head on either side, unless you play offensive line in the NFL.  This not only looks awkward; it feels awkward.  Essentially the headband makes contact only at the very center of the top of your head.  This might not be a huge deal, but the headphones are quite heavy (compared to, say, any Bose headphones), and so you feel the whole weight of the phones on the top of your head.3. The earpads feel pretty nice.  But when I switched back and forth between 2 Bose around-ear headphones and these, these ones were much more cramped around your ear.  So not terrible, but not all that roomy.4. The sound struck me as very bright.  The most treble I have ever heard from any headphone or full-size speaker.  On certain songs, this is a plus, but for most, it is a bit irritating.  [I listen to a wide variety of 60s-90s rock mostly -- from REM to Snoop Dogg to Bob Dylan to the Clash to Soundgarden to Stevie Ray Vaughn].  In head-to-head comparisons with other high-end headphones, I judged these to be very light in bass.  It's hard to say if they are deficient or the others are exaggerating the bass (I am not a wannabe audiophile), but to me, these headphones lack fullness.  On the plus side, I can hear cymbals and snare much more clearly than with most headphones.  But the botom line is that I need to set my equalizer to reduce treble and/or increase bass to enjoy my music.  And I am someone who rarely touches the tone settings on a stereo (preferring a neutral sound) and am particularly unlikely to feel the need to increase bass.5. They are not very loud.  Only a bit quieter than the Boses, but if you are using an Ipod, they really aren't quite loud enough in my opinion.  The Monster Beats headphones are much, much louder, if that is a concern for you.6. While they do not actively cancel noise, I found them to be quite good at isolation.  Ambient sound was significantly reduced, arguably more so than with the Boses.Overall, too big and heavy and uncomfortable.  I would possibly overlook these issues if the sound was incredible, but it lacks fullness in my opinion.  It might be very good for some kinds of vocals and music, but not for rock music.",2
"I got this on Amazon One Day Sale event...These are great headphones, and in general great electronic equipment, reminding me of the Great SONY of the 80s, when they were making everything with great quality and absolute attention to details. The plastic is solid, the cables are soft and not sticky, the jacks are smooth, the inner steel spring is high quality and elastic and it has small marks to click and lock the headphones opening, L and R marks are different color and glued perfectly on their designated spots :), etc etc. small details, that are indication of how well a product was designed and made. These headphones are such a perfect product.I have very large head - for example, all my life I cannot find sunglasses wide enough to fit me. These headphones are elastic to stay firm, and open enough to fit me without causing any discomfort for several hours. Yesterday I used them non stop for 3 hours - they are not irritating, not heating, not making my ears sweat, etc. I don't think they are tight at all, as some other reviewers mentioned.The cord is long - definitely too long for portable/gym use. These are meant to be used in static condition, in a studio/room/desktop situation. Sitting in a rolling chair, one can move, turn, spin, without needing to take them off.Sound fidelity - great. These are sounding great, not colored, sensitive without pre-amp need. On par with everything that is not pro level and costs up to $300. Definitely worth the money.p.p. I have owned and used probably around 200 headphones, listening from vinyls, pro level studio magnetic rolls / those 64-track ones :) /, micro cassettes, CDs, Laser Disks, all kinds of computer format audio, so I know about electronics. These V-6 are worth the money.",5
"Many years ago, I bought an earlier generation of these phones which I used for many years on business travel with an AIWA portable CD player to while away the hours.They disappeared after use by four of my kids while I was between trips. This new pair is once again a superbly made and designed high fidelity gift to anyone wanting really superb sound.Simply plugging them into a good receiver pumping out DVD sound, and you are instantly into the world of outstanding sound from the DVD and isolated from the sounds in your environment.  The bass, mid and high frequencies are perfectly balanced and extend across a wider range than my large Boston Acoutic 150 speakers. After suffering with the sporadic connection failures and static in the individual plugs on the earpieces of a $300 Sennheiser earphone set (now gone into the trash) I'm happily back with Sony's V6 technology.The sound is better than the Sennheisers when they were new. The bass in the Sony's is spectacular and clean for any price range headphones.If these wear out before I do, I'll get another set of the same ones.  As long as Sony keeps making the MDR-V6, I'll keep buying them.The listing fails to mention that a very nice leatherette drawstring carrying caseis included to hold the phones and spiral wound cord when folded, just like the one that came with my first set many years ago.",5
fantastic range and clarity for the money. able to remixed songs with great attention to sound range separation and placement,5
"Great sound,very comfortable .I bought the headphones for a replacement  for my older Sony set.I bought the older Sony from EBAY,beware when doing this,it was a fake Sony.Bought at a good price but the overall quality compared to the Sony MDR-V6 was inferior.The fakes are hard to detect,there are web sites that go over ways to check.",4
"Why buy more expensive headphones unless you're into some kind of job that requires better.  This head phones sound great and are very well constructed they will endure many, many years of musical pleasure.  Some reviewers talk about this being a little tight on their ears and that is true but thats when they are new, what i did with mine was bent them open a little bit on the sides of the headrest and that solved the problem.",5
"These are excellent and HUGE step up from the SONY MDR-V600! The sound isolation is good and the headphones bring new life into your existing music collection. You'll hear sounds you've never heard before.I also have the Grado SR60, and those are very good open-ear phones. These are just as good in terms of sound quality. They are also a significant step up from my previous SONY MDR-V600 (which I didn't like and the foam deteriorated quickly).I highly recommend it. As usual, Amazon delivery was quick and arrived before my trip.",5
I'm no audiophile but these are noticeably awesome. Fantastic audio quality all around at a very fair price. Highly recommended.,5
"I have used these headphones before and i must say they are excellent, comfortable, and clamp like they are gonna break your skull. how ever upon ordering my own pair of these i was swindled by this dealer{{{ http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?ie=UTF8&marketplaceID;=ATVPDKIKX0DER&me;=A1SPB9D2DMA0R4 }}}}} AKA yourdealDO NOT BUY THEM FROM THIS STORE THEY ARE COUNTERFEIT REPRODUCTIONS, they are very well made counterfeits but the head band is to thick, the cups are plastic versus metal, and the over all build quality is down the tubes. do your self a favor and find a reputable dealer.",1
"My sister's Bose headphones finally died and so, her being a super audiophile without enough money to buy the high-end stuff, i gave her my JVC HA-RX700 and she loves them even more than the Bose. So that left me with nothing, and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under $50 that I could. I looked at so many headphones, and i still loved my JVC's, but i decided i should probably try something new. and then i found these...I would say that I am...an untrained-audiophile of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones. i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to, but it doesn't exactly ""bother"" me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh, etc. That being said, i loved my JVC's and was sad to see them go, but I've gotta say, i love these bad boys even more. I think it's the bass that separates them...it's punchier and more...accurate, you know? without being overly done. out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance (i think that's the right word), but they've broken in a bit and it's less harsh in that range. but the bass...wow. otherwise they're very similar in my opinion to the JVC's. The treble might be a tad better, but not much if at all. I don't know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it, but that's my two cents. They're also very comfortable, not too tight or anything and very soft padding. I highly recommend them, i can't imagine headphones getting that much better. i've heard Beats by Dre, Bose, and the JVCs, and these are just the best of all of them to me.",5
"I bought these cans after reading loads of review. I am not disappointed--these are the best headphones I've ever owned. They are great for everything from opera to electronic music. You'll hear every detail in the recording, including the noise that maybe there. The sound is present, flat (as in honest) and lively.",5
"This review is aimed at those with eyeglasses and whose ears get pinched between the eyeglass arms and the earphones. I do not like to block up my ears with ear plugs all day for health concerns. I have bought and used these:Sony MDR-CD230Sony MDR-V6Sony MDR-XD200My ears are not real fussy on quality, nearly all headphones give my ears a problem by pressing them against my eyeglass arms and this hurts, usually after 10-20 minutes of listening. My hatsize if about 7.25,my ears are pretty normal in size, I am middle aged. All three of these headphones I own are the best I have tried on or read reviews by eyeglass wearers over past 2 years. Headphones have a left and right side - the cord typically is attached to the left side, and the ear spaces, or cups, are oriented accordingly, to that the back of the ear lobe has more space to sit in than the front of the ear lobe. The sideways pressure (how hard they clamp onto your head) also is a secondary factor in whether my ears hurt. I wear wireframe glasses, and my use for headphones is background music while I program.$30 The CD230 is no longer available, that I could find (Fall 2006), and I've used them for 5 years. They hurt my ears after 3-4 hours of continual use, but are good before that. They have cloth covered ear cushions, and relatively deep ear lobe spaces. This feature in all earphone seems to be the primary feature that determines whether my ears hurt or not. If you can find these, and like cloth covered headphones, you won't be unhappy. The sideways pressure is light for me.$64 The V6 stands out for 2 things - richness and accuracy of the sound and blocking out outside office noises. Listening to classical music, not real loud, a co-worker can speak to my face and his voice is muffled pretty well. (Women's voices too). Overheard conversations are not overheard.I have used these occaisionally for a couple months and my ears/head get sore after 1-2 hours. The sideways pressure is noticeably more than the other two, but not excessive. They are well cushioned, with soft fake thin leather-like vinyl which I did not find causes sweating at all. But there is not a large space for the ear lobes to sit, and this is what causes pressure after a while to build up uncomfortably I am sure. If I did not have my eyeglasses on, then these are very comfortable.$26 The XD200 is a little lighter than the V6, it does not block out outside noises as well, which can be a benefit in the office because I can hear co-workers calling my name. The sideways pressure is light, the cushion is the same thickneess as the V6 but the ear space is much deeper for the earlobe, so for this reason it is the most comfortable of all headphones I've owned or tried. The cushions are covered in the thin leather-like vinyl like the V6 - this stuff feels like a paper much more than a plastic, it feels dry, not clammy. To my unprofessional ears the sound is great. If you wear eyeglasses, don't want to use ear plugs for hours at a stretch, then I think you will be happiest with the Sony MDR-XD200 headphones.",5
These sound great once they break in. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they're built like tanks compared to some others on the market.,5
"I truly and honestly don't get the rave reviews. I'm no super audiophile, but I have a decent surround sound system, appreciate good sound and deep bass. I love hearing fine details in well-recorded and mastered music like a guitar strum. And I swear $40 in-ear phones of just about any random brand have better richer sound than these. I tried them in my surround system, tried them in my iPhone, iPad, iMac, PC, and everywhere it sounded like I had two under-powered, muddy tin cans.I guess I must be crazy, because everyone else seems to love these. I returned and got cheaper in-ear phones, because the sound is much much better.",3
"...and I have never found a superior pair of headphones, period.They are comfortable (with one small adjustment). They have fantastic sound. And for the price (almost always less than a hundred bucks, sometimes much less) even if they do fail or wear out (which they almost never do), they're easily replaced.I can't handle in-ear buds -- my canals are too small and they always hurt. On-ear headphones are a joke. These are perfection. That one small adjustment I mentioned? Get a pair of Beyerdynamic EDT 250 velour replacement pads and suddenly these headphones become the last pair you'll ever need.",5
"No question this product is full on, 5 star material.  I received a pair of these phones in 1991 (maybe 1990, not sure), as a birthday present from my aunt and uncle.  Since receiving them, I have taken them with me all over the world.  I've slept with them on my head on 15 hour flights, I have slept with them in my bed, they have been abused and trounced in all kinds of luggage.Not only do these things sound incredible, they obviously hold up VERY well considering the abuse I have heaped upon mine and they are STILL working and sounding perfectly after these EIGHTEEN (18) years.  I am in awe of their...awesomeness.I have replaced the ear pads once, with these Beyer Dynamic velour pads (highly recommended btw):  [...]I'm 36 years old, and wondering if I will be willing these things to one of my children?!  :)",5
Nice sound without burning a hole in your pocket. I also have Yamaha pro 300. Both are good. Sound qualityof both is very close but each has its own distinct quality. I like the Yamaha one being lighter but it costs a lot more.I just switch between them.,5
"That's what these headphones create for me.  The sound quality is nothing less than awesome, from deep, well-defined bass to clear mid-range (Sade, Billy Joel and Etta James just sound divine!) to sharp (but not overbearing) highs.  The dynamic range is astounding...you'll hear little details in songs you never noticed before.I'm sure you could find better headphones, for a lot more money. But unless you have the hearing of a dog, you're not going to notice enough of a difference to make the extra hundred dollars or so worth your while.  If you're willing to spend some dough, but not wanting to pay a mint, these are highly recommended.My only caveat is that the fit is a little snug.  In a way it's good, because it helps keep background noise out without the distortion that noise cancellation can introduce.  These are ideal for noisy environments where you want to be alone with your sound.  But I could see where individuals with wider than average heads might experience a bit of discomfort with prolonged use.  If I take my glasses off while wearing these headphones, I generally have to take the headphones off to put my glasses back on.  But then again, eyeglasses and headphones are always an awkward mix.",5
"Unbelievable headphones.although they may hurt on your head after 30-40 minutes, the sound quality makes them worth it .",5
"I love these headphones.  They fell really good on your ears, they are made of that soft like material and the compression on your head is not bad at all.Oh the sound, yeah they rock!",5
"I am %100 satisfied with this purchase.  If these disappeared, I would buy a replacement set immediately.The build quality is top notch, much better than you'd expect from the photo.  Other headphones have chinsy hinges, or oversized plastic hinges to appear that they are built well, but when you feel these in your hands, you will know that they will last.  The cord and plug are both pro grade also.The audio quality is great.  Are there better sounding phones?  maybe.  I've had some very expensive Sennheisers, Sonys, a few random off brands and a pair of Grados, all which sounded great.  These Sony's hang with them.  If you can find a pair that sounds better, that pair will be $500, and it won't blow these Sony's out of the water but just barely edge them out on a few details.Comfort is good.  The foam goes fully around your ear(circumaural) and they are a closed can design so they &#34;block out&#34; outside sounds.  They aren't &#34;noise isolating&#34; or &#34;noise reducing&#34;, but they block enough to put you in your own audio space.  If you listen with these, you won't hear the phone ringing in the other room.  If you have sweaty ear syndrome or don't like headphones that are closed, these might not be up your alley.  That is only a preference though and not a ding against these headphones.  I personally really like the closed, circumaural design.  The band and the ear pressure are exactly right.  In ten years, after you've worn through the ear pads, replacements will still be readily available online.Overall, these are the industry standard for a reason.  Time tested, excellent quality, unbeatable value.  Buy these headphones, you will be satisfied with them for sure.",5
Great sound. Comfortable on head and ears. Ears do get warm after a 90 minute movie. I hope they last a long time.,5
"These are the best headphones that I've ever owned. I am prone to headaches, I work in a loud environment, and I like high quality sound. These over-ear headphones block out a lot of noise, don't squeeze too tightly on my head, and have incredible sound quality. I am very happy!",5
"Great sound quality, great value. Highly recommend them. I used to break headphones all the time (1 pair every 6 months), now these have lasted me at least a year.Great value. Just buy them.",5
There's not much to say other than the sound is great and the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Highly recommended.,5
"The headphones I just purchased replaced a faithful pair I've had now for 24 years. Now that I have the new pair I can definitely say that over the years, the old ones lost a lot of bass even though I've replaced the ear pads, and the new pair sounds like I remember the old ones sounding when they were new. All the bass is there, all the highs and definitely all the midrange. The musical detail is extraordinary. I count on these headphones to hear things up close and personal when I'm doing productions and have never found a pair that sounded anywhere near what I get from these. Glad I was still able to get a pair of these V6's. They're #1 in my book!",5
"Amazing headphone value.  If you want big booming bass, pick up a set of V-Moda Crossfades.  If you want to hear subtle nuances in your music which you never new were there before, then these are the phones for you.  Very light and incredibly comfortable to boot.  Quite honestly, I can't imagine how someone could complain that these give a tight fit.  I generally use these with my Nuforce Icon DAC, Google Play Music, and my Toshiba Chromebook.  However, I think they shine the best when using the DAC along with my Onkyo C7030.",5
"As an armature to the hifi sound devices, I have no complain about it so far. It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.After retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.",5
"I've used more than a few headphones over the years, including some Sennheiser pro studio models. The Sennheiser' are typically uncomfortable after an hour or two, so if you plan to spend time at a board they can be painful, and depending on how long you where them the pain can last a day or two. The Sony V6 headset is very comfortable enough so that I've used them all night well actually all day and night without experiencing much discomfort, and the sound in my opinion is superior to anything I've tried recently. In the last few years I've switched to using earbuds for most of my casual listening and simply had forgotten how great a decent full size headset sounds.Over all, I've found this set to be very true reproducing recorded music, and are better than anything I've used in the sub $150.00 price range. One test I've used to compare sound reproduction in the past is to listen to a clean recording of a few acoustic instruments, especially the sound of a piano. If a headset can reproduce the timber and resonance of a full size piano they're usually a good bet. Being a acoustic string guy I also look at how well a set will reproduce the sound of a high end acoustic guitar, mandolin and violin. If they are accurate on those simple tests then I would grab them. This set does a fantastic job of reproducing the sound of everything I listen for with exceptional precision. I paid a lot more than a $100.00 for my Sennheiser' but this set sounds better and is much more comfortable to wear even for short periods of time.I would highly suggest anyone looking at these give them a try and see for yourselves just how good these sound. The range from 5 HZ-30 KHZ should be ample for anyone though the Bass is not exaggerated it is clean tight and powerful enough for myself anyway. Honestly these would be a very good choice for home studio or for casual listening, and if you've been spending hundreds on earbuds you have to give these a try.",5
"54 year old audio engineer, video shooter/editor, former radio host. I used 7506s for my video shoots for many years. They are wonderful. These V6s are every bit as great. Light comfy, straight excellent sound. If you're gonna get a cramp because it doesnt have a red Pro sticker on the side, get 7506s. If you want equally great headphones at steal of a price buy the V6s here, you'll be very happy.Get these phones, and live happily ever after.",5
"These headphones sound wonderful. They are a very faithful reproducer of audio, so you're hearing what the people who made your music or moves want you to hear - not what the people who made your headphones want you to hear. I love that I can listen to dance, orchestral, rock, rap, or basically any style of music with these. The other neat thing about these headphones is that they're standard equipment at nearly every studio ever. So you're more than likely listening on the same headphones that the engineers who mixed down your music used.The simple fact is that these headphones blow $200 beats and other 'designer' headphones out of the water. They just faithfully reproduce sound instead of slamming you with pure bass.One drawback, which might just be a personal thing: they're too narrow for my head. I could just have a wide head, but I feel like the arms are pushing too hard against the sides of my head. I realize that this is partly necessary for good sound (keeps the earcups seated on your ears) but I feel like it could be toned down a bit.",4
"I bought these because I was looking for a nice pair of headphones that sounded as good as the ones I remembered using as a kid when I had to listen to music through headphones while not disturbing my parents watching tv. Little did I know that Sony still makes the same model! That's right, some 18 years later, I now own my own pair of the exact same headphones. If the fact that Sony still makes the same headphones without any changes doesn't say enough about these, then nothing I say would do much justice, but I'll try anyway.I have a 24"" head and despite the other reviewers who have said these headphones fit too tightly, I bought them anyway. Once I got them I did notice they are a bit tight, but since I have no plans to sit in one spot for more than a few hours with these on, this is not a concern to me. Plus, in time I expect them to loosen up a bit simply through constant use. The padding on the ears are very nice, but I can see how wearing these for hours on end might get a bit annoying, but that would probably happen with anything you put on/in your ears.Once on, I can't think of any other headphones I've tried that sound as good. For my desktop speakers, I use aKlipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System (Black)that sounds amazing when playing songs through iTunes or Pandora, so I needed something better than the Apple earphones I was using when I didn't want to blast out my roommates. The MDR-V6 headphones do just that. Of course they don't have the same punch as a floored subwoofer, but surprisingly, the bass in these headphones is quite noticeable.Until I bought these, I wasn't even really using the iTunes equalizer. Now as I change music, I change the EQ because the headphones make you hear sounds you've never heard before! I feel like going back through all my music just to see what I've been missing.",5
"These are a great pair for the price, ~35 cheaper than the MDR7506I have just started listening to the V6s and have had the MDR7506s for a little over a year.Honestly, you get what you pay for most of the time, except for the MDR 7506 and V6 cans. They both are undeniable stars in the headphones scene.The difference between the V6 and MDR7506 is very small, but there is a difference, both in sound (maybe my V6s just need to break in, but I generally don't believe in the break in process for speakers)The MDR7506 from the very beginning were absolutely amazing. Very natural sounding, great ability to pick out little details in well recorded music. I loved listening to some of the Eagle's stuff on them, they have some crisp clean string sounds and well recorded drums. They are loose fitting on the ears somewhat, keeps your ears feeling free and comfortable. The cable is very good rubber, limber and returns to it's shape over a few minutes if left in a knot or stretched out.The V6s have an almost equally amazing sound, more bass response than the MDR7506. Seems that they lack (just very so slightly) the clarity of the MDR7506. Earpads are more of a matt finish and firmer than the 7506s. The cable on these is no doubt quality, and will last years under normal circumstances, but the 'nice' factor is not the same feel. The actual plug is just like that on the 7506, same screw on 1/4"" adapter, but the shell is nickel finished instead of black, and the contacts on the plug are nickel plated instead of gold plated. Nickel is actually preferable, against popular belief, because a majority of the jacks it will be plugged into in it's life will have nickel plated contacts, and dissimilar metals will corrode when touching. Not really a problem in a clean, dry studio, but the ideal thing is always to be kept in mind.In the end, if you're looking for good headphones for studio or engineering of some kind, go with the 7506, if you're doing an at home studio or just want bang for the buck to plug into your ipod, the V6s are where it's at.",5
"I have heard problems about knock-off MDR-V6's on this site, but this isn't one of them.  Build quality is very good.  Sounds amazing (my first pair of real cans).  My parents had just bought 2 pairs of Bose OE2's for $99, and both agreed that my cheaper V6's sound better! My only complaint is that the bass runs a bit thin for my tastes...but it is actually pretty accurate. These are not the bass-heavy Beats that sound best with rap music and not much else; the V6's sound amazing with everything from Classical to Rock to R&B; to Soul to Primus.My iPhone 4S drives them good enough to not &#34;need&#34; a headphone amplifier (but of course I still &#34;want&#34; one, LOL).  Be forewarned though; these cans reproduce the sound SO ACCURATELY that now, poorly-compressed MP3s now annoy the heck out of me.  I can even hear the difference between my 128kbps AAC's and my lossless ALAC files.  I finally had an excuse to re-rip a bunch of CDs into 256kbps AAC and/or ALAC now.Very comfortable, even for hours at a time.  I want to try the velvet ear pads just to see how they are, but the stock ones are still very comfortable.If you're on the fence, and you don't need a huge bottom end, these won't disappoint you.",4
"I originally bought these headphones to go with our digital piano, but my wife didn't see any need for them, so they became my computer headphones. Darn :DI want to start out by pointing out that these headphones have a very soft feel on the head, yet are firm enough to not fall off. Sound quality is extremely important to me, not just blasting bass or highs or anything. These have excellent fidelity. You can hear the highs, the lows, and the mids very clearly on this set, and one is not overpowered by the others. One thing I have noticed about lower-end headphones is the fact that when you have too many things going on in music (or games, or movies) some parts start to literally get lost as the headphones simply cannot handle that many streams simultaneously. These headphones do not have that problem. After reading the reviews from people who have enjoyed theirs for ten to twenty years, I look forward to a long relationship with these.I listen to a wide variety of music, and everything from Linkin Park to Mozart sounds great on these headphones, as well as a wide variety of PC games ranging from thrillers where hearing clearly is essential to survival, to FPS games with explosions and gunshots. I have noticed with these phones, I feel like I have my 5.1 system on, and have to take them off to ensure I am not being obnoxious to my neighbors, only to learn that it is simply the quality of the headphones that I am hearing. The same thing happened with our digital piano, I thought I was hearing the piano outside of my headphones as well as inside them, but that was not the case. Anyone who is disappointed by these either has ridiculous expectations, or they do not know what sound quality is.Update 2/15/2013So, I wanted to get on here and make another comment on the comfort and noise reduction. I have put them on when I sat down at my computer, only to realize an hour later I was still wearing them, and not listening to any music. They are comfortable enough to forget that they are on, and the are noise cancelling enough that they literally cut the noise levels in the room in half. I continue to love them.",5
"I had a pair of Sennheiser HD 208's i believe, man these things DESTROY them. First of all they aren't tight, at least on my head, so they rest comfortably. Second the sound quality is AMAZING! no wonder they've had these cans selling for decades! if you have an eq on your pc, then you can raise the bass a little if you're feeling frisky (lol). I use them for some mxing and casual listening and they're great so far! Anyway with that said these headphones are great and at $50 (when i bought it) they rival a lot foof the higher end headphone! Definitely in my recommendation for a good set of headphones!!",5
"another positive review for this, surprising it's relatively cheap compared to other budget headphones. nothing more to add than what's already said, this one is definately one to add to your collection, even if this is the only one in your collection",5
"These headphones are great! They give what some people call a flat sound...just the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo. In other words no excentuated highs, basses or midrange. They are ruggedly constructed for professional use. They are also pretty comfortable with one slight drawback. The plastic padding around each phone fits so snugly around my ears that my ears eventualy get a little too warm.Buy them. You wont be sorry.",5
I bought these headphones to use at home and at church.  I am involved in the multimedia ministry at my church and these really do a great job.  You won't be disappointed if you get them.,5
"First bought these back in 1995 along with a Sony diskman with my first paycheck. These headphones have been used along with my Sony Diskman, iPods (gen 1, 3 and 6), home stereo and gaming pc's since I got them. It has outlived most of the tech I had plugged them into and kept on kicking until a friend stole them. Bought a replacement pair in 2009 on Amazon and just got around to reviewing them.These headphones sound great when I first bought them and still do now. They opened my ears to cleaner sounds when listening to music that default electronic headphones don't pick up.I have taken these with me while riding the bus, long car trips and on the airplane. They can be compacted to be taken on the go and stuffed in a bag. So they are very portable even come with a leatherish bag to be carried in. They are very comfortable enough to be worn for extended periods of time. Even taken long naps and slept with them over night. They do make your head warm after extended hours of use but that goes for any over the ear headphones. They are very adjustable you can wear them on one ear and the other behind the head and wont fell like your head is in a vice.Only problem I ever had with them is that the earpads start to flake off after a while. But you can get replacement pads that don't flake. But I cant knock the rating down for that since I had these for such a long time and since it has outlived several gaming headsets just to get plugged back in.",5
"so sweet and sublime, there isn't anything here that shouldn't be.  great separation and pure, rich sound as it was intended.  awesome, flavored with old-school cool.  buy a pair and find out for yourself.  rock on.",5
"I spend at least 10 hours a week in these mixing music professionally.  I've owned mine since the late 80s and have two pair: one for home and one for work.  I've replaced the earpads about every 8 years.These are quite simply one of the best ten products I've ever owned.  The sound quality is unparalleled.  They are efficient enough to be driven loud from a computer or an ipod.  I have a super large head and these are very comfortable.  Those of you complaining they are too tight don't understand how to adjust them - pull the earpieces down if they are too tight.I've never found a better pair at any price.  The fact that these are under $100, last essentially forever, and sound superb, is a modern miracle.Flat frequency response as high as any human ear can hear and lower than most any equipment can produce, and yet the sound is pleasing from just about any source.Buy a pair of them without hesitation.  You'll never regret it.",5
"I am not an expert on this but based on the quality of the output sound, I would definitely recommend these. I also have sennheisers at the same price and I felt Sony this was better than those head headphones. They are very comfortable on your head and you can wear them for hours without any problem. They look very good and come with a very nice leather pouch and nice packing.",4
"I've bought two pairs of these now, only because one was a gift to my Dad.  They're the best sounding I've used for the budget (and budgets hundreds higher).  Just know the ear pad will start to fall apart after awhile, I think it was around two years for me.",5
"Bought these because of their range.  Glad I did.  Only problem I have is the cord.  It may be 10 feet long but because it's coiled you really are limited to where you can go.  Go too far and out comes the plug or down goes the stereo.  Just need to limit your range.  No biggie.  I just move the chair closer to the stereo.Also, the cushions are fit just right around my ears where they do a good job of blocking out outside noises.",5
"These are, by far, the best headphones I've ever owned.  Sony got it right when they invented the MDR-V6's, and that's why they've stayed pretty much the same (even the packaging) for about 30 years.  I'd recommend them to anyone.",5
"and terrific sound. You don't need to spend $200+ on the good doctor's  prescription :). These are a very wise, economical, and sound worthy choice.",5
"The headphones sound fine, they are comfortable enough -- but this cord is  a deal-breaker. As other reviewers have noted, it is very heavy due to its substantial coiling -- and as a result it will not comfortably rest on any surface yet cannot be left dangling because it is too heavy! Maybe an example would suffice... if I plug these into my Mac Tower while sitting at my desk, the cord is too short to not start engaging the coils -- which produces tension and then tugs on the headphones -- eventually causing the plug to pop out of the computer. ANNOYING. What's worse is that the cord refuses to rest on he desk either without sliding off because (once again) it is too short and the coils are too heavy. I have to secure it down which is harder than it might seem without duct tape, plus it really restricts my movement.For this alone, I would recommend another set.",3
"Based on all the recommendations on Amazon and around the Internet, this was the best model at my target price. The product actually exceeded my expectations. The sound is superior and the headset is very comfortable. As expected, Sony has not had to update this model for years because you can't improve upon perfection at this price point.",5
"I like this headset, sound quality was great!Note:Cord is long.. No I mean really Long...It has an adapter for the large audio jackThey are adjustable for sizeThe ear pads are nice and soft",5
These have become the preferred headphones of choice for tracking. I wasn't expecting much when I picked up a pair of these on Black Friday for $40. I've had numerous people google these after using them to see where they can get them in town quicker. These are the real deal.,5
"It's not a solid 5 star, BUT it still deserves it. At this price, the sound quality is wonderful. I did burn-in with an app on android, using pink noise. Before the burn-in, the sound is good but not smooth enough. Now it just sounds right. The sound is much smoother. Good build quality. Nicely packaged. A decent leather bag is included.Now the CONS or insufficiency:1. don't expect light weight but it is ok;2. cable is ""telephone wire"", maybe good for moving around in studio, but ugly and unnecessary for other use;3. the can doesn't hug your head tightly. It is comfy for home use but you probably can't go commuting unless you walk smoothly like a snail.Overall, a great quality headphone for the price. Try it with flac/ape against other can, you will feel the great sound quality.",5
"Good set of cans for mixing and hearing they sound as it was recorded. If you want something for recreational music listening, these might not be for you thought I don't see why these couldn't be used for that. These have a good rep for a reasonable priced headphone for audio mixers etc.",4
"I purchased these on Black Friday, I use them for my Ipod Touch 4th Generation. The sound these produce completely removed the need to use any EQ settings on my IPod.I mostly listen to Pop, Rock, and Rap so I can say Highs are great, Mids are good, bass is excellent and clear,and no noise distortion.I can't speak to how well the build of the Headphones will last overtime, but so far they seem durable.They are a good choice if you plan on owning a HIGH QUALITY or audiophile version of headphones.The only thing I absolutely HATE is the LONGGGGGGG CABLE. I can't work it with it, it dangles over my legs,jumps up and down with me. If Sony could make a short version cable these would easily destroy, Beats, Souls, Audio Technica and all of the otherhighly marketed headphones.",5
"I just bought these trying to save a little money over the MDR7506. I have used the 7506 headphones for probably 20 some years now, replacing them when the earcups started to break down(this is my third set). I listen every day to speakers and headphones. I now have both models and can compare them. In my opinion(and please no hate mail) I think the 7506's sound better. They are slightly clearer and produce more air if you know what I mean. Bass is good on both but once again i think it is slightly cleaner with the pro phones. One writer mentioned about the gold plating wearing off of the connector. I plug my phones in and out all the time (for years) and the connector still looks perfect. No wear at all!!. maybe that coonector has something to do with the sound difference. I dont know but if i had to do it all over again I would spend the extra money and buy the MDR 7506. Dont get me worng. the v6 is a good phone but for my ears the other set is the way to go.",4
"Santa brought me these after I had done some extensive research. I've always been content spending a little extra money for quality and peace of mind; these headphones are one of the rare occurrences when you can get an incredible product at an extremely reasonable price. Lightweight, comfortable and sturdily built headphones with an incredibly balanced sound. Bass is very accurate and complements vocals and instruments nicely. Find myself wearing these for hours on end with no irritation, although clearly head and ear shape vary greatly, the MDR-V6 will be a steady companion of mine for the foreseeable future.",5
"The sound that these headphones reproduces is simply amazing. Right away I was astonished by the vast details, crisp vocals and all the little details that was intended to be heard by the artist!For under $100, this is one of the best in that price range, it even sounds better than some higher priced headphones!This definitely sounds better than my Beats, and Bose headphones!These headphones are also very comfortable, feels much more durable than Beats and Bose.Based on other reviews, it seems that these headphones will last a long time!Buy it, don't hesitate, you won't regret it! :)",5
"Hello, This is my first review for the Sony MDR-V6 with CCAW Voice Coil.SoundFirst I would like to mention that these headphones sound pretty amazing. I've had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble, but for me its very well balanced. The only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it, it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges. Some people mentioned about a &#34;boomy bass&#34; and I disagree. I think the bass is completely fine (I still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though). I like bass a lot and I put my iPod with Bass Boost and it still sounds fine without being &#34;boomy&#34; or &#34;vibrating.&#34; I listened with my galaxy s4 and that sounded fine as well.ComfortSome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable. For me, It was pretty comfortable, but not as comfortable as I thought. At first, it's going to hurt the top of your head for a bit, but after you wear it for a couple of days the uncomfortable-ness goes away. Right now after 1 week, I don't complain about the headband at all. Just like any other over-ears it does get sweaty a bit, so don't wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time :P.BuildThe build is pretty solid, but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap, but its not much to complain about. It's well built overall and it's portable which is a plus for me.AccessoriesIt comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in, which is pretty nice and unexpected. Also it comes with a 1/4&#34; screw on. Problem I had with this screw on is that when I took it back out, for whatever reason the 1/8&#34; connector bent in the middle slightly (maybe because I screwed it on too tight or something.) I just bent it back with the 1/4&#34; adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fine.OtherAnother thing I noticed was that the cable end doesn't really fit well into my s4 when it has its case on. I have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in. Because it's also with a metal end(which makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one) I sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s4. But if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in. I wish the 1/8&#34; was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldn't have to be shoved in.Pros:- Great sound quality. For the most part balanced.- It's actually quite comfortable once you get used to it.- It's portable- It has the coiled wire so it doesn't tangle so easily- It comes with a convenient 1/4&#34; cable. I use it for my P-155 Yamaha Digital Piano.- It doesn't squish your ears, but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones.- Solid Metal endingCons:- High range in treble can get screechy (but that's if you go really high)- It is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head.- The wire is a little bit too long.- The metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the iPod or your phone.tl;dr: it's very good product for headphones under $100.",4
"I record interview audio for video/DSLR shoots professionally. My go-to system begins with a Sennheiser MKH416-T short shotgun mic into a Sound Devices 302 mixer (which can power the T-power mic), the line-in into a JuicedLink RM222 then into a Nikon D800, then recording to the HDMI output to an Atomos Ninja.To monitor, I plug my trusty MDRV6's into the monitor out of the 302 mixer, which is listening via its return to the headphone output of the Nikon. With a knob turn, I can then listen to any of the mixer's three inputs directly or to the camera's return confidence feed.If it sounds good in the Sony MDRV6's, it'll sound good in the edit.Yes, there are way more expensive headphones, but I know how the MDRV6's sound, I trust them, and they never break.The biggest problem is coworkers &#34;borrowing&#34; them and not returning them. Write your name on them in large letters.",5
"I just picked up a set at Fry's at lunch, and agree with the others here that they are comfortable and sound very good. Unfortunately, the soft earcups are very susceptible to any little noise source, including movement of eyeglass frames and touching/scratching your cheek. I really wish that stores would have headphones on display so that you could find things like this out at the store. I also think that the earcups will get hot and sweaty with extended use. So far the Bose TriPorts are the only units that I have found that are comfortable and don't create this noise from rubbing, but I don't particularly like their sound, plus they cost twice what these do.",4
"Great quality in sound and are quite durable. We use a pair at work to monitor Camera sound during interviews and it blocks exterior noise well without completely blocking off sound so you can still hear your fellow crew.Folds down to a manageable size, and comes with a cheapo leather pouch that does the job. For the $60 or so bucks I paid for it I really can't find anything wrong with it or any reason to go for a more expensive model.If you want Beats headphones, take the stickers off the side and use a white sharpie and write a B.Good set of features for the price for sure.",5
"Everywhere you find quality reviews of these headphones (including audiophile sites), the V6 ranks highly.  They sound great for all kinds of music as well as for monitoring audio during video editing.  Probably not suited for audio mixing as these phones are made for great sound, not the sort of flat response you'd probably want for mixing.These phones sit on top of my ears, and as other reviewers have noted, they can get a bit warm and little too snug after a couple hours of wearing them.  However, I don't wear them too long in any one sitting, so it doesn't bother me.",5
"Bought for my daughter for her sound engineering class.  They are versatile (2 types of connection) for home and studio.  Great sound high and low frequency and buffer ambient sound pretty well.  Highly recommend. Not the best money can buy, but a good deal.",5
"Have you been considering good headphones? Have you searched the net and Head-Fi looking for advice? Look no further. If you want open headphones, choose the Sennheiser PX100 or Grado SR60 or SR80. IF you want closed, there is no better choice under $150 than the MDR-V6. Beware the other Sony models - they have a few good ones, but most are not so good, even a few that are pricier than this one. This is the same headphone (except for cosmetics) as the MDR-7506-great sound-easy to drive with or without an amp-durable-comfortableDo not hesitate - you won't regret these!Update 6/2010:These are still great, but Shure has since introduced two models (the SRH-440 and 840) that are very nice and worth a listen, some will certainly prefer them to the Sony. The 440 is very close in price as well. Also worth considering is the Denon AH-D1000 and D-1001, which when on sale are around $100. The Denons have great sound, perhaps slighlty more appealing to me than the Sony, but the Denon has absolutely the best comfort in any headphone that sounds decent and is under $500. The Sony wins on ruggedness and value, though, and the sound isn't worlds apart...",5
"For studio monitoring, you can't go wrong with these. The Sennheiser HD 280 pro, are a heftier, build, have a flatter response, and all parts are replaceable, but it's good to have more than one tool in this area. This being my second pair of Sony MDR-V6, my son destroyed my original pair in an electronic music class, after he ""borrowed"" them, I found sonically, I was missing something by just using the Sennhiesers. The Sony's have deeper bass and an extended high end, which makes them more ""musical"". The quality for the price can not be beat. In fact for listening to music, I would recommend these, over any other headphone under $100.00. You have to trust so many positive reviews, these are classics!Addendum 12/4/2011I added the Beyer Dynamic Padded ear cushions, and these headphones are a lot more comfortable. I noticed immediately, that the bass response went way up, maybe not such a good thing for critical monitoring and mixing. I'm just wondering why? I did notice when I took the original Sony pads off, there is an additional layer, albeit thin, of foam, behind the velour. Perhaps this is why. Also as often discussed, headphones get a sweeter sound after about a 60 to 90 hour ""break in"" period. The Sony's definitely get smoother with age.",5
"These headphones are amazing. The sound quality is great. Neutral to some extent. The bass is true, the mid-range is strong, and the treble is clear. The supplied 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch adapter lets you use your headphones on your home theater set-up. These headphones can really handle all the power from your amplifier and can actually benefit when you start adjusting the sound.The stock earpads are okay. I bought the Beyerdynamic Pads which are way more comfortable than the supplied ones. Plus, they add a bit more bass, which is great.These cans have the reputation of being extremely tough. I can't really say much about that, since I've owned them for a couple of months barely. But I'm hoping to get some years from these.",5
GOOD value for the money. Very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periods.,5
"I find myself in agreement with almost everyone else. I lay no claim to having an educated ear, but I have anyone's subjective ability to distinguish better sound quality from not so good sound quality. These headphones are definitely in the ""better"" category.I bought these 'phones to wear during keyboard practice so I wouldn't annoy others in the room. I quickly found they were so good that I started plugging them into the laptop when I wanted to watch a flick or listen to something on line. I imagine they will replace every other pair or headphones or earbuds in the house.I don't have comfort issues with them, but am sometimes annoyed at their tendency to fold up when I take them off for a moment. I'd rather fold my own headphones, thank you, not have a spring system do it for me.Old guy alert: I'm closer to 70 than 60, and I have the usual age-related high-end hearing deficiency. In the real world I can barely hear the top two or three notes on a piano. Through these headphones the tones are still faint, but clearer. I take that to mean that the over-ear pads are screening out some of the aural clutter that will bury all but the loudest high tones for me.All in all, very satisfied.",5
"I like these headphones a lot. It's been years since I've had over-the-ear headphones and there's no comparison in both comfort and sound vs earbuds. These are like being in concert. The MDR-V6's have a nice, neutral sound, meaning they're not overly base heavy but more realistic to what natural sound would be. The cord is coiled and doesn't detach from the headset. So for those who want everything to come apart these wouldn't do it. I use them primarily to listen to music when I'm using my computer and sometimes when I'm playing something I haven't heard in a while, like YES, I just have to stop and appreciate the music again. Wonderful experience.",4
"These are well made headphones and have excellent response in the mid to high end frequencies but come up just a little short in the deep bass response. I did try them with several different sources. I listen to pretty much everything  classic, counrty, folk, rock, you name it( not much on rap or techno ). Compared to my Harmon Kardon and Pioneer speakers  or even cheap Skull Candy earbuds these headphones just didn't cut it for bass.",3
"I was really hoping that these would provide super-flat sound reproduction.  I was pretty disappointed when I plugged them in for the first time.  I got a second opinion from my brother, and he didn't have anything nice to say about them either.They have a particular warm sound that some people may appreciate, but it's like have a built-in EQ on the headphones that you can never change.  I personally like flat-sounding speakers (e.g. B&W;, and I like Denon receivers for this reason) and in this category the V6s don't perform well at all.Another problem: I am picky about comfort.  These headphones were not comfortable for me at all.  I could wear them for about 1 hour before I absolutely had to take them off.I am picky about my headphones, so I gave these to my friend and I'm still on the prowl for a better set.  I have since listened to the V600s, and I prefer the V600s to these (although I'm still not sure if I will settle on the V600s).One more thought: and anybody saying that these have no bass is out of their mind!",3
"I bought 3 different sets of headphones and this is the set I ended up keeping.  These are comfy, sound great, and feel like they will stand up to my daily uses.  Did i mention they sound awesome?>",5
"Over 20 years ago, I had started working at Circuit City and I wanted to buy a good pair of headphones, especially since I got an employee discount of store cost.  :-)  I tried on all the headphones on the rack, not listening to anything; I just snapped my fingers and listened to how well each headphone muffled the sound.  The Sony MDR-V6 pair did the best job.  Based on that, I bought them.  Imagine my shock when I listened to them and realized that they gave me better sound than my actual speakers did!  Over the 20 years since then, the padding disintegrated, and in my last move, they got... um.  A bit crunched.  I was heartbroken, as I remember Sony replacing the V6 with a far lesser pair of V600 headphones.  They had (I thought) renamed the V6 and tripled the price.  Not so, apparently!  I found my current pair of V6s right here on Amazon for the exact price I'd paid for them (at cost, remember) back in 1987!! (9/20/13 Edit: I bought them for sixty dollars both times; I've seen them go 50% higher on Amazon, but as long as they are less than a hundred, they are still worth it.)If you have any desire to hear your music without distraction, if you want the headphones that professionals use, if you want to have sounds coming at you that you cannot even *hear* but more feel, then buy these headphones!The sound quality is unparalleled in its price range.  Even going double or triple the price does not guarantee you a better pair of headphones, but there are some at higher prices.  Point is, you don't need to go that high for top-quality 'phones.  The 10-foot cord may seem like overkill, but when you need to get up from your chair to close that window, or answer the phone you left on the cradle on the other side of the room, or to look out the front window to see whatever, you will appreciate not being tethered.  Those ten feet equal freedom of movement that couples with phenomenal sound.The phones even let you do that little thing you see professionals do in those shows, where they flip an earpiece over and hold it up to their ear without putting the band over their head!  Or, flip one *while* it's over your head to enable a friend to listen to what you're listening to!I have read some people saying that these phones are uncomfortable.  I cannot imagine how that is possible.  The padding is quite comfortable (if short-lived in the earpads), and they manage to be snug without being constricting.These are, of course, NOT headphones to be worn while exercising unless you really want your ear pads soaked in sweat.  But that aside, these honest-to-goodness studio monitors will faithfully reproduce any sound you can throw at them, and never give you distortion from having the music turned up too loud.  You may go deaf from it....  But it won't be distorted!  :-)",5
"I love these, I went through a couple of headphones before I found these and I had planned to try as many as possible Until I found the ones I was completely happy with, well I stopped. I tried the JVC Black Series and a couple of Bose and none of them sounded like what I was looking for, not that they where bad, just not what I was looking for. These sound exactly like what I had in mind, the sound is very clear and crisp, I'm hearing parts of my music that I never even knew where there. I listen to a Lot of different Genres; Rap, R&B, Rock, and Hip Hop to name a few. Everything sounds great, the only thing about these is that if your looking for Thumping Bass these aren't for you, Not that they don't have Bass, its just not thumping Bass but Definitely there. Before you go and spend over a $100 on Bose or anything else I would give these a look, you won't regret it.",5
"The quality of sound from these phones is fantastic. Easily set-up, wonderful sound.Thanks.",5
"If you want better sound get the 50mm versions (MDR6506?).  Anyway, this is what we use in professional studios. Aint nothing expensive to buy.  How do you like that?This is what the record you are listening to was mastered with!",5
"I have tested Bose Around Ear Headphones (not the noise canceling version) and my Sony MDR-V6 beat Bose by far!Bose got a softer cushion and better response in the very low frequency at 16Hz, but Sony are far more consistent with the output level throughout the entire response range.20-20000 hz on Sony sound all at almost the same level - very nice flat response Sony have indeed. It will let you hear all the things in your tracks the good and the bad of mastering - you can hear them all on Sony's. But with Bose the bass will sound better and that is it - nothing else!I am so happy I got the MDR-V6 instead of Bose! (When I got my Sony both were almost same price.)",5
"I'm listening to Linda Ronstadt singing, Someone to Watch Over Me, as I write this. The sound is clear. There is no overbearing bass, just enough, the high notes sparkle like NYE champagne, and, Linda's Voice is wonderful, fantastic. The headphones don't get in the way of the music.",4
"I ordered my Sony MDR-v6 on November 24, 2012 sold by Amazon and received them Monday December 3, 2012 with free super shipping.The reason for my purchase of this is because of the large amount of positive reviews.my initial reaction to this headphone was ""Ouch"" because it has a higher response to treble than my last headphoneand what it has excess in for treble, it lacks in bass. I really expected more bass, I can even crank up the lowerband of my EQ and it still hasn't got enough kick to my liking.but after a few days of listening, my ears adapted.Many people believe there is a headphone ""burn in"" but I believe this to be personal hearing adapting to the sound.the sound is okay, it's nothing mind-blowing, my Sentry 880CD headphone (which cost far less) sound just as good as this (if not better)the reason I say ""If not better"" is because the Sony MDR-V6 has a quiet, but noticeable hissing sound at all times,even when there is no music playing, my Sentry do not exhibit this quality.in fact, I would rather have purchased Sentry 880CD again instead of this, my expectations were too high due to the over-exaggerated reviews of others.The Sony do have better isolation than the Sentry, but I am not worried if others hear my music.the clamping force is not as tight as desired or expected, many of the reviews claim it's too tight. This was another factor in why I made my purchase,I wanted tight headphones because the tighter they are, the better they sound. This headphone slopes down and the band rests uncomfortably on the top of my head.all-in-all I am not completely disappointed in this purchase, the Sony MDR-V6 headphone does sound good, but it is not as other exaggerated reviews would have you believe.",4
"Very good sound and base.  Relatively comfortable but do tend to squish my head after a while,Only real complaint is they bleed sound.  You ever sat net to someone that had their headphones not blaring, but still a bit loud and you could really hear them clearly?  Yeah, I don't like that either.  I've owned other big headphones like this that did a good job of sealing in the music so that everyone around them didn't have to listen to it too.  These don't do that.  The sound is great for me, but my wife complains all the time that they're disturbing her.Other than that, good headphones for the price.",4
"After many headphones I found these and they sound WONDERFUL!! the frequency response of 5 Hz - 30 kHz!!!!!!Unless you are going to spend many hundreds more for studio monitor headphones, don't hesitate purchasing these!!If purchasing for a very discerning ear these sound as good or better than the Bose line that costs twice as much.Bottom line is -- THESE DO NOT SUCK!!!!!But months later,.... NOW IT HAS A BUZZ IN THE RIGHT EAR AND I AM F___ED!!",1
have tried jvc and others but sony is THE BEST for home recording studio and other uses including watching shows,5
"Bought these head phones for my wife. She uses them when she flies, they fold up nice and they have better sound quality  than the ones i have that are a lot more expensive. Next ones i buy will be the sony's",5
"I've had these headphones for six months and have been very pleased with my investment.  I use them at work and they are very comfortable and the sound is of very high quality, much better than the earbuds I was using before.  The included carrying case is another bonus, as is the folding design which makes these headphones portable enough to take on a plane.",5
"The classic Sony MDR-CD6 headphones that I got back in 1988--held together with duct tape, string and super glue--finally fell apart after 24 years of use--and countless ear pad replacements. I used other brands and Sony models over the years and nothing came close to this--uncolored, accurate sound and especially its tight--not exaggerated--bass response. Until I discovered the MDR-V6, which I've heard has been around almost as long as the MDR-CD6. The only difference is that the MDR-V6 is more comfortable as it completely encloses my ears (the MDR-CD6 pads were smaller and rested on my ears, not around them). This is an excellent value for the money.",5
"I have always had a pair of headphones, usually purchased at Best Buy or something similar. I used to think price= quality. Turns out in the audio universe, that just isn't true. These headphones are really great for the price, and even for a $150 pair of headphones.Look, bottom line is: these are marvelous headphones. But connected to your laptop or other digital source, you will be missing out on SO MUCH audio quality. Everything either needs to be analog, or you need a semi high-quality USB DAC. Do some research, because given the proper signals, these headphones will really blow your mind. And take all these reviews with a grain of salt. One reviewer might be basing their review on what they sound like on an iPod and another might be reviewing on a $10k audiophile setup.",5
"I love music and demand great sound quality in my headphones. With that said... The MDR-V6 Monitor Headphones are the stuff of Legend. They've been making these babies for well over a decade, and as far as I know their quality has always stayed true.  They have stood the test of time, and will give you the most ""bang for buck"" compared to any other model. And when you see how these are packaged, you'll see that Sony still has much pride in their product. There are so many reasons why I think these headphones are a true ""Classic"", but I don't want to re-iterate what thousands (if not millions) have already said about these through the years.  If you're in the market for Great Monitor Headphones (for a very reasonable price), don't hesitate to buy these. You won't be disappointed.Pros:-Amazing and Balanced Sound-For what you're getting, these headphones are truly a great value.-Long cord 10 foot cord.-large headphone adapter included.-Great build quality, they should last you for many years... and even then, you'll probably only need to change the ear pads.Cons:-None (except that I wish they were indestructible... but that's not gonna happen (and unrealistic :)",5
I've had other headphones around this price range in the past but they did not come close to how great this set of cans sound. I did my research and just wanted for this baby to go on sale and I wasn't left hanging. The sound is sharp and clear and just enough bass for me. I'm not really into how the Beats headphone are so overpowering when it comes to bass but that's just me. If you want to hear all the detail in the music at a reasonable price this will not disappoint : ) !! I once had bad headphones but now I hear !! Taking this to church.,5
"NOTE: These headphones are in every way the same as the MDR-7506's, well-loved headphones for studio work.  Even the replacement part #'s are exactly the same.  So this review is for either one (I bought both).Anyone who has been listening to music on normal street headphones will be blown away by these.  The first thing you notice is how soft and comfortable they are to wear - the earcups surround your ears, leaving no pressure on the ears themselves.  Then, when the music starts, you notice:1) background noise is blocked out2) bass is full and punchy, not muddy, boomy, or distorted3) every detail shines through4) the music is LOUD for the given volume settingHere are my comments on these four aspects:1) background noise is blocked outBecause these headphones surround your ears and are ""closed back,"" they really do diminish outside noise.  It's nothing like the Bose active noise-cancelling headphones, though - these ones just turn down the volume on outside noise rather than pulling the plug on it.  This is on purpose - many headphone designers feel that active noise cancellation discolors the sound too much.2) bass is full and punchy, not muddy, boomy, or distortedThe drivers are big on these, and the CCAW coils let them draw power when they need it without getting muddy.  If you do hear distortion, it's probably that your player can't dish up enough power, so try switching to a good amp.  My portable CD players works fine though, and I hear ipods do too.3) every detail shines throughThese headphones are really detailed, meaning they reproduce high mids and trebles well.  You will probably hear things you've never heard before like breaths, guitar fretboard noises, and string instruments.  However, this makes you feel like you're right in the middle of everything, and it can get tiring after an hour or two.4) the music is LOUD for the given volume settingThe impedance on these is lower than most headphones, which means that for a given voltage these will draw more current and hence sound louder.  However, power is power, and your battery only has so much of it.  So these don't necessarily extend battery life, they just give you more options for how quickly to use it.For comparison, I also own the Sennheiser HD 201, 280Pro, and 595.  All are more soothing (less bright) while retaining the detail.  The 201's don't match the bass or noise dampening of the V6's.  The 280Pro's don't have quite the same bass (still great!), are much less comfortable, but block noise better and sound sweeter.  The 595's are superior to the V6's in every way (bass accuracy, sweetness, comfort) except that they intentionally don't block out noise at all and require a good amp to sound their best.  (Plus they cost almost twice as much as the V6's.)In summary, you'd be hard pressed to find a better price/performance/comfort balance than the V6's.  Try the HD 201's first for classical or instrumental music (they only cost $20, so trust me, try them!), but if you want noise dampening and/or punchy bass, don't hesitate to grab a pair of these.",4
"I did very well this past Christmas season.  I added theSennheiser HD-555and Sony MDR-V6 to my collection of headphones.  I intended to keep both because I was going to use them differently.  I got the Sennheiser HD-555 mainly for movies and the MDR-V6 for music.  Unfortunately, I had to send one of them back.PROS:- High quality build- Folds compactly- Fairly comfortable- Out of this world frequency range- Nice bass- Love the coiled cord- Includes carry pouchCONS:- Highs were harsh for meFirst off, I burned in both sets of headphones for about 2 straight days.  I then spent about 4 hours comparing both headphones with a variety of sources.  My intention wasn't to eliminate one but just to compare them since they were both nice headphones.Right away I noticed that the bass response on the MDR-V6 was much better.  Listening to rap, techno, trance, and synthpop was much more fun on the MDR-V6 than on the HD-555.  After a couple of hours, I started to notice I was turning the volume down on the MDR-V6 because it was causing discomfort.  However, I realized that it wasn't the volume, but that the highs in some of the music I was listening to were just harsh.  Too harsh.  The MDR-V6 is more than likely reproducing the highs accurately, but the trade-off is that some music was just too fatiguing to listen to.  Red Hot Chili Peppers just killed me!  If I hadn't been comparing them to the HD-555 I may not have noticed it.  I think I am in the minority of users who have an intolerance to those higher frequencies.  I was disappointed to have to send them back.  By the way, my source material were Lame VBR encoded MP3's, some FLAC encoded music files, and DVD movies.On the flip side, I felt that the actual physical comfort of the headband and ear cups were quite reasonable.  The pressure was not nearly as intense as theSennheiser HD-280 Pro.  The coiled cord, compact folding, carry pouch, and durability were all things I found to be very positive.I am not saying that the Sony MDR-V6 will be harsh for everyone.  I believe I actually have a heightened sensitivity to higher frequencies for some reason so it might just be me.  But if you get them and feel your ear drums ache, you may be experiencing the same issue I did.  A vast majority of users who have purchased them seem to have great success with them.  In fact, I recommend everyone at least try them.  They are an amazing deal on Amazon for legendary cans.",3
I use this to listen to music on my mp3 player at work.  The sound is good but after about an hour my ears begin to hurt and I have to take it off.,3
I tried many different headphones looking for flat response and detailed sound. I also did not want to pay hundreds of dollars. These are the one. These excel from low to high frequencies. Bass is full but not overwhelming. Highs are exceptionally detailed. Mids are just right. I can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue. One will not find such high quality headphones for this price. Other Sony slightly cheaper studio headphones (MDR-V250V) are terrible. More expensive are not better. These are just right.,5
"Did research on headphones and have a few friends who are audiophiles (Dj's, gamer audiophiles and musicians). About this reviewers references.. Been listening to music since 1983.. have had my share of ear accessories - aiwa, sony, koss, sennhieser, random studio recording headphones (no idea what they were) and would say these mdr-v6's are good, but not great.. Sound clarity is definitely it's strength.  Everyone is going to have a personal opinion and mine is that these cans can be listened to for hours.  I'm shocked to have read that folks thought these were too bassy.  I'm on the other side of the fence.  I think however I'm all for basslines woven in with highs..  I suggest if anyone wants to test these cans should try their test on various media to get more out of their experience with these headphones.  So far they really can tell a poor mp3 over a larger audio file on itunes.  These are going to be used for personal enjoyment not for a professional studio.  I may try these cans on my dj friends equipment, but really don't want to take them anywhere but home.. yet these are transportable.About the comfort= my ears are small.. they are about 2 inches in height and 1.5 in width and fit right into the ear cushions.  Perfect. I can't hear a thing outside nor inside my room.  They do get a little warm, but not an uncomfortable type of heat.. more like these things are growing on your head! Snug fit definitely.. still new.Durability= yes these are questions I would've liked to have known before purchasing headphones.  I was hoping that the two elbows that hold the cans themselves would be solid steel or metal.. to my dismay they are those plastic (break this and you got to buy a new one) elbows.  I wouldn't mind finding a good pair of headphones that had a metal elbow that would hold them.. that is usually where they break/or get the wire pulled.  Hey there is an idea for a headphone maker!! Headphones that last.. but would probably be less business for them.. (they'd have my money and my friends).  Yes so just like many headphones if you sit on these flush.. you will probably break that part of the headphone.. haven't tried it yet though and not wanting to.In the end I am quite pleased with these headphones..  I guess the only coupe de grace would be durability/bass.  I would still like to test these headphones on dj equipment and other formats.*Just picked up some problems on the selling point of these headphones given the impedance rating on these phones they should sound good on my itunes :(  was listening to Deadmau5 with the track STROBE and the highs start to crack and pop.. now I'm starting to get a better feel for these headphones.  They sound good for (rock) sound tested Van Halen 1984.  I guess for the price you get something good not amazing. Listening now.. and not getting that tingly feeling you get when you're *embraced* by the mids *touched* by the highs and *rocked* by the bass..I think these are good for an overall good experience.. nothing mind/body altering.",3
"Finding the right set of headphones to suit my taste for soundboard monitoring has been an issue ... until now. These are the real deal. The only point I give these four stars instead of the full five is the cord. It's long and somewhat bulky, but manageable. The sound reproduction, particularly at the bass end, is surprisingly good and the overall fit is perfect.Don't bother looking further. I've done it and tried most of them. I'd put these up against anything else, even more expensive brands, on the market.",5
"I have had dozens of headphones, these work well with my ipod.  I will leave sonic reviews to others, but I do not like booming and distorted bass, such as with the extremely overpriced (IMO) Beats headphones.  The V6 seems to be a good value with fairly flat response and reasonable sensitivity.I have a large head and these are comfortable to me. Sound isolation is good, much better than I thought it would be given the comfort and size.After reading about the pad wear, I will try periodic cleaning with a vinyl conditioner.  I ordered these with a coiled cord which is a heavier than a straight cord, so pay attention when ordering if cord type is important to you.",5
"I have a lot of headphones. And have had for many years. I have these, and love them. These are closed-ear, clinical, precise sounding cans. They are hot on your ears. They are harsh. They are good for mixing recordings because they consolidate a lot of listening experiences. When you're mixing music, you need to listen on a variety of sources, sources you expect your music to be heard on: iPod earbuds, car stereos, AM radios, Disco sound systems etc. These are great because they relentlessly show detail. If your mix sounds good on these things, it'll sound good on anything. BUT If you are looking for a comfortable, moving listening experience; check out Grado. Audiophile quality, rich and beautiful. Recordings mixed with these Sony's will sound spectacular on Grados. These are an incredible tool, but they are built for a purpose, and it's work, not pleasure.",3
"There's not much to say here others haven't said,  these are just fantastic neutral-sounding and comfortable headphones.If you want emphasized bass or crackling highs - especially in noisy places like outdoors and on public transit - these might sound too flat for you - you're going to want some MTX iX1's or something like that. If you prefer a softer, natural sound or if you are doing production work these are probably what you want.  They'll last you a long time in a studio or bedroom, too.",5
"Packaging is a little excessive but it does give the headphones a luxury feel. The headphones themselves are very comfortable even with the pleather. They're actually really compact compared to many cans at this price. Lows, mids and highs are all excellent for under $100. The build quality is nothing less than superb as expected, doesn't feel plasticy or vulnerable to breakage at all. Need time to break in these new cans but I can say that these are similar to the HD280s but the Sony's are more comfortable and less costly. I recommend these to anyone looking for affordable headphones for music or monitoring in general.",5
best headphones on earth. i actually confused some of the sounds on the records i was listening to for real sounds in my room. xD the bass really comes out and its so rich and distinct. it really had made me fall deeper in love with music.,5
"Headphones exist to provide a provide listening experience - so as not to blast other's with your music (or whatever) and to isolate the environment.I've had several headphones over the years - the Koss Pro4A, Sony MDR V150, and some miscellaneous in-ear types.The Koss Pro4A finally wore out, and I figured I would try something lighter.The MDR V150 was a good choice, comfortable, lightweight, and good fidelity (at least to my aging, too-many-years-on-a-flight-deck hearing) and aged gracefully if not well. The problems with the liner are well documented.However, my son grabbed them to wear when playing his online games and that was that.So, I went shopping for a new pair and decided to try the MDR V6.I'm impressed.Some reviewers consider them uncomfortably tight, but I'm fine, and I have a ""large head"". The cushions are reasonable soft and provide good isolation.It's the fidelity that blows me away for the price.  The volume is good (again, too many years on a carrier deck, I ""need"" volume) and the bass is smooth and rich without being obnoxious.  The higher frequencies are clear and sharp without abrasive characteristics.The adapter is the ""smaller"" 1/8"" that is common to iPads, phones, notebooks, etc. A bonus is a nice 1/4"" jack that doesn't just snap onto the smaller one but screws on tight!  Nice quality touch.For the price?  Excellent, and highly recommended.",5
"I bought the headphone a week ago. And i have no luck with headphones, these seem very good . costly but  is a great value. Here are my thoughts .They  look well made. The  weight for the headphones is not as heavy as some may think. I use them for hours daily.I even walk around with them. being a women i don,t like heavy weight. So i find the weight good. The ear pads are very soft, also replaceable  which you can't do with some. The fit is an over the ear .They look kind of big, but don't let that fool you. I am a women with small ears , they fit nicely . The cord is one sided , and thick. It also looks like a phone cord .I wish the cord was replaceable .  I don't think  I will need to replace Them . The length of the cord is longer than others . That is great for me because my CD player is on my book case near the couch. The sound is great even with the volume at low  sound. You don't need to put it that loud. The balance of the sound is well balanced. can fold them , which is great for draws. Lets talk pouches soft well made  with a drew string. I like pouches in my opinion . I hope this helps you make up your mind.",4
it's like a classic headphone but can beat many modern day headphone in terms of sound reproduction and quality.definitely won't regret owning this,5
"When I bought this, I thought I had bought a set of gold plated diamond necklace.  Sony packaged it like it was a limited edition.  I paid 50 bucks for headphones that were mediocre before and this is only around 75.  Very solid sound and great for monitoring, I thought about needing a 300 dollar pair of sennheiser but a colleague said you won't get more out of a more expensive set than this.  I'm not sure what's the difference between this and MDR7506 but I can only image how awesome the professional ones are though.",5
I am very pleased with the sound of these headphones. It is detailed and well-balanced across the frequency range. I am happy to listen for extended periods and the headphones are comfortable. I cannot comment on thumping deep bass because I listen to the wrong kind of music for that. I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago but gave them to a family member. This newer pair cost much less but sound every bit as good.On sound quality alone I would give these five stars but the construction is a bit concerning. Pulling on the extenders to lower the earcups feels as if it is pulling the headband apart. The old pair extended smoothly. I don't know if quality has gone down or I just got a wonky pair. Since I can leave the earcups extended this is not an ongoing problem but it does raise questions about overall quality. I haven't had any other similar issues so far.,4
"Extended frequency response for harmonics,  thus sound is crystal clear. Also bass response is excellent. Very comfortable on the head and ears. This phone does NOT eliminate ambient noise, nor is it designed to do so.",4
"I bought these for a trifecta purpose.1)  I can use them while recording music.2)  I can have over-the-ear cans to listen to my mp3's3)  So I can enjoy music again.I'm not single anymore (haven't been for a LONG time), and I don't have the set-up that I used to have in order to listen to music at the volume I enjoyed.  Nor do I drive my car often enough to be able to listen to much more than a few tracks at a time.  Then my wife complains if I turn my music up past 3 on the volume knob.  So I pretty much fell out of the music listening loop over the years.  Music was, and has been a huge part of my life, and I miss it.  Now, with these cans, I can lock myself in the basement, sit back, and be that dude on the old Memorex packaging being blown away in his chair.  These things make music sound SO much better than it does coming through any loudspeaker.  It's like you're right there with it.  These aren't even on the same playing field as earbuds, and those expensive Dre Beats headphones suck compared to these.  After comparing the two, I'm SO glad I didn't waste my money on Beats.  I will likely buy a few more pairs of these so I don't have to keep transferring them from one device to the next.  And I took the advice of other reviewers and picked up theBeyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions for DT250, DT280, Sony MDR7506 and V6 Headphones (Pair)to replace the ones that came on it.  They are much more comfortable and don't cause your ears to sweat nearly as bad as the ones that come on it.If you are a true music aficionado, you will not regret this purchase.",5
"Been kind of interested in adding another set of headphones to my collection. Mostly used for mostly music playback and some PC gaming. These headphones fit the bill. At their price, how can you beat these?Sound, these have a great sound. Just so you know where I'm coming from...I've been married to my Bose Triport headphones that I bought years ago. I paid $150 for those. Compared to those, soundwise, they're about even, with the edge going to the sturdier Sony's. The sound is excellent at the bottom, mid's and highs. I found the sound level to be even accross the sound field. Very flat. But flat in a good way, as these can produce very good lows, mids and highs. Not any one particular range dominated, which is perfect.Construction is without a doubt, excellent. These things will take a beating. The cushions are comfortable. I have a huge head and I found these to be fine. Not tight or uncomfortable.The only ding against this fine headset is the cord, it's long, thick and heavy. Not very portable. I wish there was a way to mod the wiring to put something like what Bose uses on these, then these would be PERFECT. I believe a different version of this headset has a more portable wire. 3.5mm jack is not compatible with iPhone's bumper case. Carrying case is thick and cheap looking.Overall, if you're a headset aficionado, I think you will appreciate these. A fine headset to add to the collection. Pass on the Beats by Dre, save money and enjoy.**UPDATE**10/21/2013**The cord was really getting to me, so I cut it. Big mistake. I was hoping to just splice the wiring and make the wire shorter, and manageable. When I went to cut the cord and strip the ends, I found these very thin wires. I believe they were L channel, R channel and ground. Well, when I went to touch the ends together and test, I got no audio whatsoever. GREAT, just killed a perfectly good set of headphones. Well, long story short, I was able to solder the ends together, insulate the solder with electrical tape and fix the headphones. Worked like a charm. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I lucked out. I thought this set was cooked for sure.",4
"I bought a pair for record monitoring about 20 years ago and liked them so much I bought a second set before they were discontinued.  The retailer I got them from is long gone but these babies are still available.  Not that I need them, they still function perfectly.  I keep one on the computer and one on the stereo.  They are not the best sounding cans I've heard as I own a set of Stax.  BUT they are the best monitors I've ever used.  A little hot/harsh above 10KHz but that's what you need to hear what you've got.  They can smell any clipping.  The Stax earpads have gotten flaky but these Sony's have aged well.  They get dropped, ripped off my head etc. all the time, no problem.  They fold up compactly in a travel pouch and plug into anything.  I wear them for hours comfortably.  I have other Sonys, Sennheisers, Beyers and others that I can't listen to anymore because of these.  There is no better value that I know of.",5
"It sounds great. And over the last year, It has proven to be quite sturdy. Easy to store in the bag that it comes with. I highly recommend it.",5
"Wonderful! The specs looked great. After receipt, I tried them out with my 5 Star iTunes playlist. I had been using Etymotics ear buds, but wanted a longer cord and an over the ear style. The Sony beat them hand downs. I had originally ordered a pair of Audio-Technica ($148.00). To me, the Audio-Technica muffled the bass sounds a bit and didn't give me the crisp highs that I had expected, or was used to. I returned those and ordered the Sony MDR-V6 (about $85), and couldn't be happier! Better than the Etymotic ear buds - solid bass - but not too much., and nice crisp highs. Also, they are a bit more comfortable than the Audio-Technica, and a lot less expensive! The Sony's are solid!",5
I was going to buy the professional alternative of these headphones so before I did I read some of the reviews and there wasn't much of a difference I believe the only difference was the 1/4 plug is gold plated and this one isn't but these headphones are worth every penny. I use it for video editing and they rock hard.,5
"I just got these recently after reading all the reviews here.  The others aren't lying, these headphones are unbelievable.  I find them extremely comfortable, and don't think they feel heavy like others have said.  The build quality is top notch, and feel like they could last for the 10-15 years that others' have.As far as the sound goes, they seem to do better with real music than fake.  Basically, if you're listening to classical, jazz, acoustic, vocals or classic rock, I can't imagine anything could ever reproduce sound better.  I've listened to Led Zeppelin for 20 years, and now I'm re-listening, hearing (and feeling) subtle sounds I never heard before.  They'll almost bring you to tears as you go back and listen to your favorite albums.Where they seem to fail is with fake music, such as rap, hip hop, or anything else created with synthesizers or computers.  If that sort of non-music is your thing, you may be better off with the Dre headphones.  If real music is what you listen to, you absolutely have to buy these.",5
"Great sound and comfortable! I have not experienced the discomfort many other reviewers mentioned as a con in their reviews. I use these with my high definition audio recorder, and can hear every detail. I've also used them to listen to music, and have found them to be quite a pleasure!If I were to nitpick, I'd say the coiled cord is a bit cumbersome due to its weight. If you're using this with a small device, such as I do with my Zoom H1 audio recorder, it will definitely need some care so it doesn't tip the device over or pull it off a table. Not a huge problem and not really a con for me.",5
"First of all, I was nearly dissuaded from purchasing these because of complaints about tightness. Anyone who says these are tight probably never wore real headphones before. Depending on how pampered your ears are you may need more padding but that's it. Sound quality is superior and the fact these fold up so nicely make them excellent if you travel. As long as Sony makes these I doubt I will buy another brand/model.",5
"I bought these headphones on Amazon for the great price of 50 bucks and let me tell you it was money well spent.  They sound fantastic and feel very comfortable after watching 2 hour long movies or listening to long music sessions while working around the house.Keep in mind, like most headphones, they require time to &#34;burn in.&#34; Out of the box the highs sounded off and bass was mediocre. After a week of listening the headphones sound fantastic and keep getting better. Remember this when purchasing these headphones. If you can get them for the 50 bucks I got them, then I promise you will enjoy the sound and the price!",5
Love these have done well and still have great sound and quality just as good as good if not better then the hip hop brands,5
"Sony MDR series headphones been always one of the best, no wonder many professional studios are using it! I use mine to play guitar at late and don't bother the neighbors. Once in a while the ear pad has to be replaced [B001DFX2OC",5
"An excellent product, the audio quality is commensurate with the cost. Its design is perfect and comfortable. I've used products like this headset PRO2 and for less money obtiee very similar performance.Excellent, I recommend it.",5
"I bought these on sale and after seeing the reviews. I don't do a whole much with these headphones but plug them into my iPhone to listen to podcasts and the weird music I have collected. It's hard to describe but these headphones are comfortable and they don't seem to get in the way at all, aurally.Headphones are so personal that I can't say these will be the best for you. They're not perfect for me; the cord pulls my iPhone off the table for example. But they're nice enough that they're what I use every day.",5
"Would have been 5 stars but after hours of wearing, my ears are sore.  Do I have big ears?  Maybe.  The cushion is a half inch thick until you put them on.  Then it compresses down to about 3/8, which makes the speaker portion press against my ears.  The sound is quite good, not the best I've heard, but suits my purpose, which is for editing music.  The bass is a little heavy for my taste, but more closely resembles what I hear from my room speakers.  Highs are decent.  The response seems reasonably flat - at least I can hear almost all of the highs, except the really high highs such as the hiss from the electronics.  Quite lite and comfortable, but not as comfortable as I would like them to be.",4
"I wasn't looking to spend too much so I found these. The reviews were great and they're comparable to Beats and other high end sets. Only knock is that the coil isn't detachable and the bass isn't that great. But overall, after a month of use, it's the best one I've ever had.",4
"Great buy!! I read previous recommendations and made up my mind to get this great headphones.  They are as described. Sounds crispy and I think it gets better as you use them.  Very good isolation, despite you can hear when somebody talks which is a good thing.  Frequency response is amazing and seem to be well built too. Excelent ratio quality-price.",5
"These V6's sound amazing. Especially for the price. I purchased them &#34;used&#34; from Amazon warehouse and I can't tell them from a brand new pair. I compared the sound quality against a set of $300 Bose QC 15's that I have for my many business trips and the Sony's sound significantly better. Of course, they are not noise cancelling, so I will still use the QC15 for trips. But for listening around the house or at the office, hands down I would use the V6s.",5
"I  have owned many pairs of head phones over the years and listened to many more.  These offer simply the best sound experience that I have had.  I have even listened with more costly Sony headphones and found them lacking in comparison to these.  I have been able to rediscover some of my music with these wonderful head phones.They are so good that many members of my family have also recently bought them.  If you love to really hear your music, do yourself a favor and buy a pair of these, but make sure you read the warnings - they can cause damage to credit card magnetic strips and mechanical devices with small springs (e.g.  watches).",5
"The venerable V6 is a steal at $70.  I also own a pair of  MDR7506's and the sound is indistinguishable between them.  Hooked up to home or studio gear they sound great.  And it is true you can order inexpensive replacement ear pads from Sony's parts division.The Sennheiser HD280 is the main competitor to the V6/MDR7506.  Connected to studio/home equipment, the HD280 may be a better choice for classical, jazz and acoustic music.  The mids sound a little cleaner than the V6.  Having said that the HD280 is larger than the V6 and requires more power for equal loudness and bass.  iPods and MP3 players just don't have enough juice to power the Sennheiser; the V6 is more efficient.",5
"Wow. Just wow. I've owned these for a year now and I must say I'm so glad I bought them. When I bought these I was on a budget of under $100 and now that I have more funds I've been shopping around for something better, but everything I've listened to is simply inferior in one aspect or another. Either they're uncomfortable or don't sound as well, but either way I gave up and I have gladly decided to stick with my MDR-V6s. The attenuation from ambient sounds is incredible, especially in a car/plane. You can have the volume either as low as it goes or pumped up and these headphones deliver without missing a beat. Only pitfall is my head gets a little warm and my hair gets tussled but I'm ok with it.",5
The Pro's1. Very comfortable and lightweight2. Used with an amp the volume gets real loud3. Coil cable to move around real easy4. Very portable and easy to fold upThe Con's1. These headphones are trash when it comes to durabilty2. They have no bass at all3. The highs get real loud that it becomes very uncomfortableSummary: If you like loud music with no BASS at all then these are your headphones.(BUYER BE WARE SPEAKERS ARE KNOWN TO BLOW OUT WITH THE SLIGHTES BIT OF BASS)It just so happen to me the day I got the pair from amazon my right speaker blew out within 1hr.I packed it up and returned it all with in the same day. Don't waste your money and just buy something else.,2
"Arrived reasonably quick.  This headphone is from the last generation (age-wise).  It has better quality than many current more expensive name-brand models by different manufacturers.  Good sound quality for the money.  However, I have a big head and feel the headphone clamming on my head overly tight just like several other reviewers have commented.  My son loves it and it doesn't bother him.  He is using it all the time.",4
"Terrific headphones with great balance top-to-bottom.  Nice bass, lots of detail, maybe slightly (very slightly) rolled off in the treble.  This is the Shure vMR-TypeV of headphones.  A big plus:  Very efficient so can be used with lower output devices (think iPods and CD players with built-in headphone jacks).  I've compared the Sony's to the Grado-SR80i and I think it's close but they don't sound alike...but then there's the comfort issue:  You wear the Sony's long enough and your ears are going to get sweaty; otherwise I find the Sony's very comfortable.  If you don't like the ear pads, B&H apparently offers velour ear pad replacements (from Pearlstone) that might help.  BTW, I own two of these headphones:  One from ~15+ years ago and a recent pair.  They sound identical.",5
I use these every day at work. Comfortable. Great sound. Much better build and sound quality than any other pair I've owned. Tried to talk the kid into these instead of the silly Beats but couldn't do it. Sound quality is a distant second to looks apparently.Could only be better by allowing for easy cord removal. I almost never need a 3m coiled cord. I'll probably follow one of the excellent DIY cord replacements online.,5
"It says a lot about a product these days when it's been on the market for more than 20 years. With today's 2-3 year product cycle, old technology becomes outdated and obsolete fast, forcing many once revered products into retirement. This is extremely impressive when you consider the company that makes these headphones is Sony; a huge multinational corporation that rarely has any one product out for more than 2 years. So why have they stuck around for so long? Simple; because they're amazing. No set of headphones in this price class (and several above) can hope to come close to how balanced these things are. All frequencies are represented accurately; just as they were recorded and without any coloration. Bass lines aren't bloated mess's like in many modern headphones, mid range frequencies are as they should be; in existence, and treble is highly detailed without scraping at your ears. Though not as detailed as a set of $500 headphones, these are not anywhere close to that. Hovering around $65 most days, these cans provide incredible value. Don't take this the wrong way; they're not amazing for what they are, they're amazing period. Buy these for editing, sound stage monitoring, or neutral listening and you won't be disappointed. Though if you buy these because you want ""street cred"" and bass that makes your heart beat backwards, you clearly didn't understand a word I said.",5
"Sony MDR-V6 headphones are by far the best headphones out there for the money. I listened to Audio Technica and Dr.Dre's Beats headphones and In my opinion the Sony cans sound the best. The Dynamic range is Great. Good Bass, Clarity at the same time. I use mine with ""cMoy Headphone Amplifier"" and it shines truly with it. I am using it from last 12 yrs and I enjoyed it all these years. I am happy to see Sony still makes them. I will definitely order one more headphones for my family members.Pros:Excellent sound stage, Great Highs and Lows. Amazing.Very Comfortable HeadphonesExcellent Build quality, Very sturdy using excellent materialsHeadphone coil is protected by Metal shieldSpring type wire - very usefulFrequency range of headphones is comparable or better than much high end expensive headphonesNo Distortions, No Loose connection problems, No Rust after using for 12 yrs (Replaced ear pads 3 timesin 12 yrs)Love the Matte Black finish on the headphonesCons:None Noticed",5
I use these headphones several times a week on my computer to listen to music.  Fantastic sound quality.  One of the best audio purchases I've ever made and I have three surround systems in my home.  Very pleased indeed.  Would buy again !!,5
"OK, let me start off by saying that i did a lot of research on plenty of headphones before i chose to buy the sony mdr-v6 headphones. I was going to choose the sennheiser 280 until there were several reviews saying that it doesn't go well with an ipod. Anyways these headphones are really good. I'm currently into eight hours of breaking it in. When i first opened these headphones and plugged it into my computer and i was extremely disappointed. The sound quality was almost exactly the same as my cheap $15 headphone and the sound was ridiculously bright(High treble). I was ready to return this product until i thought to myself i needed to break it in first to really judge it. After six hours of breaking it in the sound quality changed dramatically. i mean i thought i was listening to a new pair of headphones. Right now it is sounding great and i'm currently at eight hours of breaking it in. There is still bright sound but not has horrid as when i first plugged it in. People that have these headphones are suggesting thirty hours. I really recommand that everyone breaks in these headphones first before listening to it but i don't recommand this product for people who don't like bright sound and people that are looking to sugar coat their current music.",4
"I was curious how this headphones did in comparison with 7506 and they sound exactly identical, i did plug both on a 3.5 splitter adapter so i can hear both with same song and same equalization, they do sound exactly the same, so now i dont thing the burning in process really exist, my 7506 have easy 400  hrs of use and and i cant hear any difference, so, if you cant decide which ones to by between these 2 just go for the cheaper ones, they also look the same but for some reason they feel cheaper  than 7506, thanks",5
"after doing a lot of research, and trying all headphones i could get my ears on; this choice was exactly what i was looking for. i found most popular brands just had too much bass.  the mdr-v6 headphones rely on the true sounds, that were actually recorded, or meant to be reproduced.  i do have to wear hearing aids- so hearing with these headphones is such a pleasure, while listening to music.  i also really enjoy the comfort, because i plug them into my stereo system for late nite t.v.  needless to say i'am  very pleased with the sony mdr-v6 headphones.  the bass and tones are excellent for me.  from 60's and up rock to country, and a little jazz, these things are powerful- but don't overpower the music.  i waited a few days before doing a review, i have thrown every thing i have at these headphones, and am very pleased.  i recommend them to you!  they were very well packaged, and in a funky display box-- pretty cool.  happy customer, thanks amazon!",5
Thank you Sony. This is a very good headphone. Comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring around.,5
"I purchased these to replace an old pair of V600's that had served me well for nearly a decade, and the quality of sound out of these is as close to perfection as I've ever heard.  It has crisp, clear highs, and the bass is unbelievable.  I'm hearing bass notes that I've never heard before in a pair of headphones, and what's amazing is that the bass doesn't overwhelm or muddy the rest of the sound.  I tested on my laptop and my iPod and set the EQ to flat on both, and the sound is near perfectly balanced: no muddy bass, weak midtones or tinny highs, just beautiful sound that makes listening to music almost a new experience.The phones themselves seem very well constructed and the cups fit comfortably over the ear.  The padding on the cups is thinner than on past models, which make the phones slightly more sleek on the head, but they're every bit as comfortable as the older V600's that I replaced.  The headphone cord extends down from the left ear cup and is coiled and plenty long enough to attach to your laptop or personal music player.  It comes with a 3.5mm to 1/4"" adapter so that you can plug it into full-size headphone jacks on stereos.  If you're going to use it on a home stereo, I'd recommend getting a 6-10' extension cord for it, unless of course you can sit close to your receiver.These are an incredible deal in my opinion.  I can't imagine much better sound at any price.",5
"I have used the MDR-V6 since 1990 when I was just a kid. I have loved using them everyday since the day I first heard a CD play on them. The sound is like liquid sxx in my ear canal. I seriously had to spend some quality time with the lights out and my CD player and these HPs. I still have my original HPs and they sound just like the virgin HPs I unwrapped the day I first heard digital music. I use the MDR7506 on my Digi 002 for Pro Tools sessions, but they sound exactly like these imo. I'm emotionally attached to these HPs though. The MDR7506 is what's in the studio for anyone. I keep these MDR-V6 for ME. I bought these in a special Gold Edition wrapped in red satin pillow with a special screw on 1/4"" adapter. I lost the adapter and the satin pillow hit the file 13. I bought another 1/4"" adapter from a local store for my midi keyboard. I like the ability for these HPs to be worn with one ear folded up so you can listen to yourself sing and listen to your audio at the same time.[...]+++EDIT DEC 2011 **********************************************************-Sony dot com is selling these today and they have better response than 7506 HP , its V6 5-30k and 7506 10-20k[...]-sweetwater dot com sells the beyerdynamic DT250 earpads that are better than the sony ones after a few years. The sony earpads will flake after a year or so. The beyer ones fit the sony v6 and 7506[...]",5
"Can't go wrong with these headphones, the price is right and the sound is very good. I'm no audiophile, and these aren't audiophile priced headphones, but they work great for gaming and music sounds crisp and clear. I would say give these a try if you are looking for reasonably priced headphones that sound good.",5
"Buy them. Light, comfortable and great sound. I will say that I was disappointed at first. Initially they are too (painfully) bright, but after about 30 hours I was really impressed.",5
"These headphones are FANTASTIC.  Not only do they produce incredibly full and clear sound, but they're also lightweight and extremely comfortable.  They fit firmly on your head, cancelling outside noice marvelously without giving the feel that your trapped in a vice.My dad bought a pair of the Koss Pro4AA Titaniums and I have to say that this Sony pair blows those away. While the sound quality is similarly great, the Koss's are about 5X as heavy!  They really put a dent in your head and start to hurt your ears if you wear them for much more than an hour.  The Sony's are much more comfortable and MUCH more lightweight and portable.  I definetely recommend these.  You won't be disappointed.",5
"These sounded great and felt really good for extended wearing. It provides awesome sound isolation. The bass improved after the headphones were broken in after a few days. the v6 provides a natural sound unlike alot of phones that are bass heavy. the thing i did not like was the fact that the hinge that connected the headband to the ear cup is made of plastic and the small wiring leading out of the headband for each ear cup seems like it could get snagged and torn. other than than, these sound great. The downside is that the hinge is plastic.  I hope they will not snap after prolong use.",5
"Bought these to replace a pair of Bose headphones that broke apart after 4 years.  I didn't want to spend a ton of cash on a higher end so after reading reviews; I settled on these.  I have to say, these are better than the $179 bose headphones I bought.  Everything is clear and crisp.  Bass isn't too overwhelming.  I mostly use these to listen to my iPod, but it's almost got me wanting to set up a home studio and get started on some recording to really test them out.  Only drawback is the exposed wires.  I'm afraid that if I adjust these it might pinch.  I will just have to be careful.",5
"I can't say enough nice things about these headphones.  You will not be disappointed.  I've had a pair for nearly 10 years and they are still killing it.  Buy a pair now, or spend three times as much for essentially the same headphone.",5
"I bought these headphones to replace my Sony MDR-V300 headphones, which are the cheapest pieces of plastic garbage I've ever seen.  The V6's produce a beautiful sound and allowed me to hear details in my music I never knew existed.  I've got a Denon-Bose audio setup worth about $2000 and these headphones sound better.These headphones are ridiculous.  They're worth about $300 by my standards.  It also appears they are built to last, as most of the parts are robust plastic or metal instead Sony's normal cheap sh**.Update: the little wires that run to the speakers are unable to withstand an encounter with a housecat.  I strongly recommend not leaving these headphones along with your carniverous pets.",5
"I was looking for some Beats by Dre headphones, but I did not have enough money to cash out $300 for some. I ended up buying the MDR-V6's for about $80. They are worth every single penny, and I think they sound better than the Beats.I like to listen a lot of rock, alternative, hip-hop and electronic. John Mayer, Justin Nozuka, Santana sound so good through these headphones. If you like listening to mainstream hip-hop, the bass in these headphones will go down low without distortion. Listening to Daft Punk and Justice through these headphones made me love them even more.If you love listening to an array of music genres, your ears definitely be satisfied for a lifetime with these headphones.I also use these headphones as studio monitors when I record my own music.",5
"I have owned two pairs of these since 1988.  They were around $100 in 1986 dollars and well worth the cost then.  They lasted about 10 years before abuse finally cracked them.  I went without nice headphones for several years, I am very happy that they still sell this model, they are compact, have great range bass to high and put any of my other headphones to shame.  They are by far the best value in headphones, kudos for Sony for keeping production running.",5
"Pro:Great sound.  Fairly effective sound isolation.  Well built.Cons:i don't find these headphones to be super comfortable for extended wear.1) They are tight on my head2) My ears are bigger than the hole, so they kind of pinch.It might be that after a while they'll stretch out or relax to my head.... and they will become more comfortable.",3
"I did not know that Sony made headphones of this quality, and give this pair highest possible recommendation.Whenever you see words like ""professional quality"" or ""pro ""  or ""studio monitors"" in the product description, run in the other direction. 99% of the time, this is simply exaggeration by an ad copyist who has never been in a recording studio. The V6 is a happy exception, and certainly worth the price of admission.MONITORS?A genuine one must allow you to hear every last detail of the sound/voice/music:--the sound of the reverb of the radio studio--whether or not the announcer is using a pop and/or wind filter--how far from the mike the announcer's mouth is--what brand of mike is being used (for music, Neumann U87 or AKG have a distinctive sound)--mike placement in relation to a large chorus and/or symphony orchestra--acoustics/reverb-time of the performance venue--be able to hear individual tracks in a multi-track overdubYes, YesThere are not many headphones that meet these requirements, but the V6 certainly qualifies with flying colors, regardless of the cost. My old standard, AKG K340 Electrostatic/Dynamic, has long since given up the ghost, but these are a more than adequate substitution (besides, the K340 was a wee bit bright, but the V6 is much more flat).This is both good and bad: really good recordings will sound even better, but bad recordings will sound even worse.ERGONOMICSThe plug is solid aluminum rather than black plastic, but is straight rather than bent.The cord is long, and half of it is coiled, so you get plenty of running room, but is no good for on-the-go uses.Despite the conventional design, it is one of the lightest and most comfortable I have ever used. Many hours of non-stop usage is not unreasonable for this pair.The pads are large and surround your entire ear but are certainly not isolating. They are rather soft, and the material will wear out with time, so expect to replace them at some point (and the replacement pads ain't cheap).",5
"Just like the title of my review says, I've had these since 2009 and haven't had a single issue with them. Sony knew they hit the ball out the park with this model and have kept them in stock. What you get is a high quality set of head phones with a very durable coiled cord and a very convenient bag that has come with me to trips around Europe and back. While they're not the best for noise canceling for when flying (not really intended to) they do make up with great sound, a punchy bass, balanced mids and highs and all without the need for an amp, but don't get me wrong, using an amp is also a great option. The specs are:Impedance : 63 ohmsDriver Unit : 40mmSensitivity (db) : 106dB/mWFrequency Response : 5Hz - 30,000HzHope this helps.",5
"I love these headphones. The sound is superb. Bass, Treble, etc... It's all super good. In the airplane they are just about noise canceling. The only beef I have with these is they are a little loose on the head. I'll take it though. I have used them with a Droid Phone, and I don't think they are quite loud enough sometimes. However, that is just the phones issue I bet.",4
There has been a degeneration of Sony products.  These headphones are cheaply made (wiring is not concealed) and are not as comfortable and well made as my Sony MDR-V600 headphones that are more than 12 years old. Fortunately Sony still sells replacement earphone covers for the good headphones that it formerly made.,3
